# zelenskyy-putin
After building a dataset by scraping 1796 press releases from the websites of the Kremlin and the President of Ukraine using the R package rvest, I conducted an analysis using the R packages tidyquant and tidytext that identified large differences between the press releases of Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy following the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. Whereas Zelenskyy's press releases became more disgusted, sad, negative, angry, and fearful as well as more frequent after that date, Putin's press releases changed by a far lesser extent.
