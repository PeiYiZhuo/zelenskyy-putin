"Ukraine has gained the status of a candidate for the EU membership - it did not fall from the sky, so let’s be proud of it - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-06-24T23:23:00Z,"Good evening, great people of our state! Today was marked by a discussion of the historic decision of the EU Summit - granting Ukraine candidate status. Since this morning and until this moment, there is a dialogue on television, radio, on the Internet about what it means, what conditions Ukraine has to fulfill, how difficult it will be to fulfill and how many years it will take… And I want to say the following on this day. Let's rejoice at least a little. In a quiet, modest way, silently, but rejoice. For ourselves, for our beloved state. Let's feel the moment and the taste of this moment. Imagine conquering Everest. You reached the penultimate point. You didn't look around, didn't even take a breath and talk about the further way to the top. How difficult it will be to overcome the last 1848 meters. Instantly we forgot and devalued our own success. Maybe we should first recall that we have already covered 7,000 meters?! Let's not be ashamed to talk about our achievements. Let’s not be a nation with a short memory and inferiority complex. We say: Ukraine has been granted EU candidate status. Let's say: Ukraine has gained EU candidate status. Did it fall from the sky? Haven’t we endured and done a lot? Today we focus on seven EU requirements. Yes. It's true. But does it scare us? No. Because before that we successfully fulfilled hundreds. Let's not forget about it. Not for bragging, but for the belief that we will definitely overcome this path. We have covered 7,000 meters, so we will not stop - we will reach our Everest. Let's talk at least for a moment not about what awaits us, but about what we managed to do. Because, forgetting about it, we underestimate the significance of this step. There were times when we couldn't take tickets in the evening and fly to Europe in the morning. We stood in line. Documents, visas, etc. Remember? A pile of papers that we carried in the file, which were required by all government agencies with officials who did not report to us and did not submit electronic declarations. High-ranking officials, for the control of which there was neither a special body nor a special court. Deputies with immunity. President who could not be impeached. Land that could not just be bought. Sounds wild? It seems it wasn't with us, doesn’t it? It was. And not so long ago. But we changed everything. Privatization. Land reform. Open-list voting. Decentralization. NACP, Anticorruption Court, administrative services centers, public services online. Diia. Split. Unbundling. Concession. Common aviation space. Industrial visa-free regime. Deoligarchization. Much has been done. Exactly done! Let's not forget that. Let's be proud of ourselves. Respect ourselves. And we repelled the Russians. And we will win. Because when we respect ourselves we will be respected by others. Do not rejoice at a slap in the face of Moscow, but be proud of applause for Ukraine. And that's why I want to see us in one family. Let it inspire you. We deserved it. Realized it. Smile, please. And may God give us all a quiet night. Well, tomorrow is the battle again. With new strength. With new wings. Glory to Ukraine!"
"Share the feeling of freedom, spread the truth about Russia’s war, help Ukrainians – address by the President of Ukraine to the Glastonbury Festival participants",2022-06-24T19:30:00Z,"Greetings, Glastonbury! The festival resumes this year after a two-year break. The pandemic has put on hold lives of millions of people around the world, but has not broken. We, in Ukraine, would also like to live the life as we used to and enjoy freedom and this wonderful summer. But we cannot do that because the most terrible has happened - Russia has stolen our peace. But! We will not let Russia's war break us. And we want to stop the war before it ruins people's lives in other countries of Europe, Africa, Asia, Latin America – they are all under threat now. That is why I turn to you for support! Glastonbury is the greatest concentration of freedom these days. And I ask you to share this feeling with everyone whose freedom is under attack. Spread the truth about Russia’s war! Help Ukrainians who are forced to flee their homes because of this war. Find our United24 charity platform. And put pressure on all the politicians you know to help restore peace in Ukraine. Time is priceless, and every day is measured in human lives. The more people join us in defending freedom and truth, the sooner Russia’s war against Ukraine will end. Prove that freedom always wins! Thank you. Слава Україні!"
The West should complement the sanctions policy by setting limits on the price that Russia receives per barrel of oil - Oleg Ustenko and German Galushchenko,2022-06-24T15:48:00Z,"The European Union, the United States and other partners in Ukraine must complete the strengthening of sanctions against the Russian Federation by imposing a limit on the price of seaborne crude oil, which still brings income to the Russian military machine. This is stated in a joint article by President's Adviser on Economic Affairs Oleg Ustenko and Minister of Energy German Galushchenko for the international media organization Project Syndicate. The authors note that the West has made significant progress in developing sanctions that could prevent Russian President Vladimir Putin's war of aggression in Ukraine. The financial sanctions imposed after the Russian invasion were effective, as the freezing of Russia's central bank reserves largely eliminated much of the country's buffer against shocks. The ruble’s stability has since rested merely on strong capital controls and the continued inflow of hard currency from the sale of oil and gas.  After much debate, EU member states decided to stop buying Russian oil transported by ship, starting just over five months from now. Given that Russia is still exporting around 1.25 million barrels per day to the EU by sea, curtailing these shipments could have a major impact on Putin’s revenue stream, the ruble’s strength, and the already-fragile Russian financial system. But, according to Oleg Ustenko and German Galushchenko, it is unacceptable to wait five months before hobbling the Russian military vehicle. “Every day, more Ukrainians are being killed by Russian forces. We cannot wait. We need the final piece of the strategy to lower the price paid to Russia for its crude and refined products, thereby limiting the Kremlin’s revenues,” the authors note. In May, the EU alone imported more than $5 billion worth of Russian crude by sea, and it is on track to purchase a similar amount in June.  According to the authors, a complete zero-shipment embargo that outlaws oil exports by ship in EU-owned vessels to the rest of the world would likely drive up the price of oil. That would cause economic pain around the world and increase the revenue of Russia. Therefore, this decision must be adapted to the new conditions. Immediate measures must be taken to limit the price Russia receives for a barrel of oil sold. “We support recent proposals by US Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi that would cap the price that Russia receives per barrel of oil. The EU could do this by leveraging its buying power over the next five months, and by exploiting the fact that most Russian oil – around 70% – is carried in ships that are owned, insured, and financed by entities in the EU, the United Kingdom, and other allied countries. These measures are being actively discussed among EU members, and we would encourage all other countries to line up behind them,” the authors note. According to the experts, the marginal cost of production in existing Russian oil fields is exceptionally low, so the price cap could be set at rock-bottom levels to squeeze revenues of Vladimir Putin’s regime. Therefore, oil would continue to be supplied to the international market, preventing a short-run negative effect on price levels worldwide. This price cap could be implemented in several ways, either as a direct restriction or as a tariff. The advantage of a tariff or tax-type structure is that it would generate revenue that could be used to cover the costs of hosting the roughly five million Ukrainian refugees who are currently sheltering in the EU, or to help other low-income people who have been hit hard by the consequences of Vladimir Putin’s war of aggression. According to the authors, if Russia refuses to supply oil at this lower price and stops the production, it will damage its oil wells and effectively resign its membership in OPEC+. The loss to the Russian economy would be immediate, and the pressure on the ruble would become immense. “Without hard currency, Putin would have a difficult time buying components for his rockets and other weaponry from other countries. Without government revenue, Russia will need to print more money to support its war effort – causing its inflation to accelerate and leading to its subsequent collapse,” Oleg Ustenko and German Galushchenko summed up."
"Officially recognized: Ukraine is a future equal partner for 27 EU countries - address by the President, the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada and the Prime Minister",2022-06-24T09:37:00Z,"Fellow citizens of Ukraine! Dear Ukrainian people! 120 days ago, Russia launched a full-scale war against us. For 120 days, Ukraine and its people have heroically been defending their land and their freedom. They are fighting back one of the largest armies in the world. The aggressor, whose population is three times larger than ours, and the area is almost 30 times bigger. Therefore, each of the 120 days of our struggle is historic. But this day is special. Ukraine has officially received the status of a candidate for accession to the European Union. We have heard many statements from many politicians over the years about the course to Europe and the strategic importance of this course. We are not politicians, and we do not have many years, so we have moved from statements to action. From dreams to action. And on February 28, Ukraine applied for EU membership. On Bankova Street, in the Office of the President of Ukraine, in the middle of fortifications and sandbags, in the pauses between the sirens of the air alarm, we signed a document. Many people were skeptical, and considered Ukraine's chances illusory. But we all united. Ukraine united. And the world saw our unique feature: the less they believe in us, the better we perform. Instead of thousands of words, thousands of slogans about moving to the EU, we filled in thousands of pages of the European Commission's questionnaire. What other countries spend a few years doing, we did in a few weeks. At the summit in Brussels, the leaders of the 27 EU member states adopted an official decision: Ukraine receives the status of a candidate for accession to the European Union. And today I want to give a series of answers honestly, clearly and comprehensively for everyone. Fill in our questionnaire. Explain in human language what exactly happened and why it is so important. What does this mean for us and what does this mean for Ukraine? What does this mean and what does it give to Europe? What next? What will we do? What do our partners expect from us? What do we expect from partners? What do we expect from you as a society? And why will we definitely succeed? First, candidate status is not just a new step. This is a new summit. Not a new paragraph, not a new page or even a new section. This is a new volume in the history of Ukraine's European integration, which we started writing today. And as of today, this book has no other options but one: Ukraine will become a member of the EU in the future. As of today, this is fixed at the official level. Candidate status is a mandatory step that most countries have gone through. This is a point of no return. It's not just a new name or a new sign. This is a new status and a new image. Today it is recognized: Ukraine is not a bridge, not a pillow between the West and Russia, not a buffer between Europe and Asia, not a sphere of influence, not a ""gray"" zone, not a transit territory. Not the border between orcs and elves. Ukraine is a future equal partner for at least 27 EU countries. Chairman of The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Ruslan Stefanchuk: EU candidate status is a recognition of our achievements in becoming a mature democratic European society. The strengths of our institutions that continue to work effectively even in times of full-scale war. This is a powerful political message. It will be heard by soldiers in the trenches, every family that was forced to flee the war abroad, everyone who helps bring our victory closer. But it will also be heard in the bunker. We can't change geography. Russia will continue to be our neighbor. But that decision has changed history. And in this case, history has defeated geography. Behind us is a column of Magdeburg law. It was installed in the place where Volodymyr the Great christened Kyivan Rus'-Ukraine. Hundreds of years later, this column was fortified with protective shields against Russian bullets and shells. It is an eloquent symbol of how they want to destroy our culture, our faith, our law. Our history. But history will win. The future will win. Ukraine will win. Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal: Candidate status is a high evaluation of the market transformations that have enabled us to integrate into the EU economy in the energy, digital, customs, transport and other key sectors. These are new perspectives and new opportunities for Ukraine. Access to new EU financial support programs. These are new investments, new projects, new jobs, and support for post-war reconstruction. From now on, our state not only will adopt the European experience, but also will be able to influence the formation of sectoral policies of the European Union. From now on, the process of Ukraine's integration into the EU has become irreversible. From now on, Ukraine has a legal place in the European family. And relations between us and the EU are moving from the neighborhood policy to the enlargement policy. President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy: Even simpler. In the plane of not political, but human relations. Obtaining candidate status is an engagement. A serious step in the relations between Ukraine and the EU. This is not just friendship, not sympathy, but a firm and official intention to become one in the future. In the near future. And as of today, Ukraine will be able to join the work of certain bodies and new EU programs, access to which is limited to third countries. Today we have got rid of this humiliating definition. Ukraine has never been like that in essence, but the official terminology called us that. We got rid of it. We are not a third country. Not a tenth, not a hundredth, we are a future member of the European Union. Today is an important day. We hear the Ode to Joy. Joy, but not euphoria. There is a lot of work ahead. The work of everyone in their place. The cohesion of all branches of government and society is our key to success. Despite the war, we continue to implement EU legislation, norms and rules in all spheres of life. The government will develop an appropriate roadmap. The next steps are known - we have the recommendations of the European Commission. We expect the Verkhovna Rada to approve European integration laws as a matter of priority. We expect all of you to have high civic consciousness, devotion to our values and awareness that no one will build us a European Ukraine, except us. I would like to emphasize a very important point. We are changing Ukraine for ourselves, not for someone else. We are implementing reforms not because of someone's demands, but because of our own beliefs. Ukraine seeks not to join, but to return to the European family. In 2014, the Ukrainian people withstood and defended its European future. But it has chosen it much earlier. Because democracy existed here more than a thousand years ago. In the days of Kyivan Rus’, when people joined in solving important issues in veche. Human rights, human life have already been valued a thousand years ago. Kyivan Rus’ is probably the only medieval state where there was no death penalty. 700 years ago there was a widespread legal system of local self-government. 700 years ago Ukrainian cities already had the Magdeburg law. Historians say that the borders of Europe are the outskirts of the last eastern city, which has the Magdeburg law. It did not take root further than the east of Ukraine. 500 years ago, our ancestors chose their own leaders. Hetmans of Zaporizhzhia and Kish otamans were not appointed by the king, tsar, boyars, nobility or aristocracy, but were elected freely and equally by all Cossacks. For centuries, our people have been committed to the principles of tolerance and respect. Hundreds of national communities and representatives of all religious denominations have lived and still live in peace and harmony on our land. Today Ukraine is fighting for its freedom. And this war began just when Ukraine declared its right to freedom. To its choice of its future. We saw it in the European Union. No matter how someone convinced us that no one wanted us there and a happy tomorrow for Ukraine was possible in a completely different union called Customs. And no matter how surprised they were that Ukrainians prefered freedom over cheap gas. We have chosen the path. The path determined by our people, not someone's power. Chosen by Maidan Nezalezhnosti, not Red Square. The path the Revolution on Granite fought for in 1990, the Orange Revolution stood on barricades for in 2004 and the Heavenly Hundred gave lives for during the Revolution of Dignity in 2014. It was then that the voice of Ukraine sounded loudest. It was there that we firmly chose our path. That is why the Russian Federation appeared on it, annexing Crimea, occupying part of Donbas and later starting a full-scale war against the whole of Ukraine. And that is why this decision of the EU is so important, motivates us and shows: all this is needed not only by us. Having declared our desire to go to the EU, today we finally heard clearly: we are waiting for you! You are welcome! We want to see you as a full member of our family. Hence, all this was not in vain. And our struggle continues not in vain. Ukraine has truly united. Ukraine is truly fighting. Ukraine will definitely win. Truly! Ukraine. Europe. World. Humanity. Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the Heroes!"
This is the biggest step towards strengthening Europe that could be taken right now – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the participants of the EU Summit after granting Ukraine the status of a candidate for membership,2022-06-23T22:26:00Z,"Greetings to all our friends, all leaders-friends of Ukraine! Greetings to all who support freedom! That is how I began my address to the European Council on March 24, three months ago, when I urged you to support us. And that's quite a path we have come in these three months! All of us together: Ukraine, your states and the European Union as a whole. This path is not politics. I believe this is what will always be the starting point of Europe's new history. Europe without division. Europe without ""gray"" zones. Europe that is truly united and that knows how to defend itself, its values, its future. Today you have adopted one of the most important decisions for Ukraine in all 30 years of independence of our state. However, I believe this decision is not only for Ukraine. This is the biggest step towards strengthening Europe that could be taken right now, in our time and in such difficult conditions, when the Russian war is testing our ability to preserve freedom and unity. On the fifth day of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine, we applied to join the European Union. We provided extremely fast and high-quality answers to the questionnaire we received from the European Commission. And here is the desired result today. Today, I would like to reaffirm that Ukraine is capable of becoming a full-fledged member of the European Union. Then, three months ago, I addressed each country of the European Union and indicated at what stage we were, as I thought, in our relations. And today I would like to tell each and every one of you personally what our people feel, and in the same order as it was then. Lithuania stands for us. Thank you, Mr. President!

Mrs. President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola! We are grateful to you personally and grateful to the European Parliament! You were the first to support Ukraine's candidate status the day after our application. Mr. President of the European Council, dear Charles, Mrs. President of the European Commission, dear Ursula, I am grateful to you both for the leadership that has led us all to this day. I am grateful for the sincere help, for the faith in Ukraine, in Ukrainians, in all of us. I have always said that we, Ukrainians, believe in the European Union. Although we remained formally outside the European Union, our country probably had the largest number of flags of a united Europe. They were in the hands of our people during the revolutions. They have been in the hands of our people in the trenches since 2014. I believe that the flag of the European Union will be in every Ukrainian city that we have yet to liberate from the occupation of the Russian Federation. Ukrainian and European flags will also be together when we will be rebuilding our state after this war together. And today in the framework of our joint meeting – the summit of all European leaders, I would like to express special gratitude to our heroes - each and everyone who defends the independence of Ukraine with weapons in their hands, defends the freedom of Europe. Thank you! Thank you for making possible a new history of Ukraine, a new history of Europe - even stronger, even freer. Thank you all so much! Glory to Ukraine!"
"Ukraine will build a European liberalized state, but with strong protection like the Israeli one - President during a meeting with professors and students of Israeli universities",2022-06-23T16:24:00Z,"After the victory in the great war started by Russia, Ukraine will build a European state with significant liberalization of many spheres and processes, but with a powerful security and defense system like the Israeli one. The President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy said this during a conversation with students and professors of leading Israeli educational institutions. ""I think that in many areas we will face things very similar to your beautiful state. We will understand that our neighbor is the Russian Federation. We will understand that Russia, even after we end the war and win, can go on the offensive again in 10-20 years. I'm not saying it will definitely happen. But we no longer trust the Russian neighbor,"" he explained. According to the Head of State, security institutions and security in all public areas, in society will play an important role in post-war Ukraine. ""This applies to both the borders of our state and security within the country. With such a neighbor, bombing, cruise missiles or something else can happen at any time. Therefore, the air defense of our state will also be developed,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. The President also noted that today many Ukrainians already know how to repel the aggressor, and in the future the methods of involving as many citizens as possible in the defense of the state will only improve. At the same time, Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that many things will be liberalized in Ukraine. ""We have already done it, prepared many bills, reforms in our country. Everything must develop very quickly in a country without any bureaucracy,"" he said. The President stressed that these days Ukraine is waiting for the status of a candidate for membership in the European Union, after which it will definitely join the EU, which is a worldview choice for Ukrainians. ""We will rebuild a European state that will be a member of the European Union. But with a powerful defense like that of the State of Israel,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. Reference. Representatives of 7 institutes, 14 scientific schools and research centers of Israel joined the online communication with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Approximate audience is 20 thousand people. The event took place at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and was also broadcast on social networks, YouTube channels and local television."
Address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the community of major educational institutions of Israel,2022-06-23T15:35:00Z,"Dear students! Dear lecturers! Dear attendees! Ladies and Gentlemen! I am grateful for this opportunity. It is an honor for me to address you today. You know, to be honest, I have inquiries - a lot of them - from Israel, in particular from journalists. And I very often disagree. And not just me, frankly speaking. I love your country very much, so I will be honest. I reject these inquiries because, to be honest, sometimes I don't know what to say to people. I have often been to Israel, and it is sometimes difficult for me to respond to such inquiries. Why? I think you will understand me when you hear my address. And I think you will draw your own conclusions. You are smart and independent people. So, if it wasn't for the war, I could visit your wonderful university and talk to you directly with pleasure. But since the beginning of the full-scale invasion by the Russian Federation on February 24, 2022, I remain in Ukraine, in our capital, in Kyiv. The Office of the President of Ukraine is located in the heart of the city. And if you visit Kyiv, you will definitely come here as well. Also, I'm sure you will visit some other places in our capital, in our country. If you walk literally 5 minutes down the street from the building where I am now, you will reach the street where the house of Golda Meir’s family was located - one of the most famous, great Israeli women in the world. She was born in Kyiv. I think you know that. And if you spend some more time and walk the streets next to the one where Mrs. Golda Meir lived, you will see the area that Sholem Aleichem, a prominent Jewish writer, liked so much. You will see the addresses where he lived, the houses next to which he felt cozy, and the museum dedicated to him. Kyiv, like many other cities and communities in Ukraine, is full of such places. Places of remembrance for both Ukrainian and Jewish nations. Places that connect us - and it's not just historical. It's not just plain facts. It is a space of real life of real people, which has forever united our cultures. This is the life in which there is one of the founders of the State of Israel Yitzhak Ben-Zvi and Waldemar Haffkine - one of the most remarkable scientists in human history, who created the first vaccines against plague and cholera. These are the great musician Vladimir Horowitz and the great physicist Abram Joffe. This is Vladimir Jabotinsky, whose mind was so interesting and whose life was so important that his publications are still read today; and this is Natan Sharansky, a politician of the time closer to us, whom we all know well, I personally know him, we all know in both our countries. Of course, these are places of faith without which it is impossible to imagine your culture. In particular, in our city of Uman, which annually received tens of thousands of Hasidic pilgrims. Or in Medzhybizh, where Baal Shem Tov is buried. Of course, these are places of sorrow that all mankind must remember and not forget. The Babyn Yar – a symbol of the Holocaust from bullets, the Drobytsky Yar and other such places on the land of then occupied Ukraine, where the Nazis killed innocent people. We remember all this, we preserve all this. And all this is now under threat. Because how can the places of remembrance be preserved in a total war for the destruction of everything living? Tomorrow, June 24, it will be four months since Russia has launched a full-scale war against Ukraine. And I am sure that each and every one of you has seen that this is a tragedy, has seen what kind of war it is at all, and how Russia is waging it. It destroys our cities. It totally burns down everything in the way of the Russian army or devastates the occupied territories. The main Russian weapons are artillery, air bombs, and cruise missiles. The occupiers do not try to think how to fight. Their tactics are very primitive. They use the maximum of bomb and artillery capabilities so that there is simply nowhere to resist. The Russian army fires missiles at Ukraine every day and every night. The vast majority of them are aimed at ordinary non-military facilities - residential buildings, enterprises, infrastructure, civilians. As of this morning, 2,709 missiles have already been used against Ukraine. And given the pace of their use, very soon the total number will reach 3,000 missiles. These are not unsophisticated missiles. Yes, there are obsolete, Soviet missiles among them, even those of the 1960s. But there are also modern ones. However, there is no selectivity in strikes for Russian missiles, bombs and artillery. That is why, for example, the Menorah in the Drobytsky Yar, which stands there in memory of the Holocaust victims, was also damaged by Russian shelling. They even fired at the Menorah! And should I tell you how many educational facilities the Russian army destroyed in Ukraine? Now you are in one of the wonderful universities, but it is one university - it is very good, but it is one. And imagine 2,000 destroyed educational institutions. How many people are there? Two thousand institutions! Who do you have to be to strike at a university, school or kindergarten with artillery? Russia has become a terrorist state. That's it. I'm sure you all know what the Russian army did to our city of Mariupol. In fact, this city no longer exists. And just four months ago, half a million people lived there. Now there are tens of thousands left in the scorched ruins. And they are threatened by infections that are simply impossible to imagine in today's world. In particular, an infection of cholera that Waldemar Haffkine fought against a hundred years ago. Mariupol is a city where now, week after week, the Russian occupiers are hiding traces of crimes, burying the remains of murdered people in mass graves. The Russian army did the same to Volnovakha and dozens of other towns and villages in Ukraine. And what is happening in the territories where the occupiers managed to enter quickly? Civilians are executed there, refugees are killed on the roads. People are tortured there. People are raped there, including minors - both girls and boys. The Russian troops have set up ""filtration camps"" in which people are tormented. Thousands were killed or mutilated in such camps. The occupiers carry out deportation of Ukrainians to Russia, scattering them in remote regions. And only a few manage to return to Ukraine through the territory of third countries. The number of forcibly displaced persons in our country in just four months is more than 12 million people. 12 million people! Nowhere in Europe in 77 years since World War II has there been anything similar to what Russia has done. Well, tell me how is it possible not to help the victim of such aggression? I ask you this question because I know that you do care, as well as millions, tens, hundreds of millions of people on our planet. So, I will return to where I started my address, to why I rarely, really rarely communicate with journalists when there are inquiries from Israel. I think you will understand. It's difficult for me. I do not know what to say to these distinguished persons. I do not know how to answer the questions I often hear. The questions: what help did Israel provide? And how else can we help? All journalists from all countries ask such questions. I just don't know what to say. Of course, I am grateful to the people of Israel, I am grateful to you for the sincere and emotional support for Ukrainians. I am grateful for all the Ukrainian flags that appeared on your streets - we see it all, we appreciate it all. For all the words that sounded in our support in your society. I am grateful to your great people. But we would like to get support from your government. It seems fair to me. For example, the geographically small state of Luxembourg, with a population of around 600,000, has provided us with defense support in the amount of 15% of its defense budget. The Baltic states - small, neighboring states - provided significant help when they sent us the necessary weapons. Maybe it was not much, but they gave us almost everything since the beginning of the Russian invasion. What about Israel? We understand that it is not easy for you, but we would very much like to write down in that column in front of your state in the tables about the assistance to our army - what we received. We would like to write something down there. We can also look at Poland. This state - like, by the way, the Baltic states - is under direct Russian military threat. It provides us with vital logistical assistance, it sheltered two and a half million Ukrainian migrants fleeing the war. The Czech Republic, Slovakia, Denmark and many, many other countries shelter our people... Democratic countries - everyone did their best to shelter Ukrainian families - we are grateful to them. Most are women with children. They were fleeing the war, seeking refuge. Ireland, with which our culture has no such deep ties as with the culture of Israel, the people of Israel, the history of Israel, has even abolished the visa regime for Ukrainians so that they can simply come and save their lives and their children. Japan, Canada - they made it easier for us to enter. And the Israeli government has suspended the visa-free regime. This is happening right now. I do not want to judge that, I have no right. I have absolutely no right. This is the choice of each and every state. I just want you to think about it yourself. As for sanctions. When countries around the world impose sanctions on Russia, it's not about money, it's not about business. It's about values. It's about general security. It is about the fact that anyone who wants to destroy another nation must be held accountable. Japan - supported, Australia, the United States - many countries and many European states are working together - with us against Russian aggression. And, unfortunately, we have not yet seen Israel join the sanctions regime. However, I would like to thank you for the medications you sent to our country. Unfortunately, I have nothing to say about most of the items of the necessary assistance from Israel to Ukraine. Of course, we have such a situation with several states. It's true. But I can't tell them what I'm telling you. Why? Please remember our ties! How close we are. And how we should understand each other. And how we feel that your society understands these needs. I do not know why there is such a situation and misunderstanding with some government officials. That is why I have decided to tell you this today - I am not indifferent to the future relations between our states and nations. That's why I'm telling you this openly - face to face. I am sure that the war will end. We will win this war. And we have a common future. The great future of great nations, because we have such a great history, a great past. We will have to look each other in the eyes for many, many years to come. Especially your generation, because students are the future and it's wonderful. That's why I composed my address this way. So that you can draw conclusions and so that we can hear each other. With great respect for the history of Israel, for the people of Israel, for all of you. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!"
Yermak-McFaul international group presented the Roadmap of Financial Sanctions,2022-06-23T13:42:00Z,"The international working group on sanctions against Russia has presented the Roadmap of Financial Sanctions. The document contains an analysis of the impact of previously imposed sanctions on the financial system of the Russian Federation, a list of recommendations for increasing pressure on the aggressor state and a map of risks of the implementation of sanctions policy. The developed proposals are based on the dependence of the Russian Federation on Western reserve currencies, markets and banks, in particular for trade. The purpose of the proposed restrictions is to deprive Russia of financial flows that the aggressor directs to sponsor the war. To do this, three steps need to be taken: imposing full blocking sanctions on the entire financial sector of the Russian Federation; complete refusal to provide services and cooperate with the aggressor in the financial sphere; achieving institutional isolation by launching the transition to a new economic policy without Russia's participation. These measures correspond to three levels of new financial restrictions on Russia, which may be implemented in stages over the coming months. Experts from the Yermak-McFaul group have developed detailed proposals for the implementation of these sanctions. First, it is necessary to impose full blocking sanctions on the 30 largest Russian banks with state capital, the Moscow Exchange, the National Settlement Depository, and the National Clearing Center. It is necessary to extend individual sanctions to Russian officials responsible for financial policy. Russia must be recognized as a state - sponsor of terrorism and blacklisted by the International Group Combating Money Laundering (FATF). Gazprombank may remain the only Russian institution for transactions with goods that have not been subject to sanctions. To do this, the bank must obtain a special license, which will allow a limited amount of transactions and completely block other transactions. Secondly, it is necessary to complete the severance of economic relations with Russia. Russia should be removed from Western funds and companies. Businesses and individuals should lose access to investment and other consulting services, asset management, and cryptocurrency markets. The group proposes further imposing of full blocking sanctions against all Russian banks and financial institutions. Third, it is necessary to achieve institutional isolation of the Russian Federation. To this end, it is proposed to introduce strict tools for controlling financial transactions with Russia. Strict, centralized control and regulation of Russia's trade to prevent theft of technology and intellectual property, especially for dual-use goods and services. Comprehensive export control should apply to Russian enterprises. The group also proposes to introduce a new framework for transparency and disclosure of information about companies cooperating with Russia, in order to increase market and social pressure. It is necessary to strengthen the requirements for working with the aggressor and determine the grounds for the introduction of secondary sanctions. The Roadmap of Financial Sanctions, as well as the previous documents of the Yermak-McFaul Group - the Action Plan for Strengthening Sanctions and the Roadmap of Energy Sanctions - will be submitted to the institutions responsible for implementing the sanctions policy. Sanctions pressure on Russia will be continued."
"To liberate our land and achieve victory is our national goal, which we must work on every day - address by the President of Ukraine",2022-06-23T00:20:00Z,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! Today, June 22, is the Day of Mourning and Remembrance of the Victims of War. That war. A war that was to remain forever in the history of the XX century and was never to be repeated. But it is repeated. Today there is no shortage of words that Russia did the same on February 24 as the Nazis did on June 22. Much has been said about this. And I want to add only one thing. Then 1418 days passed from the morning of the invasion to the defeat of the aggressor. We must liberate our land and achieve victory, but faster. Much faster. This is our national goal, and we must work to achieve it on a daily basis. Not only the state, but also every citizen - at the level at which it is possible. From the very morning I continued the telephone marathon for a positive decision on the candidacy for Ukraine. 11 leaders today. Bulgaria. I thanked Prime Minister of Bulgaria Petkov for supporting Ukraine and the development of the whole of Europe with our participation. Latvia. We discussed with Mr. Prime Minister Kariņš the cooperation between our countries, between Ukraine and the European Union, as well as our joint opportunities to protect Europe from the crises that Russia organizes, including the food crisis. Greece. I was glad to hear the words of sincere support for Ukraine. Mr. Prime Minister and I have the same vision of the historical significance of the decision that is expected from the European Council. Sweden. Prospects for bilateral cooperation and cooperation at the level of European structures were discussed with Prime Minister Andersson. Estonia. Thanked Mrs. Prime Minister Kallas for her continued support of Ukraine. The priorities of our cooperation and the agenda in the context of the NATO Summit in Madrid next week were discussed. Czech Republic. Fruitful conversation with Mr. Prime Minister Fiala. The priorities of the Czech presidency of the Council of the European Union in the next six months were discussed. And now I am sure that the voice of the Czech Republic is in favor of Ukraine. Belgium. I thanked Mr. Prime Minister De Croo for supporting our European perspective and invited him to visit Ukraine. I hope that Belgium will take a significant part in the post-war reconstruction of our country. Austria. I am grateful to Chancellor Nehammer for the political and humanitarian support, for understanding the needs of Ukraine. We can do a lot to develop relations between our states. Slovenia. We agreed with Mr. Prime Minister Golob that we can strengthen cooperation between our countries. I thanked him for the consistent support of the candidacy for Ukraine. Moldova. I spoke with President Sandu. We supported each other on the eve of an important meeting of the European Council. And we will help each other to complete this path to the European Union faster. Today I spoke again with President of Lithuania Gitanas Nausėda. I expressed full support to him over the situation around the Kaliningrad region of Russia. Tomorrow I will continue this marathon - we must provide maximum support to our state. We expect a key European decision tomorrow night. The occupiers struck at Mykolaiv, seven missiles. Fortunately, no one was killed. Five people were injured. There were strikes at the Kharkiv region as well. There are casualties. There were strikes at the borders of the Chernihiv and Sumy regions. In Donbas there are massive air and artillery strikes. The goal of the occupiers in this direction remains the same - they want to destroy the whole Donbas step by step. Entire. Lysychansk, Slovyansk, Kramatorsk - they aim to turn any city into Mariupol. Completely ruined. That is why we repeatedly emphasize the acceleration of weapons supplies to Ukraine. Parity is needed on the battlefield as soon as possible to stop this devilish armada and move it beyond the borders of Ukraine. I am grateful to the United States for its assistance in investigating war crimes in Ukraine. I am grateful to Mr. Eli Rosenbaum for his willingness to join in the establishment of justice - he is one of those American investigators who managed to expose many Nazis. Our joint investigation team must be as strong as possible so that none of the Russian criminals avoid punishment. And this will be one of the largest contributions to the protection of international law and order of our time. Just as September 1, 1939 and June 22, 1941 ended in Nuremberg trials, February 24, 2022 must end in a fair tribunal. Russia must be held accountable for all the evil it has brought to Ukraine. Today I signed a new decree on awarding our heroes. 195 combatants were awarded state awards, 17 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all whose lives were taken by the occupiers! Eternal glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine! We are preparing for the historic decision of the European Council, there are only a few hours left. Glory to Ukraine!"
EU candidate status will be a new page in the history of Ukraine and a great motivation for the army and society - President during communication with students,2022-06-22T22:07:00Z,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is convinced that the member states of the European Union will support granting Ukraine the status of a candidate for EU membership, which will be a historic event and a great motivation for the Ukrainian army and society in the struggle for independence and territorial integrity. ""I strongly believe that in these crucial days Ukraine will receive the status of a candidate for membership in the European Union. We have come a long way for it… Our people, our revolutions, our war… And this status is such an important moment. This is a transition to another page of our history. A very positive transition. I believe that all these 27 European countries will endorse this status for us,"" the Head of State said during a conversation with the student community of major Canadian universities. According to him, this decision will motivate the Ukrainian army and society. ""It is a great motivator for unification, and therefore a great motivator for Ukraine's victory,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Answering to the question who inspires him personally, the President said that the Ukrainian people are such an inspiration. ""There are many such examples. This is an ordinary Ukrainian farmer who could block the road to Russian tanks on a tractor at the time of the invasion. An ordinary woman in our village who stopped the APCs, IFVs with bare hands. Our beautiful ordinary children who were in the apartments when the enemy missile hit them. And they remained in our history and in our memory,"" he said. The President stressed that he is proud and inspired by the Ukrainian people, his people, who heroically defend our freedom. ""Because we can talk about the values we protect. And the main value is our people. This is our treasure, and this is my idol,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. During the conversation with the students, the President also emphasized that after the victory the country will be in great need of young Ukrainian specialists who have studied or gained new experience abroad. For them to return to Ukraine, the state must ensure a reliable security situation and create favorable conditions for business development and personal development. ""We do not have time for any bureaucratic chains, because we are a state at war, and the country will have to be rebuilt very quickly,"" he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that despite the full-scale war, many state institutions withstood in the country, and the financial and digital sectors function stably because Ukraine managed to resist cyberattacks by Russia. ""Security, climate and the most liberal approaches to business. I think these are the most important conditions we can create for the current generation. But without you, without young people who are gaining knowledge and experience, it will be very difficult to build all this. So be sure to come back with modern knowledge and, most importantly, with desire. The desire to live and build an independent Ukraine. And we will definitely defend it, I am sure of that,"" the Head of State summed up."
Volodymyr Zelenskyy – to students of Canadian universities: Do not allow forgetting about the war in Ukraine,2022-06-22T21:35:00Z,"If Russia seizes Ukrainian territories and kills Ukrainians with impunity, it can set an example for other states in any part of the world, so the whole world must join in the fight against the aggressor, and in no case can you get tired of the war in Ukraine. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a conversation with the student community of major Canadian universities. ""As for democracy, when we say that we are fighting for common values, it is absolutely true, because war has no distance. We are fighting for the same values that you and any country that wants to live in a democratic world have. Just to choose how to live, where to study, what to eat, what to do, who to love - this is the right to choose. This is the most precious thing we have. This is the most important meaning of democracy - your right to choose,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, answering students' questions. He stressed that allowing the President of Russia and the Russian army to seize the territories of other countries, destroy cities and kill people would be an example for other states to do the same. ""There are probably other such leaders in the world. And if it works here (in Ukraine - ed.), it can work at the other end of the world, on any continent. This cannot be allowed to anyone. That is why it is necessary to take preventive steps and punish even if a person only thinks about it,"" the Head of State said. According to him, the whole world should be involved in counteracting the aggressor, and this must be done as powerfully as if this war is taking place on their territory. Then there will be a result. Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated that Ukraine needs weapons, financial, humanitarian support and constant sanctions pressure on the aggressor. ""All this will never be too much as long as the war lasts,"" he said. The President called on students from around the world studying in Canada to appeal to the leadership of their countries about the importance of supporting Ukraine. ""Each and every one of you can do it. Everyone is getting tired of the war, so by your actions, thanks to social networks, communication with friends, taking to the squares of the cities of your countries, supporting Ukraine, do not let anyone above, in bureaucratic corridors, forget about what is happening in Ukraine, forget about war. Please do not get tired of the war. Do not get tired of the war in Ukraine,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged."
"We are fighting for our future, our freedom, our land and the opportunity to build a new Ukraine - speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the student community of major Canadian universities",2022-06-22T21:20:00Z,"Ladies and Gentlemen! We are ready to amaze the world! I said these words in Toronto, at the Conference on Reforms in Ukraine, 3 years ago. Who could have imagined that 3 years later, the subtext and meaning of these words would undergo a ""large-scale reform”. 3 years ago, describing my vision of change in Ukraine, I gave the example of a team that you all know very well. This is the Toronto Raptors. 2019 NBA Champions. To win when no one expects that. To do the impossible by uniting. That's how I described our state goal and the common task of all Ukrainians. Who could have imagined that 3 years later it would sound completely different. Who could have imagined how big the difference would be between these times, between then and now, between the summer of 2019 and the summer of 2022. Those were different times. We strived for slightly different victories. We were building a slightly different state. A country of transparent institutions, equal and fair rules, successful and free people. Today, the walls of our buildings are ""transparent"" in the literal sense of the word - destroyed by Russian missiles and bombs. The rules of the game apply to everyone, but in a different sense. These are the rules of survival. They are equal, but not fair. Tough, cruel and simple. Shoot on the front, help in the rear. You hear an air alarm go down to the shelter. You hear the sound of enemy military equipment, stand up for the defense of your country. In 2019, I talked about peace in the east of Ukraine - a lot was said with Chrystia (Freeland - ed.) and Justin Trudeau - the liberation of Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea. We did everything possible for this, on all existing platforms, with the help of all existing diplomatic tools. Ukraine sincerely wanted and strived for this. But the other side wanted and strived for something else. We saw this ""something else"" in the morning of February 24. As a result, in 2022, Mariupol, Kramatorsk, Severodonetsk, Berdyansk, Melitopol and dozens of other cities and villages of Ukraine joined the words peace, liberation, Donetsk and Luhansk. We conducted the Crimea Platform. Today we are fighting back the aggression of the Russian Federation so that in the future there is no need to hold the Kherson Platform, the Mariupol Platform, the Kharkiv Platform and dozens of other platforms for the deoccupation of Ukraine's sovereign territories. Three years ago, my goal was a major infrastructure reform. Ukraine started the Large Construction. And it was impressive. Three years later, Russia launched a special military operation. We restored and created new roads, bridges, kindergartens, schools, hospitals, stadiums. Russia has been creating missiles and bombs all this time to destroy it all. Three years ago, in Toronto, I also talked about the restoration of Donbas. To do this, we gathered hundreds of investors and companies from around the world in Donbas and held a forum in Mariupol. Three years later, this city does not actually exist. It is erased from the face of the earth. In 2019, we talked about reconstruction in the east of Ukraine. According to preliminary estimates, this required about $ 10 billion. At the time, that figure seemed shocking. Three years later, it has grown exponentially, and now we need hundreds of billions of dollars to rebuild. Now, in addition to the east, we are talking about the south, north, center and west of our country. Ukraine and Canada are separated by the ocean and 7 thousand kilometers, but there is a full mutual understanding between us. Ukraine and Russia are separated by a common border, but there is a huge abyss between us. In words, actions and most importantly - values. In 2019, I spoke about my dream country. About a state where the highest value is a person. In 2022, we are fighting against the aggressor whose highest value is weapons. My goal was large-scale digitization of Ukraine. And we became a State in a smartphone. The goal of Russia is large-scale occupation of Ukraine. And we became a country in army boots. A country in tanks, aircraft, ships. A country in trenches and shelters. Our way of life changed, but not our worldview. The path by which we are going to the goal changed, but the goal remained the same. Lecturers of our universities sometimes lecture their students from trenches, online, via Skype. Our teachers record video lessons and tasks for pupils in the subway, during the air alarm siren. Our servicemen can get married via Zoom without leaving the frontline positions. 3 years ago our goal was real decentralization. 3 years later the goal of Russia became “denazification” that no one understands. 3 years ago we spoke about capable local self-government. 3 years later we are talking about powerful territorial defense. Those were different times, but our goals remained the same. The only amendment is that to implement all this we are today fighting against the second army of the world. We are fighting for our future, our freedom, our land. Just as 80 years ago, during World War II. Today is a special day in Ukraine. The day when we recall the feat of our ancestors, express gratitude to them for our life and the opportunity to build a new Ukraine. The day of mourning and honoring the memory of the war victims, which we mark on June 22. Exactly on this day in 1941 the Nazis started bombing Kyiv. At 4 am. Those were different times, a different occupation, a different war, but our morale, striving for freedom, struggle and our goal haven't changed. And on February 24, 2022, when Russian missiles hit Kyiv and the whole of Ukraine also at 4 am, we stood up for our country. Today, we are fighting for the future of our children and grandchildren, for their life and opportunity to build a new Ukraine. We have already amazed the world. We have united to do the impossible. We will definitely win, although no one expected that. For the sake of our peaceful, free and democratic future. And these will be different times. What exactly and how we will cover the path to them - I think we will discuss that today here. Thank you very much for the opportunity. Thank you for the meeting. Thank you for your support, Canada. Glory to Ukraine!"
Italy's defense and political support for Ukraine is an investment in our common free future - Andriy Yermak,2022-06-22T19:35:00Z,"Italy's defense and political support for Ukraine is an investment in its own security and the common free future of both countries. This was stated by Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak in an interview with the TV project Porta a Porta of the Italian TV channel Rai 1. ""We are very grateful to the Italians, to the Italian government, to all of you for what you are doing for Ukraine. We will never forget that. We are grateful for the weapons and the loud voice in support of granting Ukraine the status of a candidate for EU membership. But please understand: this is not a charity, but an investment in your own security, in our common peace, in our common free future,"" Andriy Yermak said. The Head of the President's Office noted that today the Russian aggressor is trying to occupy the entire territory of Ukraine, as happened with Crimea and part of Donbas. Commenting on the impact of the war in Ukraine on the economic situation in Italy, Andriy Yermak stressed that today Ukrainians are giving their lives for the future of Europe. ""Sometimes you pay with money, and Ukrainians pay with their lives. And not just for themselves. One of the hits of the very popular Italian singer Mina has the following lines: Non cambi mai. These words can be addressed to Russia: ""You never change."" So if they succeed in Ukraine now, Russia will not stop. And the Italians will have to pay more. And it will be good, if only with money,"" Andriy Yermak said. The Head of the President's Office stressed that Ukraine will fight the Russian aggressor as long as it takes to win. ""We are not afraid of anyone, we are fighting for our country, for our land. We don't need someone else's property. We are fighting for what is ours,"" Andriy Yermak said. According to him, for more than three months Ukraine has been proving on the battlefield that the truth is on its side, and that is why the support for our country by European partners is very important today. ""If we receive all the support we have agreed upon and which was confirmed by our partners in time, our victory will be faster. And the risks for the whole of Europe that this war will engulf other countries will be reduced,"" the Head of the President's Office stressed. Andriy Yermak noted the importance of the visits of European leaders to Ukraine, in particular the visit of the Prime Minister of Italy Mario Draghi, which took place last week. According to the Head of the Office of the President, the Italian Prime Minister had an opportunity to see the consequences of the crimes of the Russian occupiers during his visit to the suburbs of Kyiv. ""There is only one way out (of the situation related to Russian aggression - ed.) - our victory. And our victory will be yours as well,” the Head of the President's Office emphasized. He noted that he has special respect for the history of Italy and the traditions of this country, so he delivered part of his speech on the air in Italian. ""I want to say that I have been to Italy many times, and each time it impressed me with something. Nature. Culture. History. People. But most of all - your sincerity and hospitality. And, probably, these features are what unite our peoples the most,"" Andriy Yermak said."

The Head of the Office of the President and the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine noted the leading role of the United States in defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and expressed gratitude for the comprehensive support for our state.
"Address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the participants of the Embrace Ukraine - #StrivingTogether charity telethon, which took place in Amsterdam",2022-06-22T11:54:00Z,"Ladies and gentlemen! Greetings from Kyiv! We are just days away from the European Union's historic decision on Ukraine. And I am sure that none of us – none of you – have any doubt that Ukraine should get a positive decision. We deserve it! And we deserve it not only for our bravery and our fight for freedom. Russia's attack on Ukraine has restored to our memory the worst pages of history. Russian bombs are destroying cities. Russian soldiers are killing thousands of civilians. Russia is even carrying out mass deportations of Ukrainians. What is this?  This is Russia's attack against the whole free Europe – against our common values. Against human rights, the rule of law and conventions that protect everyone in Europe and the world. We will not allow to destroy our values!  I believe that together we can end the war with our victory as quickly as possible and we will rebuild everything Russia has destroyed. United Europe is definitely stronger than any tyranny! Even during such a brutal war, Ukrainian democratic institutions have been preserved. Even now we are extending the reach of the European values – yesterday the Ukrainian Parliament ratified the Istanbul Convention.  And no matter how much pressure Russia puts on us, we remain confident that Europe's future is bright and free, because we all stand together to protect it! I am grateful to all those who support us. Thank you for this sincerity, Amsterdam! Looking forward to a positive European decision for Ukraine! Embrace Ukraine, strengthen Europe! Слава Україні!"
Every day we fight for a positive decision of the European Union on the candidacy for Ukraine and for the supply of modern weapons - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-06-21T23:38:00Z,"Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today was a day of extremely active foreign policy activity - almost a marathon of phone conversations. We are increasing the number of those who stand for Ukraine's candidacy and adding confidence that the decision on Friday will be positive. Slovakia. In a conversation with Prime Minister Heger, we coordinated our positions on the eve of the session of the European Council. Lithuania. I thanked President Nausėda for the decision of the Three Seas Initiative Summit to grant Ukraine the status of a partner-participant. We also coordinated our steps. Hungary. There was a very fruitful conversation with Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. I invited him to visit Ukraine and thanked him for the important support for our sovereignty and territorial integrity of our state. We agreed to develop cooperation in the energy sector. Portugal. We agreed with Prime Minister António Costa to involve his country's experience in our rapprochement with the European Union. Next - Denmark. I expressed gratitude for supporting Ukraine, including with weapons. I also noted the speech of Mrs. Frederiksen in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, which took place today. Spain. In a conversation with Prime Minister Sánchez I noted that our cooperation would strengthen both Ukraine and the entire European Union. The possible outcome of the NATO Summit in Madrid, which will take place in late June, was discussed. Ireland. I noted Ireland's active support for our European integration and invited Irish Prime Minister Martin to visit Ukraine. Croatia. I am confident that we can expand our cooperation both bilaterally and at the level of European structures. I thanked Prime Minister Plenković for his support of Ukraine. I was happy to see in Kyiv a great friend of our state - Prime Minister of Luxembourg Bettel. And I would like to draw your attention once again to the assistance from Luxembourg. 15% of the defense budget of this state – this was a contribution to the defense of Ukraine. Both the greatness and the nobility of the state are immediately felt. Today, Mr. Bettel visited the cities of the Kyiv region that had been liberated from the occupiers. I am grateful to him for his sincere understanding of our people and for Luxembourg's readiness to take part in the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine. My schedule for tomorrow is as busy as today. I will do my best to ensure that the historic decision of the European Union is adopted. This is important for us. By the way, today, without delay, I signed the law on ratification of the Istanbul Convention adopted yesterday. Protecting all people from violence and discrimination is our principle. In all negotiations, I always emphasize that the seventh package of the European Union sanctions is needed as soon as possible. Russia must feel a constant increase in pressure for the war and for its aggressive anti-European policy. Another Russian threat to Lithuania, another wave of energy pressure, another batch of lies from Russian officials about the food crisis are all arguments to agree on the seventh package of sanctions. The situation on the frontline is without significant changes. With the help of tactical moves, the Ukrainian army is strengthening its defense in the Luhansk region, which is really the toughest area right now. The occupiers are also putting serious pressure on the Donetsk direction. In the Kharkiv region there is brutal and cynical Russian artillery shelling. It will not give anything to the occupiers, but the Russian army is deaf to any rationality. It simply destroys, simply kills - in this way it shows its command that it is not standing still. In the south we defend our Mykolaiv region, our Zaporizhzhia, and gradually liberate the Kherson region. And just as actively as we fight for a positive decision of the European Union on the candidacy for Ukraine, we fight every day for the supply of modern weapons for our country. We do not decrease our activity for a single day. The lives of thousands of people depend directly on the speed of our partners - on the speed of implementation of their decisions to help Ukraine. Today I signed two major decrees on awarding our defenders. At the request of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 210 combatants were awarded, 3 of them posthumously. At the request of the Minister of Internal Affairs, 255 warriors of the National Guard of Ukraine were awarded, 41 of them posthumously, 41 border guards, 12 of them posthumously, and 45 policemen. And I want you to realize that when I talk about signing such decrees, it's not just a routine and not something mechanical. It is only thanks to the mass courage and wisdom of our people on the battlefield that Ukraine lives and can really count on victory. Eternal glory to all who fight for our state! Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
Ukraine is constantly working on the release of prisoners and counts on the fulfillment of the commitments undertaken by the partners - Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-06-21T18:59:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy notes that the state is doing everything possible at the political level to speed up the release of Ukrainian prisoners, but this is a complex process that is professionally handled by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. ""It's a very complicated issue. Many details cannot be revealed. We really want the exchange to take place, the partners who have committed to helping with this exchange to keep their word. Not only do we believe in this, but also we are working, it is carried out by our Main Intelligence Directorate. It is they who control this process. We will wait for the result,"" the President said during a conversation with the media following a meeting with Prime Minister of Luxembourg Xavier Bettel in Kyiv. Volodymyr Zelenskyy recalled that several people had recently been returned from captivity, including paramedic Yulia “Tayra” Payevska. The President would like to avoid delays in the issue of the return of people, because captivity has a negative impact on their condition. ""After all, we do not know what exactly is happening now with their condition and what help they receive, except in words. Intelligence knows more. And I believe that this process is in their hands today,"" the President explained. He noted that the state must do everything possible in this matter at the political level. ""We involve our partners in this process as much as possible: the Red Cross, the United Nations, several states that have certain influence on the aggressor country,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy."
President of Ukraine met with the Prime Minister of Luxembourg in Kyiv,2022-06-21T18:09:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met in Kyiv with Prime Minister of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg Xavier Bettel, who is on a visit to our country. ""This visit is very important for us, for me personally. It confirms: to be in Ukraine now, to be with Ukraine now is to be on the bright side of history, no matter how difficult it may be,” the Ukrainian President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the Prime Minister of Luxembourg for the assistance provided by his country and him personally to Ukraine since the first days of Russia's full-scale war against our state. ""We have been in constant contact, and Luxembourg has always helped us… I am very grateful on behalf of our people, and I will say in detail: Luxembourg has allocated 15% of its defense budget to our defenders,"" the President said. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, during the meeting in Kyiv, the parties discussed issues of assistance to Ukrainians who took refuge in Luxembourg after the start of the war. ""We discussed the lives of our children, families and students, whom Luxembourg welcomes very warmly. I am grateful that they feel at home, but temporarily at home, because it is very important for us that all citizens of Ukraine return home, as our state must be restored after the war,"" he said. The leaders discussed the restoration of Ukraine. The issue of reconstruction will be discussed in more detail at a conference in Lugano, Switzerland, in July this year, and Luxembourg will be involved. ""We also discussed in detail the sanctions policy against the Russian state. Challenges related to the blockade of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov by the Russian fleet, which leads and will lead to a shortage of food in the world, especially in Asia, Africa and some European countries. We also discussed ways out of this collapse, out of this impudence,"" the Ukrainian President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that the Prime Minister of Luxembourg began his visit to Ukraine by visiting the occupied towns of the Kyiv region and shared his feelings about what he saw. ""I would like to express gratitude for the humanitarian, armed and, first of all, humane assistance to our citizens provided by Luxembourg and personally the Prime Minister. You are always our welcome guest,"" said the President of Ukraine. For his part, Xavier Bettel stressed that his visit was a confirmation of Luxembourg's solidarity with Ukraine. He stated that the Duchy would support our state both in the fight against Russian aggression and in the post-war recovery. ""Luxembourg is doing everything it can to help Ukraine. At the humanitarian and financial levels. Moral support is also important. I want to tell Ukrainians that their future is with us, and it will be built together, jointly,"" said Xavier Bettel. The Prime Minister said that after reviewing the conclusion of the European Commission on Ukraine's application for EU candidate status, his country advised other EU members to support the decision in favor of Ukraine. ""I think there will be a decision that will become a powerful signal not only for you, but also for us. This is not only a consequence of the war against Ukraine, it is the protection of our values, for which so many people have already died,"" he said. Xavier Bettel said he was impressed by what he saw in Bucha, Borodyanka and Irpin, in particular destroyed buildings, bridges and human lives. He stressed the importance of providing Ukraine with the necessary weapons so that our state can defend itself and win the war."
Kyrylo Tymoshenko and the UK Ambassador discussed plans to restore and rebuild Ukraine after the war,2022-06-21T16:02:00Z,"Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Kyrylo Tymoshenko met with Ambassador of the United Kingdom to Ukraine Melinda Simmons. Kyrylo Tymoshenko thanked for the strong and consistent support of the British government to the Ukrainian people in their struggle for independence. The Deputy Head of the Office of the President noted that today one of the key issues for the de-occupied territories of our country is demining. Accordingly, support from foreign partners in the form of equipment for the State Emergency Service of Ukraine is extremely important. Assistance in the form of fuel and lubricants is also important today, as there is a shortage of fuel due to Russia's constant missile strikes at Ukrainian refineries. ""Pursuant to the instruction of the President of Ukraine, we monitor all the destruction of infrastructure due to the war to have information on each destroyed or damaged object. The National Council for the Reconstruction of Ukraine, established by the President, is currently working out formal mechanisms to record the damage caused by the war,"" Kyrylo Tymoshenko said. He informed Melinda Simmons about the Plan of Recovery and Modernization of Ukraine developed pursuant to the President's instruction, which will be implemented with the help of Western partners after the victory. In addition, Kyrylo Tymoshenko reminded of the fast recovery plan, which provides for the restoration of housing infrastructure so that people can return home, as well as educational institutions, critical medical facilities, water, electricity and heat supply networks. The Deputy Head of the Office of the President noted that in order to implement all these plans, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Head of the Office of the President Andriy Yermak are negotiating with partner countries and working actively to establish direct cooperation between local governments and partner countries. ""We are preparing a memorandum on practical assistance from the association of Europe's largest cities - Eurocities. We also promote the interaction of our cities with associations of cities in different European countries. In addition, we involve international organizations such as UNICEF, etc. in the implementation of reconstruction projects,"" he said. Kyrylo Tymoshenko emphasized that Ukraine very much hopes for the support of Great Britain in the reconstruction of the city of Kyiv and the Kyiv region, which is one of the most affected by the war. For her part, Melinda Simmons noted that such substantive meetings give a clear understanding of the preparations for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war. The Ambassador stressed that Great Britain will be as actively involved in the process of rebuilding Ukraine as it supports our country during the war politically, financially and militarily."
I believe that the power of human creativity is greater than the power of a nuclear state - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the Cannes Lions International Festival,2022-06-21T12:58:00Z,"Greetings from Ukraine, Cannes Lions! These days I was on the frontline. Our brave soldiers, our brave defenders are fighting back against the Russian army. 117 days ago, everything changed for Ukraine. We are defending against a nuclear state that has unlimited access to money and has disregarded any limits on violence. I'll be honest with you – the end of this war and its circumstances depend on the world's attention. And that's why I need allies. We need people like you.  You are the most creative people in the world – always on the cutting edge. Whether it’s the Refugee Flag or the Fearless Girl, the Ice Bucket Challenge or the Rivers of Light – every time you find words and images to reach the depths of the human soul, you make people talk about issues everyone would otherwise overlook. I am sure that you will do a lot more to promote Ukrainian bravery. Your campaigns and your work will make our fight for freedom legendary. Because we are fighting not only for our own freedom but for the freedom of the entire democratic world; for all of those who cannot even imagine the extent of tyranny and censorship that exist in Russia. Now you can bring peace to Europe simply by applying your professional qualities. I believe that the power of human creativity is greater than the power of a nuclear state that is stuck in the past.  Speak of Ukraine! Don't let the world switch to something else! The world must remember that Ukraine is fighting for freedom. This fight must end in our victory as soon as possible. Your every success will mean saving thousands of lives. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!

We are moving towards the decision of the European Council on Ukraine's candidacy; Russia is very nervous about our activity - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-06-21T00:01:00Z,"Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Step by step, we are going through a crucial week and we are doing everything every day so that no one has any doubts that Ukraine deserves the candidacy. We prove every day that we are already part of a united European, I would even say, value space. Now the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada have already left, and I am here. And you know, I'd like to thank them today. We often criticize them, but today they did a very good job. I am grateful to all our people's deputies who supported our European integration. I would like to note the vote in favor of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence. This Convention is often called the Istanbul Convention - according to the place of signature. It has been ""undermined"" in Ukraine for decades. But its main content is simple - it is the obligation to protect against violence and various forms of discrimination. I would also like to thank the deputies who supported the Law on Waste Management. This is an important environmental document. We have been struggling for it for three years. The law has been rejected several times due to oligarchic influence, and now it has been passed. Finally. Thank you. The Anticorruption strategy was approved today. This is also very important. I hope that the Rada will continue to work with the same significant results. I delivered four addresses today. The first was to the participants of the Three Seas Initiative Summit. It is a powerful regional association in Europe. 12 states between the Baltic, the Adriatic and the Black Sea. Before addressing, I spoke with President Duda. We coordinated our positions with Andrzej. And at the summit it was decided that Ukraine acquires a status that will allow it to become a full member of the Three Seas Initiative. For us, these are significant economic opportunities, modernization of transport, communications and networks. This is another line of close cooperation between Ukraine and the EU states. By the way, we have good news from our border with Poland. In the framework of the Open Border project, the capacity of the Krakovets’-Korczowa checkpoint has been increased by 50 percent. This will significantly increase the export-import flow across the border. Modernization awaits other checkpoints on the borders with the European Union. And it is tangible, and not only for us. Allows doing global things. Fighting the food crisis provoked by Russia's blockade of ports. I spoke about it in an address to the leaders of the African Union. I stressed that this crisis is artificial - it would not exist if it was not for the Russian war against us. I also stressed that we can ensure the supply of agricultural products in the amount that will definitely guarantee the security of Africa, the security of Asia. In general, we are expanding the capabilities of our state. Like all powerful European countries, we need our own policies towards Africa, Latin America, South-East Asia and other parts of the world that were previously left out of proper attention of Ukraine's foreign policy. We are working on the agency of Ukraine. I also addressed the participants of the Global Policy Forum in Italy. Very influential meeting. I talked about how to bring all Ukrainian migrants home. Today I met with Ben Stiller, a well-known actor and UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador who is engaged in providing assistance to displaced persons and refugees. I am grateful to Ben for his constant attention to the needs of Ukrainians. I met with President of the General Confederation of Italian Industry Carlo Bonomi. We talked about the ties between Ukrainian and Italian business. I am grateful for the opening of the Confederation's office in Kyiv. And the shortest, but very important address was made to the participants of the International Festival of Creativity in Cannes - the largest such event in the world. The Cannes Lions is a special audience. These are people who know how to control attention and who are very much needed in Ukraine right now. The longer the war lasts, the harder it is to compete for the attention of hundreds of millions of people in different countries. But I will do everything possible so that attention to Ukraine does not fade. I called on the most creative people in the world to be our allies in this. And I know that the response in Cannes was very positive. The next days of the week will also be busy. We are moving towards the main decision of the European Council, which will be adopted on Friday. As I predicted, Russia is very nervous about our activity. Again shelling of Kharkiv, Odesa, again attempts of brutal offensive actions in Donbas. This is an evil that can only be appeased on the battlefield. We are defending Lysychansk and Severodonetsk. This whole region is the most difficult, there are the hardest battles. But our strong boys and girls are there. The occupiers receive responses to their actions against us. I am grateful to the army and intelligence that provide it. In the evening I signed another decree on awarding our defenders. 220 combatants were awarded state awards. 27 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all who defend our state! Glory to you! Glory to Ukraine!"
Kyrylo Tymoshenko met with the President of the Austrian Association of Municipalities,2022-06-20T21:44:00Z,"Pursuant to the instruction of Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak, Deputy Head of the Office of the President Kyrylo Tymoshenko met with President of the Austrian Association of Municipalities Alfred Riedl. Kyrylo Tymoshenko noted that Ukraine is currently going through difficult times, as even in the territories de-occupied from Russian troops, road and social infrastructure, as well as people's homes have been destroyed. According to him, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is implementing an ambitious plan to rebuild Ukraine: he is negotiating at the highest level with the leaders of the partner countries on the patronage over each region. At the same time, the Office of the Head of State seeks to build cooperation with foreign communities at the local level to restore specific facilities. Kyrylo Tymoshenko noted that Austrian communities could establish partnerships with certain communities of Ukraine and in the framework of this cooperation take part in the reconstruction of a kindergarten, school, sports ground, park, etc. ""We want the majority of Austrian communities to establish bilateral relations with Ukrainian communities, such as those that already exist between the Kyiv region and Lower Austria, as well as Zakarpattia and Burgenland,"" said the Deputy Head of the Office of the President. He said that in the framework of a partnership memorandum between the Kyiv region and Lower Austria, the town of Vösendorf is ready to help rebuild Bucha, and the mayor of Wiener Neustadt (near Vienna) expressed readiness to help rebuild Borodyanka. According to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, work is underway to create a so-called fast recovery plan - a plan to quickly rebuild apartments, schools, kindergartens, and medical facilities that were destroyed as a result of the Russian invasion. ""The first thing the President and our team want to do is create all the conditions for people to return home,"" he said. Kyrylo Tymoshenko also spoke about the development of an online resource that will display each destroyed or damaged infrastructure object - with photos and detailed information about it. It will soon be publicly available so that partners can begin work on these facilities. According to the Deputy Head of the Office of the President, the reconstruction of the facilities can be financed with the help of the United24 fundraising platform. Therefore, Kyrylo Tymoshenko noted, the leadership of the Austrian community will be able to demonstrate the practical results of its support for Ukraine through completed facilities. The Deputy Head of the Office of the President also stressed the importance of demining cities and territories liberated from the occupiers, especially residential buildings and roads. According to him, the areas that need demining today are so large that it will be difficult for Ukraine to cope alone. The parties discussed the need of employees of the SES of Ukraine for a protective uniform, as it is quickly wearing out, and equipment, including vehicles that could be used for demining. Alfred Riedl expressed readiness to help in this matter. The President of the Austrian Association of Municipalities noted his interest in finding ways to establish partnerships between local governments of Ukraine and Austria in the context of reconstruction. He stressed that Austrian cities and municipalities want to deepen cooperation with Ukrainian communities. ""The Austrian Association of Municipalities has prepared five vehicles for the transfer to Ukraine: three fire trucks, an ambulance and a garbage truck. This is a signal of the beginning of our cooperation,"" Alfred Riedl said. He also spoke about the European Investment Bank's infrastructure recovery programs. Separately, the President of the Austrian Association of Municipalities noted the Ukrainian system of online education, which he could observe at the example of families from Ukraine who took refuge in Vienna after the beginning of the war. ""We understand that Ukraine is currently fighting and suffering for European values, and therefore, of course, we, for our part, support granting Ukraine the status of a candidate for EU membership,"" said Alfred Riedl. As a result of the negotiations, the parties agreed to establish communication at the community level for a more substantive discussion of specific projects."
"President met with Hollywood actor, UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador Ben Stiller",2022-06-20T20:42:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Hollywood actor, director, screenwriter and producer Ben Stiller, who is visiting Ukraine as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador. Ben Stiller and UNHCR Representative in Ukraine Karolina Lindholm Billing visited the Office of the President after a visit to the occupied settlements of the Kyiv region. Today, they visited, in particular, the ruined residential areas of Irpin, where they talked to people who survived the occupation. ""It's one thing to see this destruction on TV or on social networks. Another thing is to see it all with your own eyes. That's a lot more shocking,"" said Ben Stiller ""What you saw in Irpin is definitely dreadful. But it is even worse to just imagine what is happening in the settlements that are still under temporary occupation in the east,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in response. The President and the UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador discussed the needs of temporarily displaced persons in Ukraine, as well as those in Poland, which Ben Stiller visited the day before. Separately, the Head of State emphasized the violation of the rights of Ukrainians forcibly deported to Russia, including children. Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the UNHCR delegation discussed ways of further cooperation of the Ukrainian authorities with UNHCR."
President discussed with the President of the General Confederation of Italian Industry the increase in the presence of Italian business and participation in the reconstruction of Ukraine,2022-06-20T20:21:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with President of the General Confederation of Italian Industry Carlo Bonomi. The President of Ukraine expressed gratitude to Italy and personally to Prime Minister Mario Draghi for his active support of Ukraine, including the future membership of our country in the EU. ""Right now we are opening a new page in relations between our states,"" the President said. An important manifestation of such support is the establishment of a confederation's office in Ukraine. ""The opening of the confederation’s office in Kyiv right now is a landmark event and a powerful signal to all foreign investors,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The President noted the interest of the Ukrainian side in strengthening cooperation with Italian business and well-known companies that could help restore and modernize the economy of our country. In his opinion, Ukraine and Italy have common values and developed social contacts. This creates an atmosphere of trust as a basis for further development of bilateral cooperation. Inviting the confederation to join the implementation of the large-scale Recovery Plan of Ukraine, the President expressed interest in the participation of Italian companies in the implementation of projects to rebuild the destroyed infrastructure, social facilities and housing. The parties separately discussed areas of future cooperation in which the Italian side has extensive experience and world-class expertise. ""The help of the confederation in starting production on the territory of Ukraine, creating new jobs is extremely important for the employment of Ukrainians who lost their jobs as a result of hostilities,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized."
"In an interview with The Economist, the First Lady warned the world against viewing Russia's aggression against Ukraine solely as a problem of Ukrainians",2022-06-20T19:11:00Z,"The First Lady of Ukraine Olena Zelenska gave an interview to The Economist. The President's wife warned the world against viewing Russia's aggression against Ukraine solely as a Ukrainian problem. ""Mariupol and Bucha are possible in any country at any moment. We thought that in the XXI century, all people in Europe have the same values. But it turned out that aggressors and war criminals still live next to civilized nations,"" she said."
"By providing weapons, EU countries help Ukraine oust the aggressor from its land, not attack other states - Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-06-20T19:00:00Z,"By providing weapons to Ukraine, the countries of the European Union, in particular Italy, are strengthening the defense capabilities of the Ukrainian army and the ability of our state to oust the aggressor from its land. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the opening of the ISPI Global Policy Forum (Milan, Italy). ""Italy, you do not support the offensive of the Ukrainian army, you support the defense capabilities of our state. Wherever we attack is our land. We just want to drive the Russian army out of our independent land. We do not cross borders, we do not kill civilians, citizens of the Russian Federation, despite their position on this war. We are an adequate nation that strives for independence. Therefore, I urge you to continue to support us,"" the President said, answering questions from Forum participants. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that Ukrainians simply want to live in their country within internationally recognized borders, they do not need foreign territories. ""And we defend what is ours. We are very motivated people. In addition to our independence, home and family, we have values. We defend the values we share with Europeans - and this is the second motivation. And third, we want to show everyone that Ukraine is not afraid of even the world's second army. We show the example of an independent state and the example of the struggle of an independent people,"" the President said. The Head of State noted that the protection of common European values is a unifying factor for Ukrainians. ""The fact that we are heading to the European Union and may receive EU candidate status this week will only strengthen our forces,"" he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the European Union countries that are fighting against Russia politically, with sanctions, and supporting the Ukrainian army with weapons. According to the President, Ukraine is equal to other EU countries, and the European Union should do for it what it is doing now for its member states. ""And since we are today an outpost of protection of these values, probably it is necessary to do a little more for us than for other countries. Because it is more difficult for us now,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy added."
We need to do even more for Ukraine to win - speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the opening of the ISPI Global Policy Forum,2022-06-20T17:53:00Z,"Thank you very much! First of all, I would like to thank Mr. Giampiero Massolo. I would like to thank you, dear Mr. Mario Monti, for inviting me. Just before I start, I would like to thank you for our students, for finding opportunities, for finding programs, for helping Ukrainians, temporarily displaced persons, our displaced students. This is our future, so we do not want to lose it and therefore we really want them to return to our homeland after receiving your warmth, knowledge, experience. Thank you again for saving our future, our students. Now I would like to address all the participants of the forum. Dear friends! I am grateful for this opportunity to address you today. Everything needs to be done today. And so it happened that today is World Refugee Day. Unfortunately, this day has recently become especially painful for all of us, for millions of Ukrainians. To be precise, for more than 12 million of our citizens. Imagine! Those who at the beginning of this year had a home, complete security, plans for the future. And all this was destroyed by the Russian invasion. More than 12 million Ukrainians have become migrants. They left their cities, communities and sought refuge in a safe area. Where at least Russian artillery does not reach. More than 5 million Ukrainians out of these 12 have left our country and found refuge in other countries, including Italy. I would like to thank once again all your people, your cities, your Government and Prime Minister Mr. Draghi for helping our people, especially our women and children. It is very important. But what is our goal now? What do I want to say today? We must do everything we can to ensure that Ukrainian migrants return home. No matter how many of them there are and wherever they seek protection, we must provide them with a real opportunity and internal interest to return to Ukraine. We can set a historical precedent. Earlier, when the aggressor started a war against another state, he hoped that the war would break the victim. And now we have proved that Ukraine cannot be broken. But this is not enough. That is why this is a key element - the ability of people to return home. Due to the Russian war against Ukraine, Europe is experiencing the biggest migrant crisis in decades. When else was it that 12 million people lost their home and security in just a few months? Only World War II comes to mind. Russia has deliberately created such conditions. Mariupol – almost half a million inhabitants. Different cities. Severodonetsk – 100 thousand inhabitants. Volnovakha – 22 thousand inhabitants. So it was. But Russia destroyed everything there. Artillery, aircraft, missiles - they did not spare tools. I can name hundreds of other cities that have already been destroyed. And I can name dozens of other cities that are still threatened by Russian strikes. Now the Russian army is trying to gather forces to attack Kharkiv again. We de-occupied this region. And they want to do it again, and we see it. And there are one and a half million inhabitants. Mykolaiv is constantly being bombed, with almost half a million inhabitants. They want to capture and completely destroy Slovyansk - there were 100 thousand inhabitants before the war. Of course, we will do everything possible to stop the occupiers, to protect the people. But to do it faster, we need support, modern weapons. Such weapons, which have potential greater than that of the Russian army. That is why I spend so much emotion, so much time and so much effort to convince all our partners to give us powerful weapons. It's a matter of lives. The second point is the economy. And as long as the war continues, as long as Russian missiles hit our cities, normal economic life is simply impossible. Up to half of our entire economy, up to half of our economic system is not working now. Imagine what it would be like if half of Italy's economy was completely blocked. Its industrial part and all your ports. No state can survive such a situation without financial assistance. And when we say that Ukraine needs about $ 5 billion a month to cover the budget deficit, it's not just a number, it's not about money. It's about how many millions of Ukrainians will still have something to live for. Live in Ukraine. The third point is reconstruction. We must do absolutely everything so that after our victory - I have no doubt about it - we would be able not just to restore normal living conditions in the areas where the Russian occupiers tried to leave only scorched debris, but to build a life so modern, so safe that it would affect the aggressor as well. That is, not only sanctions, not only the physical losses of the Russian army on the battlefield, but also the very fact of restoring life in Ukraine. Life itself is a priority. The very fact that we can rise from the ashes. And the aggressor state will remain with losses and degradation only. Our goal is for this migrant crisis in Europe caused unconditionally and solely by the Russian war to be truly the last such crisis. So that any other aggressor does not even think that with the help of war it will be possible to destroy the life of any European country. Weapons for Ukraine, financial support, the future reconstruction of our state - these are three elements that must work to the fullest. But that's not all we have to do. The Russian war against us has provoked a global food crisis. If it is not stopped immediately, our 12 million forcibly displaced persons will simply be a drop in the ocean of possible new migration flows. Before this speech, I have just addressed the representatives of the African Union - and I have placed an emphasis on this. On food security. Ukraine can supply food to the world market in the amount to meet the critical needs of dozens of countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Without our exports, there is a deficit, which can lead to chaos. Political chaos, economic chaos, migration chaos. And only this year we can do everything so that on the next World Refugee Day we will not have to discuss how to cope with tens of millions of migrants in Europe and in the regions bordering Europe. Ladies and Gentlemen! It is a special moment now. A moment when the fate of millions of people depends on the decisions of European and world politicians. The moment when it is being decided whether peace will come to Ukraine soon. Therefore, it is being decided whether we will soon be able to say that we are already solving the problems I talked about today. And I urge you - be active! I am grateful to Italy for its principled position. But we need to do even more for Ukraine to win. I repeat - weapons for Ukraine, financial support and reconstruction of our state. Three elements that can change everything. Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!"
"In order to eliminate the threat of famine, Russia's efforts to return to the aggressive policy of colonialism must end – speech by the President of Ukraine at the session of the Bureau of the Assembly of the African Union",2022-06-20T16:57:00Z,"Dear Mr. Chairperson of the African Union, Dear Mr. Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Distinguished heads of state and government, Ladies and Gentlemen! Thank you for this opportunity to address you. Address you in a state of emergency, when we have a war. In an emergency for the whole world, when Africa is actually taken hostage. Hostage of those who started the war against our state. Yes, this is war. Russia's war against Ukraine. Not a crisis, not a conflict, as it is still defined sometimes. No, this is a war! A brutal war, a war of invasion. Russian troops have come to our land and want to conquer our people. This war may seem very distant to you and your countries. But catastrophically rising food prices have already brought it home to millions of African families. As well as to many families in Asia, Europe, Latin America. The unjust and provoked by the Russian war level of food prices is painfully felt on all continents. Unfortunately, this can become a particular problem for your countries. We need to take into account various factors - population growth on the African continent, the ongoing economic recovery after the pandemic, the lack of domestic financial resources in many countries to buy food at much higher prices. Given the physical shortage in the global market, some countries on the African continent find it particularly difficult to maintain the necessary food supplies. But why and when did this problem arise? I emphasize that such a problem did not exist on February 23 this year. It is true that unusual inflationary processes have already taken place in different parts of the world. Various countries have already sent huge sums of money to support the economy in the crisis through COVID-19. However, there was nothing like a food shortage. The crisis began on February 24, when the Russian fleet blocked Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. The sea route is the main one for the agrarian sector of our state. And Ukrainian agricultural exports are one of the foundations of the stability of the global food market. Ukraine is one of the main suppliers of wheat, sunflower oil and corn. According to expert estimates, the lives of about four hundred million people in different countries of the world depend on the export of our food. And if it was not for the Russian war against Ukraine, there simply would be no shortage in the food market. If it was not for the Russian war, our farmers and agricultural companies could have ensured record harvests this year. If it was not for the Russian war, people in Africa, people in Asia and anywhere else in the world would not suffer from the catastrophic rise in food prices. There simply would not be such a catastrophic rise in prices. Ladies and Gentlemen! This situation shows how connected everything is in the world. One war in Europe, namely Russia's attempt to seize our land, to turn Ukraine into a Russian colony, has led to a deterioration in access to food and a growing threat of famine everywhere. Of course, we are defending ourselves, of course, we will defend our independence until we win this war. And, of course, we are already trying to build new supply logistics. Right now we have more than 25 million tons of grain in the elevators awaited by traditional consumers of Ukrainian products. We are establishing exports by rail and through the ports of neighboring countries, so that last year's harvest and this year's harvest could reach consumers. But much smaller volume can be supplied via new routes, and it takes much more time. This results in a much more expensive supply. We are holding complex multilevel negotiations to unblock our Ukrainian ports. But you see that there is no progress yet. Because no real tool has yet been found to ensure that Russia does not attack them again. That is why the food crisis in the world will continue as long as this colonizing war continues, Russia's war against our state, and as long as our ports are blocked. Ukraine was also one of the main European producers of fertilizers. And now production is virtually stopped - again because of the war. Some manufacturers do not have the raw materials and even the ability to work - due to the threat of Russian missile strikes and other consequences of hostilities. Some companies are already in combat zones and were simply destroyed by Russian troops. Have you heard about this from your Russian partners with whom you maintain contact? Did they tell you that? I'm sure they're telling you completely different things. But, in fact, they need this crisis. They are deliberately exacerbating it. Because they are trying to use you and the suffering of the people to put pressure on the democracies that have imposed sanctions on Russia. I emphasize that the sanctions policy is aimed only to stop Russia from trying to turn Ukraine into its slave. Ladies and Gentlemen! We all see that the existing architecture of global security and international organizations are not yet able to influence the aggressor state to end this war and restore international security. Did the UN Security Council work? No. Moreover, your voice in the UN Security Council - the voice of Africa - has not been fully heard. But in today's globalized world, a world without Africa and Africa without ties with the world are impossible. And it is right that the African Union conducts a principled activity, defending the interests of all the inhabitants of your continent. However, your voice should be strong enough in all international structures. And if they need to be reformed for that, including the UN Security Council, then we need to do so. That is why, for example, on April 5, in my address to the UN Security Council, I proposed to convene in Kyiv - of course, after this war and our victory - a global conference on UN reform and transformation. I also launched a new policy of Ukraine towards Africa. It was during my term that the first Strategy for the Development of Ukraine's Relations with African States was approved. Dialogue with all countries of the continent will be intensified. The Special Representative of Ukraine for African Affairs will also start working in the near future. I want us to fully understand one another and interact without intermediaries - for our common interests. And the fact that there are such interests is quite obvious after February 24. Because the stability of your countries depends on the stability in Ukraine and in our region. Pursuant to my instruction, the first regional tour of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine to the states of Sub-Saharan Africa is being prepared. Of course, we also need to develop inter-parliamentary dialogue. To this end, I am initiating visits to African countries by representatives of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. I invite you to visit our country now to renew our bilateral ties. And I propose to start preparing, with our common willingness, a large political and economic conference ""Ukraine - Africa"". In many countries of the African Union, Ukraine is well known economically and in the educational sphere. In fact, our relationship is very old. Our specialists have been building enterprises in your countries in Soviet times. Your students have studied at our universities and are studying now. We have always contributed to the maintenance of peace on the African continent. Until February 24, more than 300 Ukrainian blue helmets performed tasks within six UN missions. And our national contingent, including the 18th Separate Helicopter Detachment, was an important part of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. And it is on this basis of the relationship that has existed for many, many years that we must build a new political history. We can do it. We must free our people from the threats artificially created for us by any states that simply want to conquer us, use our resources and our land. And our number one task now is to finally get rid of the threat of famine. In the XXI century, such a threat simply cannot exist - thanks to Ukraine, thanks to our agricultural sector. We cover any deficits, we produce everything so that there is enough food for each of your countries, all consumers with whom we work. If it wasn't for the Russian war, you would be in a completely different position now - completely safe. That is why, in order to avoid famine, the efforts of states like Russia to return to the aggressive policy of colonialism must end. The time of empires is over! People have the right to just live, just live and have everything for life. Thank you very much for this opportunity to address you! Thank you very much for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!"
The Three Seas Initiative needs the potential of Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the participants of the Three Seas Initiative Summit,2022-06-20T16:16:00Z,"Thank you so much, Mr. President! Thank you for all the kind words in support of Ukraine! For what has just been said, for what you and our friends have done for the strength of our state! Dear colleagues, friends! Ladies and Gentlemen! I am also grateful for the invitation, Mr. President Levits! I am grateful to you and I have the honor to address all present today. I will begin my address immediately with the key thing, given our precious time. I'll start with what we offer. First, Ukraine must be a participant in the Three Seas Initiative. It is wrong that our state remained outside the Initiative. We need to find a format in which we can implement the accession. Just one look at the geographical map of our region is enough to understand that it is only with Ukraine that all our countries can realize their full potential. Economic, infrastructural, potential of social ties between our countries, between our people and the historical basis of life in our region. Based on this, my second suggestion is to strengthen the interpretation of cooperation in the framework of the Three Seas Initiative. Every sphere we can work on together in this Initiative is really about security. And first of all it is logistics. Please look at the Ukrainian situation now: it is the states of the Three Seas that are our connection to the free world. The supply of weapons to Ukraine, the supply of fuel, the preservation of vital transport flows, green corridors for the export of Ukrainian food, the migration of people - all this works through the territory of the member states of this Initiative. In the same way, the Three Seas Initiative is destined to become an effective rear for any country in our region, if it is also - God forbid, of course - threatened by Russia. When the enemy comes, everything matters: roads, railways, ports, the energy system, speed at the borders, even the habit of working together. That is why it is our duty to deepen all connections in this space. It is these connections that are our security, after all. The third proposal is energy. Ukraine has one of the most powerful gas storage facilities in the region and an extensive gas supply network. Therefore, by cooperating with our neighbors, using the capacities of the Poland-Slovakia, Poland-Ukraine interconnectors, as well as the LNG terminals available in the region, we can meet the needs of all the countries of the Three Seas Initiative. Already after the start of a full-scale Russian invasion, we joined the European Union's energy system. And now our electricity exports can be a contribution to the energy balance of your countries, which will help you become completely independent of Russian energy pressure. The fourth suggestion is that we must do everything we can to make the Trans-European Corridor Via Carpathia work one hundred percent, connecting northern and southern Europe. Ukraine can play the role of one of the logistics centers. And we are ready to join Via Carpathia right now. We are ready to integrate into the European railway network, in particular through the Warsaw-Kyiv railway line and access to the Rail Baltica railway corridor. We must continue to work on expanding checkpoints on the borders of our state. Fifth proposal - Ukraine can support many infrastructure projects in the field of digitization and strengthen our regional digital ties. Keep in mind that the Ukrainian experience in combating cyber threats is truly unique and can be very useful for each of your countries. And the sixth proposal - participation in the project of reconstruction of Ukraine. This will be the largest economic project of our generation. Politicians often say that economic prosperity is the foundation of national security. And it really is. But not as often as they say, politicians manage to implement this principle. That is to make the economy so powerful that the state itself becomes powerful enough. Now we have such a historic chance. But only if we work together will we be able to use it. The Three Seas Initiative needs the potential of Ukraine. We are ready. We are willing. For the first time, Ukraine has been invited to participate in the Three Seas Initiative Summit today. I am grateful. However, you know - while this war is going on, I can't leave the state. So I can't be with you right now. But I am sure that you can now involve us in specific infrastructure projects, and will find a status that will allow us to participate in the activities of your Initiative. I believe it is possible! Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!"
"Tomorrow a historic week begins, when we will hear the answer from the EU on the candidate status for Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-06-19T22:55:00Z,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! There were many congratulations in our country today. June 19 is Medical Workers' Day, Father's Day and Farmer's Day. Of course, today I would like to thank all our doctors, all Ukrainian nurses, who have been literally on the frontline since February 24. Thank you for the tens of thousands of second birthdays you gave to our military, our civilians, our Ukrainian children. Thank you for saving lives on the front, in hospitals across our country. Ukrainian doctors are countless examples of extraordinary heroism. Heroism of those who carried out surgeries under shelling. Who worked in the blockade in Mariupol. Who survived the occupation, captivity and even in such conditions, as much as possible, saved lives - the most precious thing. I would also like to thank our farmers today. Those who defended their communities even with bare hands when stopping the Russian military. Who, despite the war, ensured a sowing campaign. Those who were even nicknamed ""tractor troops"" when they were taking Russian trophy equipment from the battlefield. And now that Russia has blocked our exports through the Black Sea ports, the whole world has seen who Ukrainian farmers really are and what the work of our agricultural sector is worth. Of course, I would like to thank all the fathers in Ukraine. All those who raised their children as good, decent, brave people. People who defend the state and do everything to help their neighbors live through the war. The Ukrainian courage that inspires the world so much, the Ukrainian freedom that strengthens the whole of Europe are possible only because Ukrainian parents have raised such children. Children with an understanding of values, able to be true heroes. Tomorrow a truly historic week begins. A week when we will hear the answer from the European Union on the candidate status for Ukraine. We already have a positive decision from the European Commission, and at the end of the new week there will be a response from the European Council. I think it is obvious to everyone that since 1991 there have been few such fateful decisions for Ukraine as we expect now. And I am convinced that only a positive decision meets the interests of the whole of Europe. I will deliver new addresses this week, including to Europeans. I will take every opportunity to defend the European perspective for Ukraine, for each of us, and to gather new supporters for us. Obviously, we should expect greater hostile activity from Russia. Purposefully - demonstratively. This week exactly. And not only against Ukraine, but also against other European countries. We are preparing. We are ready. We warn partners. The occupiers are accumulating forces in the Kharkiv direction, in the Zaporizhzhia region. They struck at our fuel infrastructure again - they want to worsen the fuel situation. Of course, we will respond to this, too. Fierce fighting continues in Donbas. The Russian army uses the greatest number of artillery there, the greatest number of offensive forces. But Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Avdiivka, Krasnohorivka and other hot spots are holding on. Our people are like that. They are holding on. Our army is holding on. And I am grateful to everyone whose strength today means our victory tomorrow. Eternal glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Fights hard! Glory to Ukraine!"
"We will not give away the south to anyone, we will return everything that’s ours and the sea will be Ukrainian - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-06-19T05:56:00Z,"Good health to you! Nightly, almost morning report. I am coming back from the south - visited today our frontline positions in the Mykolaiv region, visited Mykolaiv itself, and the Odesa region as well. I talked to our defenders - military, police, National Guard, territorial defense. Their mood is confident, and looking into their eyes it is obvious that they all do not doubt our victory. Thanked them for the service, for the protection of our state. Thanked the parents of such brave children. Really very strong. Presented awards to the best. Presented the Order of the Golden Star to the Hero of Ukraine Colonel Vadym Sukharevsky, commander of the 59th separate motorized infantry brigade. We will not give away the south to anyone, we will return everything that's ours and the sea will be Ukrainian and safe. Both in Mykolaiv, and in Odesa I held meetings with our military, with all officials who are responsible for defense and maintenance of these two regions. Listened to the reports on the destruction of the regions caused by Russian strikes. The losses are significant. Many houses were destroyed, civilian logistics were disrupted, there are many social issues. I have commissioned to make assistance to people who have lost loved ones more systemic. We will definitely restore everything that was destroyed. Russia does not have as many missiles as our people have the desire to live. Substantively discussed the economic situation, the work of the agricultural sector. Discussed the security of our ports and opportunities for the export of our agricultural products. Our position is clear and unchanged - as soon as we can ensure security through international mediation, Ukraine will do everything possible to counter the food crisis that broke out across the world – in Asia, Africa and most countries of the world – due to the Russian war. I visited city hospitals in Mykolaiv and Odesa. I thanked the doctors and nurses - they are our heroes. On the eve of the Medical Workers' Day, I congratulated them on their professional holiday. I had a conversation with our defenders wounded in battles. Yesterday I signed a decree conferring the rank of Major General upon the Commander of the Medical Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Tetyana Ostashchenko. Today I had the honor to personally congratulate Tetyana Mykolaivna on this rank. And I always say in my appeals on purpose – male and female defenders. I want all of us in Ukraine to always emphasize the contribution of both men and women to the defense of our state. My main impressions today are absolute pride in our people. I am proud of all those who defend the state! I am grateful to everyone who saves people! Glory to Ukraine!"

The President's wife also informed about the program of psychological support for the citizens of Ukraine, launched at her initiative: ""Ukrainians are not used to seeking help from psychologists. We tend to ignore depression or anxiety. But now we all need to reconsider these stereotypes. And it will take a big information campaign to prove to people that it is not their fault that they need psychological help now. It is necessary to apply for it and there is a place to apply to."""

We managed to liberate Ukrainian paramedic Yulia “Tayra” Payevska from captivity – address by the President of Ukraine,2022-06-17T21:32:00Z,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! We are now one step from the beginning of full-fledged integration with the European Union. We have a positive conclusion from the European Commission on the candidacy for Ukraine. And this is a historical achievement of all those who work for our state. The only thing left is to wait for the decision of the European Council next week. And I believe that Ukraine has done everything possible for this step to be positive as well – the decision of the European Council, i.e. the leaders of the EU states. Ukraine deserves this positive. Ukrainian values are European values. Ukrainian institutions maintain resilience even in conditions of war. Ukrainian democratic habits have not lost their power even now. And our rapprochement with the European Union is not only positive for us. This is the greatest contribution to the future of Europe in many years. Let me remind you now only one thing: after February 24, our country acceded to the European energy system. Our networks - Ukraine and the European Union - work in sync despite a full-scale war. Hence, even this fact alone shows everything at once - the professionalism of our people, the strength of our institutions, our ability to fulfill promises and the magnitude of Ukraine's potential. And I want to emphasize that Ukraine's European integration is not something purely political, not something detached from the lives of ordinary people. On the contrary. The closer we are to other European countries, the more opportunities we will have to guarantee all Ukrainians a modern and prosperous life. I spoke today with Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission. I thanked her and all members of the European Commission for their leadership and today's decision. I also spoke with European Council President Charles Michel. We are coordinating our steps. And I am grateful to Charles for feeling the historical significance of these processes for both Ukraine and the future of Europe. Today I will also speak with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Rutte. I use every opportunity for our interests, for Ukraine. During yesterday's visit to Kyiv by the leaders of France, Germany, Romania and Italy, it was clear what far-reaching prospects are being opened both for our country and for all Europeans if we continue to work together. And today this understanding has become even clearer. European strength, European independence and European development can be imagined truly powerful only with Ukraine. It is interesting, by the way, how the course of history chooses the time for important decisions: the government of Ukraine abolished the agreement on visa-free regime with the Russian Federation today. Now the visa regime will be effective starting from July 1. It is difficult to overestimate the symbolism of what happened today. But no one picked the moment on purpose. This is what the course of history is. Russia itself has done everything to destroy any ties with Ukraine. Well, we are doing everything to make our ties with Europe as strong as possible. Boris Johnson visited Kyiv today. This is already the second visit of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to our capital since February 24. The negotiations are positive. We discussed the situation on the frontline and ways to achieve our victory. I am grateful to Boris for his leadership in supporting Ukraine, including with weapons. I am also grateful that we equally perceive the need for unconditional protection of our state. We talked about security guarantees for Ukraine. When we define the parameters of these guarantees, they will determine the future of Ukrainians and all Europeans for generations to come. In general, the week was maximally useful for Ukraine – in many areas. And I would also like to thank US President Biden today for increasing American support for Ukraine every week. And this week we have significant results on the front exactly due to the support of the United States. I have just signed new decrees on awarding our heroes. 413 combatants were awarded state awards, 29 of them posthumously. And finally. Today I can already announce this: we managed to liberate “Tayra”, Ukrainian paramedic Yulia Payevska, from captivity. I am grateful to everyone who worked for this result. ""Tayra"" is already home. We will keep working to liberate everyone. Eternal glory to all who stood up for our independence and our freedom! Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

President of Ukraine met with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in Kyiv for the second time during a full-scale war,2022-06-17T18:14:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson, who is on a visit to our country. The Ukrainian Head of State noted that this was the second visit of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to Kyiv since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation. ""I am very grateful to you for such attention to our nation, to all our people, to our state. And for Britain's leadership and unprecedented support for Ukraine,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy, addressing Boris Johnson during a joint statement to the media following the negotiations in Kyiv. According to the President of Ukraine, the talks were as substantive as possible, filled with important details. Among the key issues are bilateral relations and the overall situation in Europe and the world. ""First of all, these are two important things - defense and security. We discussed in detail the current situation on the frontline, in our east, in the south of our state, our capabilities in defending Ukraine from the Russian occupiers. We have a common view on how to move towards victory. Because this is exactly the result that Ukraine needs - the victory of our state,"" he stressed. Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom for understanding the armed needs of our country. ""In particular, we talked about the need to increase the supply of heavy weapons. The main thing today is to provide air defense for Ukraine as well. We started to move in this direction. Russian missiles remain a threat to our people, to the entire territory of Ukraine. The vast majority of Russian missile strikes are conducted by the Russian army against ordinary people, civilian infrastructure - housing, schools, hospitals, universities, transport. Obviously, this should be one of the priorities for all of us, for our partners - to help protect against Russian missiles. It will be a guarantee of life for people in most of our territory,"" the President said. Also, according to him, during the talks the parties touched upon the results of the third meeting in the Rammstein format, where Great Britain facilitated the interests of Ukraine. In addition, the interlocutors discussed the need of our state for financial and economic support. ""It's not just finances, we also have a fuel shortage due to the bombing of our refinery, our reserves by the Russian Federation. We also talked about a difficult issue - ensuring preparation for the heating season. I am grateful to Boris for his readiness to help our state,"" the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Boris Johnson raised the issue of increasing sanctions pressure on the Russian Federation. ""I thanked Boris for his personal integrity and leadership in this direction. We also shared our suggestions. We can make sanctions tangible, so that Russia really feels that its aggression, its terrorist actions against Ukraine and against global stability will lead to losses for Russia itself - the aggressor must pay the highest price for this aggression, for this war,"" the President said, adding that Russia must also compensate for all the losses of people, communities and businesses. In addition, he believes that Russia must bear responsibility for the food crisis it provoked and the food shortage on the world market, which arose due to the Russian blockade of Ukrainian ports. The parties also continued to work out security guarantees for Ukraine, which can bring stability not only to our country, but also to Europe and the world. ""Of course, we have to increase our cooperation for demining the territory of Ukraine. We started a detailed discussion of this issue. And we are preparing to fill the process of rebuilding our state with practical steps. We have no doubt that we will win, so we are already preparing to rebuild the country after our victory. Again, I am thankful for the patronage over Kyiv and the Kyiv region undertaken by Great Britain,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. For his part, Boris Johnson noted the heroism of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, their courage and bravery. He expressed understanding of the impossibility of any compromise between the Ukrainian people and Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""Ukraine is suffering, the Ukrainian military is suffering, but there are all signs and evidence that Russian troops are under significant pressure, suffering heavy losses, and spending their weapons enormously. In 114 days of the attack on Ukraine, they have not yet achieved the objectives they've set for themselves for the first week,"" said the Prime Minister. According to him, Great Britain wants to provide Ukraine with strategic endurance, so it will strengthen the world diplomatic coalition in support of our state and work on strengthening sanctions against the regime of Vladimir Putin. ""I understand the need to continue financial support for Ukraine, to unblock grain exports that Putin has held hostage in an attempt to deprive the world of food,"" said Boris Johnson. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom assured that his country is ready to continue providing weapons to Ukraine and organizing military training for its use. ""Due to this, the Ukrainian people and the Armed Forces of Ukraine will be able to do what Ukrainians really want to do, namely, drive the aggressor out of Ukraine,"" Boris Johnson summed up."
Ihor Zhovkva had a phone conversation with the European Policy Advisor to the Federal Chancellor of Germany,2022-06-17T16:27:00Z,"Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Ihor Zhovkva had a phone conversation with European Policy Advisor to the Federal Chancellor of Germany Undine Ruge. Ihor Zhovkva thanked the German side for the strong political support shown by Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz during his visit to Ukraine on Thursday. The Deputy Head of the Office of the President emphasized the importance of Germany's support for granting Ukraine the status of a candidate for accession to the European Union. Ihor Zhovkva expressed hope that such a clear leadership position of Germany will contribute to achieving unity within the EU on a positive decision in favor of Ukraine as a candidate country for membership in the European Union during the European Council session on June 23-24 this year. ""Ukraine and the Ukrainian people deserve this decision,"" he said. ""The decision to grant our country candidate status will be deeply symbolic for Ukrainians as a manifestation of European solidarity. It will also be important in practice as a powerful impetus for further reforms. We understand that there is still a lot of work ahead, but we are ready to follow the recommendations and ask to treat Ukraine in view of our achievements,"" Ihor Zhovkva added. The Deputy Head of the Office of the President thanked the German side for supporting the introduction of the sixth package of EU sanctions against Russia and called for further strengthening of sanctions pressure. ""The next package should include new sanctions in the fields of energy, finance and trade, new personal sanctions against Russian oligarchs, government officials and heads of state-owned enterprises, as well as measures to close all opportunities to circumvent and evade sanctions,"" he said."
Both Ukraine and the Western Balkans are equally interested in a united Europe - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's address to the participants of the Prespa Forum Dialogue,2022-06-17T09:45:00Z,"Dear Mr. President Pendarovski, Dear Presidents, Prime Ministers, Parliamentarians! Dear attendees! Friends! I am grateful for the opportunity to address you and leave my arguments for discussion at your important Forum. Now is a historic moment for Europe and European security, when everyone has to decide: what Europe is and what Europe will be like in the future. Will it be as free as it is now? Will it be as safe as most Europeans are used to? Will it be as socially and economically developed, inspiring societies outside Europe to change their way of life? Russia has challenged us all - every nation on the continent, every region of Europe. For Ukraine, this is the most dreadful military challenge, and we have been defending ourselves for 113 days already against Russia's ambition to destroy the Ukrainian people and our culture. Ukrainian cities destroyed by the Russian army; millions of migrants; hundreds of thousands of people deported by the Russian military; and tens of thousands of Ukrainians killed are all blatant manifestations of Russia's anti-European policy. By starting this war against Ukraine, Russia tried to create a springboard for an attack on other nations of Europe. That is why our defense in this war and our future victory are fundamentally important for the security of everyone in Europe. But in addition to this blatant manifestation of Russia's anti-European policy, there are many other manifestations of it. Smaller, but still very vile and destructive, openly aggressive. And I would like to draw your attention to the fact that today there is not a single country left in Europe that has not suffered from at least one of the many manifestations of Russia's anti-European policy. Ladies and Gentlemen! All of us in a democratic world have faced an unprecedented energy crisis. For many years, Russia has been creating the impression that it is allegedly a reliable supplier of energy resources. But in reality it managed to make different European countries dependent on it. And now, when Russia decided to wage a war to conquer European nations, it used this energy chain first. It specially provoked historically extremely high gas prices. It specially restricts gas supplies, blackmailing individual countries and Europe as a whole. It violates existing contracts – requires payment for gas in rubles and artificially limits the volume of supply. This pressure on the gas market, as well as the use of other instruments by Russia, has led to a significant acceleration of inflation. This simply would not be the case if Russia acted as a responsible supplier and did not want to create a crisis. An even worse scenario is being implemented in the food market. It provokes not only rising prices for basic foodstuffs, but also a new migrant crisis. Russia's blockade of Ukrainian ports and strikes at our agro-industrial infrastructure cause deficits in important regional segments of the world food market. Ukrainian wheat, corn, sunflower oil and other commodities have been indispensable for global food stability. Russia knew where to hit to create this crisis. And it deliberately increases it prolonging the war against our state and refusing to make the Black Sea safe for navigation. Why is it doing this? So that a new migrant wave hits, in particular, your countries, as well as your neighbors in Europe. How many millions of refugees will there be in Europe if Russian policy causes famine in African and Asian countries? And if the shortage of products there and the price crisis provoke political chaos and the fall of governments? Will you then be able to pursue a consolidated policy? That's why Russia wants a food crisis. And I will mention another element of Russia's anti-European policy. Russia is perhaps the world's largest investor in propaganda - and not just for domestic audience. Russia spends billions of dollars a year to deceive foreign audience and to incite hostility. And the connection between propaganda and war is obvious: in the first months of this year, Russia's propaganda budget was tripled. I am sure that each and every one of you knows what propaganda tools have worked or are still working against your states. And this instrument of Russia has only one task: to make it worse. In particular, worse for you. Ladies and Gentlemen! That is why any serious discussion of the security architecture in Europe must be based on the need to free Europe from the chains of dependence that the Russian state has been creating for decades. Security is simply impossible without it, and it is the same for the north of Europe, for the south, for the west and for the east. That is why such sanctions are needed for anti-European policy of Russia, so that they will forever remember the price, including for the food crisis. The one who creates artificial famine must become a global outcast and suffer painful losses. This should be taken into account in the preparation of the seventh EU sanctions package. And we need to realize that sanctions packages have, in fact, become part of the continent's security architecture. They work for stability and peace - limiting Russia's ability to expand aggression. Europe's full energy independence is needed. Any ties with Russia that it uses to make money on Europe and pursue anti-European policy must be severed. There can be no trade with Russia - you should not give money to those who seek your destruction. And most importantly - we need to make the whole of Europe finally united. This is what Ukraine and your countries - the Western Balkans - are equally interested in. Full-fledged European integration of Ukraine, as well as full-fledged European integration of your states, is a historical strengthening of Europe and a complete dismantling of Russia's ability to beat us one by one. The EU-Western Balkans High Level Summit will take place shortly. I sincerely wish it will be successful for your states. And I am grateful to you for the support of Ukraine that you provide at various levels, so that this June will be successful for our country in relations with the EU. By answering us about our European perspective and by answering you about your European perspective, the nations of Europe and European politicians are answering questions about the future of Europe. These are the questions I voiced at the beginning of my address. What will Europe be like in the future? Will it be as free as it is now? Will it be as safe as most Europeans are used to? Will it be as socially and economically developed, inspiring societies outside Europe to change their way of life? We need a positive answer – to our and your European perspective. And I am grateful to you for working together on such an answer. I wish us all success! I wish us all victory! Glory to Ukraine!"
It was important to hear from the EU leaders that the end of the war and peace for Ukraine must be exactly as our people see them - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-06-16T22:17:00Z,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today is a truly historic day - Ukraine has felt the support of four powerful European states at once. And in particular support for our movement to the European Union. Italy, Romania, France and Germany are with us. All four leaders - Mr. Draghi, Mr. Iohannis, Mr. Macron and Mr. Scholz - support Ukraine's candidacy. Of course, all relevant procedures must be followed, and all EU member states must join. But at our meeting today a big step was made - a step forward. It was important for me to hear from the leaders another fundamental thing - they agree that the end of the war and peace for Ukraine must be exactly as Ukraine sees them. As our people see them. I am grateful to Italy for its principled political support, macro-financial and defense assistance. Historically we now have the best relations - and I am sure we can do a lot more for our nations. I am grateful to Romania for the defense assistance and assistance in the transit of our goods, including grain. We agreed to increase export capacity through the territory of Romania. France will provide additional Caesar artillery systems. This is very important for our defense. Also today, President Macron openly said that the European support for Ukraine should really demonstrate that we defend the same values, defend Europe together. Germany has confirmed the provision of air defense systems for our country and further support. By the way, when four leaders arrived in Kyiv today, it coincided with the beginning of the air raid siren. Russia has created a background for everyone to hear these sirens to create a tense atmosphere. But no one was scared, and it only inspired us to be as specific as possible and to negotiate for our interests - for all Ukrainians and for all in Europe. Today I personally thanked Chancellor Scholz for inviting me to the G7 meeting. In general, my impression of the meeting is positive. All leaders understand why negotiations to end the war are not under way. Exclusively because of Russia's position, which is only trying to intimidate everyone in Europe and continue the destruction of our state. They do not want to look for a way to peace. This is an aggressor who must decide for himself that the war must end. We will continue to fight until we guarantee our state full security and territorial integrity. We talked today about the preparation of a new sanctions package against Russia. We talked about overcoming the food crisis provoked by Russia. The resumption of exports of Ukrainian agricultural products is vital for dozens of countries. And there is only one reason why the food crisis has become possible at all: Russia is to blame, and no one else. All leaders already recognize this. We talked about the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war - we have very specific views of partners on this. I believe that it is not a coincidence that the situation with gas in Europe has worsened today - the price has jumped again. Russia has done this on purpose, restricting supplies to harm Europe, to strike at Europeans. Gazprom is simply pulling on the gas chain in which they have been trying to shackle Europe for a long time. And this is another argument in favor of the fact that Europe must now switch to life without Russian gas. There should be no such dependence. Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow there will also be a lot of news for Ukraine, and I believe that they will be positive. I really believe that. I would like to emphasize once again that all this is possible first of all thanks to our heroes, thanks to each and everyone who protects us from Russian troops. Today, the Ukrainian army is fighting in the conditions of a significant quantitative advantage of the enemy - in technology, in artillery systems. Fighting in such conditions is a daily feat. We do everything to give our heroes modern and powerful weapons. And I am proud of all those who have been repelling the occupier and all the attacks for 113 days of the full-scale war already. It is thanks to the bravery of Ukrainian men and women that Europe can create this new history of freedom and finally remove the ""gray"" zone between the EU and Russia in Eastern Europe. Ukraine has come closest to the European Union since independence. Eternal glory to all who are fighting for Ukraine! Eternal memory to all whose lives were taken by these occupiers! Glory to Ukraine!"
Granting Ukraine the status of a candidate for EU membership can be an important decision in the history of Europe - Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-06-16T20:32:00Z,"Granting Ukraine the status of a candidate for membership in the European Union can significantly strengthen freedom in Europe and become an important successful decision on its historical path. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a conversation with media representatives following a meeting with the Presidents of France and Romania, as well as the Prime Minister of Italy and the Chancellor of Germany in Kyiv. ""Russia wants to show that the European Union is allegedly incapable of being effective and that European values cannot protect freedom. We can and therefore must break this scenario jointly and prove to them that Europe will continue to be free, democratic and, I emphasize once again, this is important - united,"" said the President of Ukraine. According to him, the main manifestation of the common strong position of Europe can now be the support for Ukraine's integration into the EU. ""The very course of European history has proved the correctness of the European Union's positive response to Ukraine's aspirations. The status of a candidate for membership in the European Union for Ukraine can historically strengthen freedom in Europe and become one of the key European decisions of the first third of the XXI century,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The President stressed that Ukraine is ready to carry out the necessary work to gain full membership in the European Union. ""Ukrainians have already earned the right to take this path and receive candidate status. We have all seen polls that confirm that the majority in all European countries and on the European continent in general supports Ukraine's European integration. We have historically the highest level of support for European integration among the Ukrainian people as well,"" he said. For his part, President of the French Republic Emmanuel Macron noted that Ukraine is part of the European family, and the leaders of the four countries support granting Ukraine the status of a candidate for EU membership. He expressed hope that the decision to be taken at next week's European Council session would be unanimous. According to him, this status is tied to the roadmap, so Ukraine's European path is just beginning. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz stressed that the status of a candidate for EU membership is an important milestone on Ukraine's European path, and assured that he would stand for the given decision at a meeting of the European Council. He added that in order to join the European Union, candidates must meet certain criteria of a democratic and legal state. Romanian President Klaus Iohannis stressed that the European Union must create effective tools for rebuilding Ukraine. ""It is our duty to act. It is our responsibility not to miss this opportunity to help our Ukrainian friends gain a new future,"" said the President of Romania. Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi added that the EU demonstrates unity today and reaffirms readiness with its allies to help Ukraine. He also assured of the support for our country's European aspirations. ""Italy wants to see Ukraine as part of the European Union. This means it will unequivocally support Ukraine in its candidate status and in the future accession to the EU. This is a path that requires profound reforms,"" said Mario Draghi."
"Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with the leaders of Germany, France, Romania and Italy in Kyiv",2022-06-16T20:06:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with President of France Emmanuel Macron, Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz, President of Romania Klaus Iohannis and Prime Minister of Italy Mario Draghi, who arrived in Ukraine on a visit. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that the leaders of the four states first visited the city of Irpin in the Kyiv region, where they could see what the Russian occupiers had done on Ukrainian land. ""This visit of the four leaders to Kyiv and our negotiations have once again proved that our key strength and the most effective weapon is unification on which everything else depends,"" the Ukrainian Head of State said. According to the President of Ukraine, during the meeting in Kyiv, the leaders of the five states discussed steps to continue and strengthen the defense of our country; issues of economic support for Ukrainian citizens and post-war reconstruction; opportunities to counter the food crisis provoked by Russia; further sanctions pressure on Russia, as well as Ukraine's European integration. ""I informed the partners about the current situation on the front. About heroic defense in Donbas, situation in the Kharkiv region and in the south of our state. I also informed them about daily missile strikes. The total number of various Russian missiles used against Ukraine, against the civilian population may approach three thousand already this month,"" the President said. The President outlined Ukraine's priority needs in defense. ""We appreciate the support provided by partners. And we expect new supplies, especially heavy weapons, modern rocket artillery, missile defense systems and more. Each batch of such supplies means saved Ukrainians. And every day of delay or postponed decisions is an opportunity for the Russian military to kill Ukrainians and destroy our cities. There is a direct dependence: the more powerful weapons we get, the sooner we can liberate our people, our land,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. According to him, representatives of the international community are making many diplomatic efforts to restore peace in Ukraine, and everyone sees that ""the only obstacle to all these efforts is Russia's unwillingness to real negotiations and real action to restore peace."" The President noted that Russian troops continue a brutal offensive in Donbas, strengthen their group in the Kharkiv region, and reinforce bridgeheads in the south of Ukraine. ""The aggressor state must realize that there is no alternative to peace and must start looking for peace. Meanwhile, we all see - and heard today, when the air raid siren sounded - that Russia is only looking for new ways to intimidate Europe and seize more of our land,"" the President said. Therefore, according to the President, during the meeting in Kyiv the heads of state spoke about the new sanctions steps of the European Union needed to restore peace. ""The seventh sanctions package must be agreed upon,"" he said. In addition, the agenda of the talks between the leaders of the five states included work to compensate for all the losses caused by Russia to Ukraine, our citizens and businesses. ""We also paid attention to the ways to stop the global food crisis. Ukraine is doing everything possible to unblock our seaports, but this blockade must be lifted by the one who started it, namely the Russian Federation, and more specifically the Russian fleet. We are also grateful to Romania for its assistance in the transit of Ukrainian goods, including grain, through the Danube River. We discussed in detail with the present leaders how to increase these capabilities,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. ""I am confident that this visit of our friends to Kyiv will go down in the history of our country and Europe,"" he added. For his part, French President Emmanuel Macron said that from the first days of the war, Europe had sided with a free, sovereign Ukraine and defended the principles of international law that Russia had decided to ignore. ""We will never accept the choice in favor of war, destruction and chaos, in favor of armed aggression against a sovereign state and the conquest of a free people,"" he said. According to the leader of the French Republic, the countries of the European Union have already provided Ukraine with economic, humanitarian and military support and will intensify it. ""I would like to convey a message from all of us: Europe stands side by side with Ukraine until victory, and the face of this victory is a free, independent, peaceful Ukraine,"" said the French President. Emmanuel Macron stressed that it is Ukraine that will decide when and under what conditions it will sit down at the negotiating table with the Russian side to end the war. He noted that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was doing everything possible to preserve peace in Ukraine. According to him, the French Republic will strengthen military support for Ukraine. In particular, in the coming weeks, decisions will be made to provide additional CAESAR self-propelled howitzers, which will allow the Ukrainian soldiers to defend against the attacks by the Russian army more effectively. Emmanuel Macron also noted that France has sent its experts to Ukraine to help document and investigate war crimes committed by the Russian army on the Ukrainian territory. According to him, all these crimes must not go unpunished. In this context, the President of France said that Ukraine will soon be provided with a mobile laboratory for DNA analysis, which will help gather evidence. The leader of the French Republic also called for the adoption of a UN Security Council resolution on unblocking the Ukrainian ports. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz noted that the bravery of the Ukrainian military and citizens of Ukraine shown in the fight against the Russian invasion is admirable. ""Russia is forcibly trying to move borders inside Europe, and this is unacceptable. That is why Germany, along with other countries of the world, has sided with Ukraine since day one,” he said. The Chancellor stressed that Germany supports Ukraine in defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity. In particular, it provides significant financial assistance and has sheltered about 800,000 Ukrainian citizens. He also noted that Germany provides Ukraine with weapons and teaches the Ukrainian military to use modern weapons, self-propelled howitzers and anti-aircraft systems. ""We have also promised to provide IRIS systems that will protect entire cities from air raids. In addition, we have agreed with the United States and the United Kingdom that we will supply MLRS,"" Olaf Scholz said. Romanian President Klaus Iohannis stressed that his country stands in solidarity with Ukraine in the fight against the aggressor. He noted that Russia's aggression must be stopped and that all crimes committed by Russia must be investigated by international justice. Klaus Iohannis noted that his country is providing all the necessary assistance to Ukrainians who have been forced to flee their homes due to the war, and that Romanian society has mobilized its efforts to support them. In particular, a humanitarian hub has been set up in Suceava, which is now operating at full capacity. The President of Romania also stated that one of the elements of blackmail by Russia is the blockade of the export of Ukrainian grain. He stressed that the Black Sea port of Constanța and the port of the Danube River are being used for the transit of Ukrainian grain. In addition, the issues of opening a new crossing point on the Ukrainian-Romanian border and the use of other logistics routes for the transportation of grain from Ukraine are being considered. Prime Minister of Italy Mario Draghi underscored the support for the Ukrainian people, who have united and are fighting against Russian aggression. According to him, during the visit to Ukraine he saw the terrible consequences of the Russian occupation. Mario Draghi assured of his readiness to facilitate the investigations to document war crimes. The Prime Minister of Italy also noted that work will be continued to ensure the transportation of Ukrainian grain and avoid the food crisis. ""Unfortunately, Russia doesn't facilitate the resolution. We need to deal with this problem with the courage shown by President Zelenskyy. We must all act together,"" he said. ""We want peace, we want other cities not to be damaged. But Ukraine must defend itself to achieve peace. Peace must meet Ukraine’s expectations. It must be lasting,"" Mario Draghi summed up."
Olena Zelenska called on the EU to grant Ukraine status of a candidate for membership,2022-06-16T13:50:00Z,"First Lady of Ukraine Olena Zelenska spoke online at the international conference WomenNOW, which is taking place for the fourth time in the Spanish capital Madrid. The event is dedicated to leadership in volatile times, the power of change and the need for women to lead it. The President's wife thanked Spain for sheltering more than 100,000 Ukrainian temporary migrants. ""Imagine: Spain actually saved an entire city. Such as Severodonetsk, which the Russians are bombing at the moment we are talking. Spain receives our soldiers and children with oncology for treatment. Yes, you save lives! Ukrainians will not forget this,"" she said. Olena Zelenska also appealed to the representatives of the European Union to grant Ukraine the status of a candidate for membership: “On June 23-24, the European Council will consider granting Ukraine the status of a candidate for EU membership. This is what is now awaited in every trench and in every bomb shelter. To be invited to Europe no longer as refugees, but as like-minded people and allies. People who are now fighting not only for themselves, but also for the aggressor not to come to Europe. Someone will ask: what do we have to join the EU? I will say: we have the main thing - we value human life."" The conference was also attended by other female leaders, including Third Vice-President of the Government of Spain and Minister for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge Teresa Ribera, Economist and Professor at University College London Mariana Mazzucato, Director of Business Development at Santander Bank Cristina Alvarez, Paralympic Games contestant Sara Andres (Spain), former Vice President of the National Assembly of Afghanistan Fawzia Koofi."
"Every day we are fighting for Ukraine to receive the necessary weapons and equipment, but the courage, wisdom and tactical skills of our heroes cannot be imported - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-06-15T22:46:00Z,"Good health to you! The long and very busy day is over. Foreign policy has been a priority since the morning. In two vital areas at once - defense and Europe. I have just finished my conversation with Boris Johnson. Key topics were defense support and coordination of steps on the eve of important meetings in June. Today there is a lot of news about the third meeting in the ""Rammstein"" format. This is a format for the work of defense ministers of partner countries that determine the support packages for our country. And the news is really good. We expect an increase in this support.  By the way, we have another signal that defense support for Ukraine will be continued. As part of Rammstein, Britain and Denmark announced a special donors' conference in Copenhagen in August. 14 states are preliminary involved. I had an important conversation with US President Biden today. The United States has announced a new strengthening of our defense, a new $ 1 billion support package including coastal defense, artillery, modern rocket systems. We will be looking forward to it. I am grateful for this support, it is especially important for our defense in Donbas. I am also grateful for the leadership in mobilizing the help of all partners. There is also a new package of humanitarian support for Ukraine - a quarter of a billion US dollars. We also discussed with President Biden the tactical situation on the battlefield and ways to accelerate our victory. Sanctions, politics, economic cooperation - we are preparing for new steps. I was invited to speak at the NATO Summit in Madrid, as well as at the G7 meeting. In the afternoon there was a special summit with the leaders of the Western Balkans - the Prime Ministers of Montenegro and Albania came to Kyiv, and the Prime Minister of North Macedonia was present in a video format. Ukraine has received a significant decision by these countries to support the status of a candidate for EU membership for us - three countries have adopted such a joint statement. In fact, today we are as close to this status as we couldn't have dreamed of even a few years ago. Ukraine has done everything possible to obtain a candidacy. And today, in my address to the Parliament of the Czech Republic, I emphasized that the response to our candidacy will be the response of the European Union not only to Ukraine, but also to themselves - their future, the future of the European Union. Of course, the Russian state would not be itself if it simply watched our foreign policy success. Gas pressure on Europe is growing again. The shelling of Ukrainian positions and peaceful cities is intensifying again. Today they hit Mykolaiv, communities of the Dnipropetrovsk region, the Kharkiv region. Russian propagandists have become more active in producing fakes to provoke despair in Ukraine. But I do not believe that at least some of these fakes can work. We are defending Donbas. And, by the way, in all international contacts I hear admiration for the actions of our defenders. The world really wants to learn from Ukrainians how to fight and how to win. During the 112 days of this war, the Ukrainian army proved that courage and wisdom on the battlefield, together with the ability to tactically defeat the enemy, give significant results, even despite the significant advantage of the Russian army in the number of soldiers and equipment. Of course, we will do our best to outmatch their advantages for now. Every day I fight for Ukraine to get the necessary weapons and equipment. But courage, wisdom and tactical skills cannot be imported. Our heroes have it. I signed regular decrees awarding Ukrainian warriors. 284 servicemen were awarded state awards, 60 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Eternal glory to everyone who defends the state! Glory to Ukraine!"
Volodymyr Zelenskyy had a phone conversation with Joseph Biden,2022-06-15T21:55:00Z,"Another phone call took place between President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President of the United States Joseph Biden. The President of Ukraine thanked the President of the United States for the leadership position in supporting our country in countering the ongoing aggression by the Russian Federation, in our struggle for freedom and the right to determine our own future, and for consistent, unwavering support for Ukraine's independence and territorial integrity. The Head of State noted the importance and timeliness of the US provision of an additional package of assistance in the amount of USD 1 billion. ""The security support from the United States is unprecedented. It brings us closer to a common victory over the Russian aggressor,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, thanking Joseph Biden for his leadership in mobilizing international security support for Ukraine. During the conversation, Volodymyr Zelenskyy informed Joseph Biden of the latest developments on the frontline and informed about the priority needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to effectively counter Russian aggression. The importance of further coordination of the relevant efforts in the framework of the Rammstein format was emphasized. The interlocutors also discussed the importance of further economic and humanitarian support to Ukraine. ""We also appreciate the significant financial and macroeconomic support for Ukraine from the United States. It helps us endure this war,"" the President said. The President of Ukraine expressed special gratitude to Joseph Biden for the decision to allocate USD 225 million for the purpose of humanitarian aid to the population of our state affected by the Russian aggression. ""We must win this war and return our occupied territories. This will be our common victory,"" the President of Ukraine stressed."
"Albania, Montenegro and North Macedonia support Ukraine's course for full membership in the EU - Volodymyr Zelenskyy after meeting with the heads of governments of these countries",2022-06-15T18:53:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Prime Minister of Albania Edi Rama and Prime Minister of Montenegro Dritan Abazović, who are on a visit to our country. Also during the event, Prime Minister of North Macedonia Dimitar Kovačevski expressed his support for Ukraine in a video address. The President of Ukraine is convinced that the development of such a format of cooperation will strengthen our states, the region and Europe in general. ""This meeting of ours testifies to the support of the esteemed Prime Ministers and, consequently, the people of these states for Ukraine, our territorial integrity, sovereignty, our course for full membership in the European Union,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said during a conversation with media representatives following the negotiations in Kyiv. The President of Ukraine thanked the Prime Ministers of Albania, Montenegro and North Macedonia for the joint statement approved today following the talks in support of granting our country the status of a candidate for EU membership. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that the meeting took place on the eve of historically important international events, the decisions of which, in particular on granting EU candidate status to Ukraine, determine the fate of the European project and Europe as a whole. The Ukrainian President stressed that the strategic response to Russia's anti-European policy should be the strengthening of unification processes in Europe, greater coordination of European states, overcoming differences between the so-called old and new EU members, and eliminating any ""gray"" zones in Europe. ""Our states - Ukraine, the Republic of Albania, Montenegro and the Republic of North Macedonia - must become full members of the EU. And we agree that our countries are not competitors on this European path, they complement and strengthen each other's capabilities,"" he said. The parties also supported the need to bring to justice all Russian war criminals for what they had done against Ukraine and Europe. Prior to the meeting, the Prime Ministers of Albania and Montenegro visited the areas of the Kyiv region liberated from the Russian occupiers and saw for themselves the consequences of the actions of the Russian military in these territories. ""We agree that an effective tactical response to Russian aggression should be even greater assistance to Ukraine, timely assistance - this is very important. In particular, the assistance with weapons. Also - increasing pressure on Russia, increasing sanctions against Russia for this invasion. The seventh package of sanctions should be as tangible for the aggressor state as the previous six packages combined,"" the President of Ukraine stressed. Volodymyr Zelenskyiyy said that during the talks a lot of attention was paid to defense cooperation. He thanked for the practical assistance to Ukraine in the military-technical sphere, for the support of those Ukrainians who have found refuge in these countries. The Head of State also expressed hope that in the near future the four countries will be able to work together on a project of post-war reconstruction of Ukraine. Prime Minister of Albania Edi Rama stressed his support and solidarity with the Ukrainian people. He said that today he visited Irpin and Borodyanka affected by the occupation and offered his country's assistance in rebuilding houses in Irpin. ""I know that the EU, represented by many countries and regions, has joined this process, but we want to do it without unnecessary bureaucracy. Let us be the first, maybe it will speed up the accession of the rest,"" he added. Edi Rama also assured of support for Ukraine's aspirations to become a candidate for accession to the European Union. ""We do not want anyone to speculate on the fact that the EU is bypassing us and we are allegedly offended. This is not true. We believe that these are separate issues,"" he said. The Prime Minister of Albania also wished Ukraine an end to the war and establishment of peace. For his part, the Prime Minister of Montenegro stressed that the visit to Kyiv is a sign of support for the Ukrainian people, who are fighting for common values of Europe and for the right to choose their own future. He said that Montenegro, Albania and North Macedonia unequivocally support the choice of the Ukrainian people and government in favor of democratic principles. ""The same applies to joining the EU. You have the support of Montenegro, Albania and North Macedonia to unite with the European family,"" said Dritan Abazović. He expressed hope that the position of the heads of the three Balkan countries in support of Ukraine would be heard by other European partners. The Prime Minister of Montenegro also noted that the three countries are ready to contribute to the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine, in particular, by providing equipment and funding. ""In our person you have a faithful friend. We will do everything we can to support you in all your endeavors. After all, we faced your experience 30 years ago and we know for sure what aggression, war, ruin and war crimes are. In the name of peace, friendship and solidarity of all European countries, I wish you well and happiness in the future,"" said Dritan Abazović."
Address by the President of Ukraine to both houses of the Parliament of the Czech Republic,2022-06-15T15:23:00Z,"Dear Mr. President of the Senate! Dear Madam President of the Chamber of Deputies! Dear Prime Minister, members of the government! Dear members of the parliament, attendees, journalists! Dear Czech people! First of all, I would like to thank you for this opportunity to address both houses of the Parliament of the Czech Republic and absolutely all Czechs in this format today. I would like to thank you for those warm words, strong words of support for our people, me personally, our state, which were heard here today, and for the warmth with which you shelter our forcibly displaced persons. We appreciate it, it's truly historical. I am grateful to you for this personally and on behalf of every Ukrainian. I was thinking how to begin my speech. I will begin with words that each of you knows for sure and that all Europeans who respect history and freedom on our continent know for sure: Jsme s vámi, buďte s námi! These are words of extraordinary importance. They had such importance when they sounded on Czech radio in 1968, supporting the resistance. They are extremely important now as well, when - recalling them - we are talking about those who fought for freedom for your people. But, in fact, these words have one more dimension. Now, when the Ukrainian people are fighting for freedom against the brutal Russian invasion, we can say that it is with these words that we, Ukrainians, address all the peoples of Europe, all the peoples of the democratic world. We are with you, be with us! We oppose tyranny, which - as in the past - does not want to stop only in Ukraine. It considers everyone in Europe its target, all those who live a free life. Russia is not interested only in our cities of Mariupol, Severodonetsk, Kharkiv, Odesa and Kyiv. No. Its ambitions are focused on the vast space from Warsaw to Sofia, from Prague to Tallinn. And as in the past, the Russian invasion of Ukraine is only the first step that the Russian leadership needs to open the way to other countries, to the conquest of other nations. This is openly said not only by Russian state propagandists, but also by Russian officials. They have already reached the point, for example, of threatening to officially revoke the recognition of the Baltic states' independence. And then what's next? Who is next? Ladies and Gentlemen! When Ukraine appeals to European countries for support, we are guided by this principle, by these words that have become one of the foundations of your history: we are with you, be with us. Russian tanks storming the cities of the Ukrainian Donbas, trying to attack the Ukrainian Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, must be stopped and burned or expelled from the territory of independent Ukraine. So that they can never again come to Prague, or to Ostrava, or to Brno, or to Pilsen, or to Karlovy Vary, or to any other city on our continent. It is in Ukraine that the battle for the future of Europe is taking place right now. I am very grateful to your state, to your people for the generous help in this struggle. The Czech Republic helped us both with weapons - very substantively and immediately after it became necessary - and politically. I thank the leadership of the state for that. You can be sure that you have supported yourself and your own freedom, your own life with that. And support must be maintained for as long as it takes to win. This is how this confrontation must end - with victory. And even if some politicians in some countries are afraid of the possibility that freedom will win and tyranny will lose, there are no your leaders among such politicians. The Czech people are well aware of how compromises at the expense of others end and what concessions to tyranny lead to, which proposes to take away only the supposedly part of the desired territory to pretend that the aggression has stopped. He who wants to capture everything will never stop, taking only part. I urge you to continue together with us, without stopping for a moment, to convince all those who have not yet managed to choose a clear side in this confrontation, which has been going on for 112 days already, of this simple truth. Ukraine must get everything to win. Modern and powerful enough weapons - the Prime Minister talked about that today - to get advantage over the Russian army. Financial support - to have resources against Russia, whose savings and revenues are still very significant - in 100 days of this war since February 24 Russia has already earned 93 billion euros on the sale of energy only. Ukraine must also receive fundamental support of values that will finally deprive Russia of its main ideological weapon, namely the assertion that Europe is incapable of real unification and that it does not need Ukraine. In the near future, we must receive an answer from the European Union - from all member states - to the question of Ukraine's status. Providing Ukraine with the candidacy right now is proving that European unification is real and that European values really work and are not just defined in certain documents as a beautiful formality. The Russian troops are well aware that they are fighting against European values, against the fact that any free people of Europe who share common European values can become part of the European Union. This is the ideological firmware of the Russian occupiers. So strengthening Europe's union and saying “yes” to Ukraine is also a defense in this war. This will be another historical manifestation of the meaning contained in the words: we are with you, be with us. That is why I ask you to be as active as possible these days, these weeks, so that all European leaders agree that defending and strengthening Europe is our common cause, and so that no one can make an exception to this principle. The fateful Czech “eights” - 1938, 1948, 1968 - are comprehensive answers to all those who still want to ""pacify"" the aggressor by betraying European values and weakening Europe. Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear Czech people! The Czech presidency of the European Union will begin in a few weeks. And at this time there will be no less challenges before us, before the whole of Europe, than now. But they are transforming. I very much appreciate the key attention paid to Ukraine in the priorities of the Czech presidency. We have to agree on the seventh package of sanctions against Russia for this aggression, for this war. And we also have to substantively move on to the reconstruction of Ukraine - of the entire liberated territory. When you, Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Petr, visited our capital in March, you became one of the first European leaders to boldly show that Europe is and will be with Ukraine. And I believe that the Czech Republic will be among the leaders in the implementation of the largest economic and infrastructural project of our time - the Ukrainian reconstruction. This is a special opportunity to show all the strength of Europe - technological, institutional, creative. We must ensure full synchronization of the Ukrainian National Reconstruction Plan and the European Reconstruction Platform in order to implement them as efficiently and quickly as possible. I also invite you to join the reconstruction of Ukraine at the national level - taking patronage over one of the regions or cities, or communities, towns of Ukraine, which suffered from Russian aggression. Such a reconstruction will be the best proof that no aggression, no matter how brutal, will ever achieve its goals and be ever able to break any of the European nations, let alone Europe as a whole. I am grateful to you for the sincere and full support of our people, our Ukrainian temporarily displaced persons. You have sheltered hundreds of our people fleeing the war on your land. Thousands of people live in your homes, receive help from your families. We must do everything so that each and every one of them can return home, return to Ukraine. We can come - and we will come - to the fact that the principle of following the rule: ""Jsme s vámi, buďte s námi!"" - will have a result that can be described in other important words - in the words of Václav Havel: ""Truth and love have to overcome lies and hatred."" Unfortunately, this has often failed in the history of Europe. But now, in 2022, in Ukraine and, most importantly, together - we can ensure this so powerfully that the fruits of our victory will be enjoyed by many generations of our nations. Děkuji vám! Ať žije Česko! Glory to Ukraine!"
The Kingdom of Denmark supports the European integration movement of Ukraine - Ihor Zhovkva,2022-06-15T09:19:00Z,"During a working visit to Denmark, Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Ihor Zhovkva met with senior political leadership and government officials. During the negotiations with Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Denmark Mette Frederiksen, Ihor Zhovkva expressed gratitude from President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy for a strong support for our state in resisting full-scale armed aggression. Emphasis was placed on the importance of Copenhagen's support for granting Ukraine candidate status at the forthcoming European Council meeting at the level of EU member states leaders. ""We hope that next week, during the European Council meeting in Brussels, the Kingdom of Denmark will support granting our country the long cherished status of a candidate for EU membership. This is a decision that the citizens of Ukraine deserve, as they are now paying the highest price, defending European values,"" Ihor Zhovkva stressed. The issue of implementing our country's European integration strategy was the focus of Ihor Zhovkva's meeting with Chairman of the Danish Foreign Policy Committee Martin Lidegaard, members of the Foreign Policy Committee, as well as parliamentary committees on foreign policy and European policy. The Deputy Head of the Office of the President expressed hope that after the positive conclusion of the European Commission, the relevant decision on granting our country the status of a candidate country for EU accession will be made in June by the leaders of the member states. ""Giving Ukraine candidate status is only the first step on the path to full EU membership. Accordingly, we hope that the leaders of the European Union will make such an important political decision that will allow us to fix the strategic movement of our country towards the European Union,"" he said. During the meeting with Minister of Defence of Denmark Morten Bødskov, cooperation in the military-technical field was discussed. The Deputy Head of the President's Office thanked the Danish side for important military assistance, especially the transfer of Harpoon-type missiles, and expressed hope that Denmark would continue its efforts to strengthen resistance to Russian military aggression. During the meeting with Permanent Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Jeppe Tranholm-Mikkelsen, the issues of practical implementation of Ukraine's European integration strategy and the possibility of using Denmark's advisory and other practical assistance were discussed. Ihor Zhovkva and Jeppe Tranholm-Mikkelsen also exchanged views on the prospects of deepening Ukraine's integration into the EU internal market, which will allow for the gradual recovery of the domestic economy. During the meeting with the Minister for Industry, Business and Financial Affairs of the Kingdom of Denmark Simon Kollerup, the main focus was on the prospects of involving Denmark in the post-war reconstruction of destroyed facilities in the regions of our country. Ihor Zhovkva thanked Denmark for sending free construction equipment to Ukraine - excavators, loaders, trucks, which are already working for the needs of our country: “I would like to express words of sincere gratitude to Denmark for the leadership in restoring and rebuilding the territories of Ukraine that suffered destruction as a result of Russia's aggression. We appreciate that Denmark was one of the first to respond to the initiative of the President of Ukraine on patronage by international partners and will be involved in the restoration of the city of Mykolaiv."" Issues of financial, humanitarian, expert and other practical assistance for the needs of Ukraine were discussed in detail during Ihor Zhovkva's meetings with Danish State Secretary for Development Policy of Danish MFA Lotte Machon and Deputy Director General at The Confederation of Danish Industry Thomas Bustrup. Together with Copenhagen's Deputy Mayor for Employment and Integration Jens-Kristian Lütken, Ihor Zhovkva visited the Center for Ukrainian Displaced Persons in the Danish capital. ""I sincerely thank the Danish people, the Danish government and the Copenhagen city authorities for their support for the temporarily displaced citizens of Ukraine. This is a testament to your country's solidarity with Ukrainians who have suffered from Russia's war and war crimes,"" said the Deputy Head of the President's Office."
"Even though Russia has fewer and fewer modern missiles, Ukraine's need for anti-missile systems remains - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-06-14T22:29:00Z,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today, our air defense units managed to ""cut the wings"" of Russian missiles. Some of the missiles fired by the occupiers at our cities were shot down. And these are saved lives. This is a saved infrastructure. But we managed to shoot down only part of them. Unfortunately, there are victims, there is destruction. Today, the Lviv and Ternopil regions were hit. And we keep telling our partners that Ukraine needs modern anti-missile weapons. Our country does not have it at a sufficient level yet, but it is our country in Europe that needs such weapons most right now. Delay with its provision cannot be justified. I will constantly emphasize this when talking to our partners. We made the first requests for anti-missile systems long before the full-scale invasion. And this week there will be many different important talks - and not only with European politicians who are able to provide Ukraine with modern anti-missile systems. Even though Russia has fewer and fewer modern missiles with each passing day, Ukraine's need for such systems remains. Because Russia still has enough Soviet types of missiles, which are even more dangerous. They are many times less precise, and therefore threaten civilian objects and ordinary residential buildings much more. I spoke today with Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau. Of course, the number one topic was defense support. Canada is among the leaders in it. I expressed gratitude for the fact that Canada became the first country to transfer special assistance to the Ukrainian account at the IMF - about $ 800 million. I also had a conversation with the President of Ecuador. I congratulated him on the election of Ecuador as a member of the UN Security Council. I informed him about the current situation on the battlefield and called for increasing pressure on Russia to end this war. Both this conversation with the President of Ecuador and yesterday's conversation with the President of Guatemala are just the beginning of our new policy of restoring relations with Latin America. Today I asked the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to be very attentive to reports in the media and on social networks that some of our fighters do not have enough personal protective equipment. The reports I receive are significantly different from what is discussed by society. And I expect inspections of logistics in the army - inspections of what is supplied and how personal protective equipment is distributed. Today, everyone in the areas of hostilities must have everything they need to protect themselves. The state provides such supplies. Over the past day no drastic changes have taken place in the battle in Donbas. The fiercest fighting is in Severodonetsk and in all cities and communities nearby - as before. The losses, unfortunately, are painful. But we have to hold on. This is our state. It is vital to hold on there, in Donbas. The more losses the enemy suffers there, the less power they will have to continue the aggression. Therefore, the Donbas direction is key to determining who will dominate in the coming weeks. We also have painful losses in the Kharkiv region, where the Russian army is trying to strengthen its position. The battles for this direction continue, and we still have to fight hard for complete security for Kharkiv and the region. We continue to put pressure on the occupiers in the south. The key goal is the liberation of Kherson, and we will move towards this step by step. I signed another decree on awarding those who excelled in battles. 63 servicemen were awarded for bravery and efficiency in defending the state. The total number of awarded is already 18,453. And such a scale, such a number of feats fully demonstrate the level of confrontation and the brutality of hostilities. I thank everyone who stood up for our state! Eternal memory to everyone whose life was taken by the occupiers! Glory to Ukraine!"
Ukraine will win if Europe and the world continue to be united - President,2022-06-14T17:45:00Z,"Ukraine's power and ability to resist the Russian army, which is the second largest in the world, depend on the unity of Europe and the world. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during an online press conference for Danish media. ""It is important for me that we remain Ukrainians not only in our souls, but also on our land,"" he said. The President stressed the importance of restoring territorial integrity. According to him, the result of the war should be respect for the Ukrainian people, land and sovereignty of Ukraine. ""I understand that not all at once. I understand that this is a great challenge - the Russian Federation is fighting against us, whose army, as they say, is the second most powerful in the world,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The Head of State noted that Ukraine must be ready for any security challenge, so it must build its defense system so as to always be able to respond to a possible Russian invasion. ""In any case, a united Europe and a united world is the only possibility of a strong army on the territory of our state, a strong Ukrainian army,"" he added. The President noted the efforts of world leaders to support the Ukrainian army and economy, as well as sanctions pressure on the aggressor state. ""There were concrete steps to strengthen our army with weapons. Then there were steps to strengthen our economy, financial support. And then there were steps to weaken the Russian economy. This is a policy of sanctions against Russia. It is in these three areas that we need the unity of the world and Europe. It is not easy, but our strength depends on it. The liberation of our territories from the Russian occupiers depends very much on this union… If everyone continues to be strong and united, we will definitely win this war,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The President of Ukraine noted that much depends on the personal position of European leaders. In this context, he thanked for the help from Denmark, recalling that Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen visited our country in April, during a full-scale war. As for granting Ukraine the status of a candidate for EU membership, according to the President, Denmark, which has questions about anti-corruption infrastructure, has incomplete information about the real state of affairs in our country. ""I think many EU countries don't have such a developed anti-corruption infrastructure that works during the war and (worked - ed.) before the war as Ukraine has,"" he said. In particular, according to the President, NABU, NACP and Supreme Anticorruption Court continue to work in our country despite an attempt to block the powers of some of them due to the decision of the Constitutional Court. The Head of State emphasized that much had been done to reform the law enforcement and judicial systems in Ukraine. In particular, two main laws on judicial reform were passed and enacted, which could not be passed during the 30 years of independence. ""But everything we have done about the anti-corruption structure, judicial reform is not related to joining the EU. It is for ourselves, for Ukraine. We want Ukraine to be fast, modern, without any bureaucracy,"" he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also reminded that thanks to the Ministry of Digital Transformation, many public services for the citizens of Ukraine have become available online. This has reduced bureaucracy and corruption. And even during the full-scale war, the ""Diia"" public services portal is functioning effectively and expanding the list of services that Ukrainians can get online. ""I believe that because Ukraine fights and defends the values shared with the European Union, it should be at least a candidate for EU membership. Ukraine has long deserved to be a member of the EU, but there is a certain procedure,"" the President stressed."
"Russia does not protect Russian-speakers, but imposes its narratives by military means, violating all laws and international law - Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-06-14T17:28:00Z,"Russia claims to be protecting the rights of Russian-speaking people in Ukraine, but most of the cities destroyed by the Russian army were inhabited by Russian-speaking residents, and many are now switching to Ukrainian. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during an online press conference for Danish media. ""For eight years, the Russian Federation has been entering our territory by military means, holding some conditional referendums at gunpoint, which are completely illegal and breach international law. Don't you think it's very strange?” the Head of State remarked. ""And if the Russian Federation comes to you and says: it seems to us that someone here is insulting two or three people who spoke Russian, they don't get proper service in restaurants or something was said to them in a store. We don't care, the Russian military will say, that these issues are resolved in court or in dialogue - in a civilized way, as in any society. Let's hold a referendum, they will say. And they will come with tanks, killing children… Is this the format of a civilized referendum? It just looks like Nazism,"" the President added. He stressed that the Russian soldiers in Ukraine rape women, kidnap children, forcibly deport Ukrainian citizens to Russia, depriving them of all documents and rights. ""They came up with a narrative that they are protecting Russian-speaking people, but there were Russian-speaking people in most of the cities they completely destroyed, where there are no more buildings or people. And they are now switching to Ukrainian because they are shocked at how the Russian army could have done that to them,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The Head of State stressed that today the President of the Russian Federation alone decides whether to stop the Russian army or not. Therefore, he is ready to negotiate with Vladimir Putin. ""If Russia wants to end the war - because that's what they say in the media - they have to sit down at the negotiating table. The negotiating table on Ukraine is impossible without Ukraine. Therefore, these negotiations must be direct. We can talk to intermediaries, we can talk without intermediaries - I don't care. If the Russian Federation is ready to end the war, which means to withdraw troops from our territories, I am personally ready for such a format at any moment,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy, adding that every opportunity should be used to end the war, no matter how difficult it is."
"The deoccupation of our territories depends on the supply of weapons to Ukraine, delay threatens stagnation on the front – President",2022-06-14T17:15:00Z,"The speed of deoccupation of the territories of our state depends on the supply of weapons to Ukraine, and any delays in this matter threaten stagnation on the front. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during an online press conference for Danish media. ""I am grateful that it is coming (weaponry - ed.). But it must come faster if we all live by the same goal - to have peace, to have no war in Europe and so that this war of the Russian Federation does not go to other countries, to the European Union and NATO countries. And I am sure that it has such dreams and thoughts,"" the Head of State said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that the future aggressor's plans for other states depend on the strength and resilience of Ukraine. ""I am sure that if Ukraine is not strong, they will move on. Kyiv is not the finish line in their marathon. This is the beginning for them. We have shown our strength, and now it is very important that our Western partners show this strength together with us,"" said the President of Ukraine. According to the President, if the supply of weapons is delayed, the war in Ukraine will become stagnant. ""Everyone will stand still. There will be a move of one or another side one to five kilometers forward, and then - one to five kilometers back. If we get more weapons requested from our partners, we will start moving forward,"" the President said."
"Tell people in the occupied territories about Ukraine, that the Ukrainian army will definitely come - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-06-13T21:52:00Z,"Strong people of an unbreakable country! Today is the 110th day of our defense. And when you say that - the 110th day - you realize what a great path we have covered. The enemy was driven out of the Zhytomyr, Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions. A large part of the Kharkiv region was liberated. In total, more than a thousand settlements have been liberated. The invasion of the occupiers in the south of Ukraine was stopped. Yes, they still want to destroy Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, and the cities of the Dnipropetrovsk region. They still have enough strength to shoot from the artillery at Zelenodolsk and Hulyaipole. Odesa remains a target for the Russian fleet... But dozens of the attacking attempts of the Russian army have already been thwarted right there in the south. And thanks to the counteroffensive, some communities in the Kherson region have already been liberated. In the battles in Donbas - and they will surely go down in military history as one of the most brutal battles in Europe and for Europe - the Ukrainian army and our intelligence tactically still beat the Russian military. And this is despite the significant advantage of the Russians in the amount of equipment, and especially - artillery systems. The price of this battle for us is very high. It's just scary. And we draw the attention of our partners on a daily basis to the fact that only a sufficient number of modern artillery for Ukraine will ensure our advantage and finally the end of Russian torture of the Ukrainian Donbas. Today it became known about the death of another child caused by the Russian shelling - right there, right in Donbas, in the Luhansk region. The boy was born in 2016. He lived in Lysychansk, in an ordinary house on Moskovska Street. This is it: a six-year-old boy on Moskovska Street is also, as it turned out, a dangerous enemy for the Russian Federation... We are dealing with absolute evil. And we have no choice but to move on. Free our entire territory. Drive the occupiers out of all our regions. And although now the width of our front is already more than 2.5 thousand kilometers, it is felt that the strategic initiative is still ours. We will come to all our cities, to all our villages, which do not yet have our flag on the administrative buildings. Although there are a lot of Ukrainian flags there, in people’s houses, I'm sure of it. And we have already seen them when people protested against the occupiers. And we will see them again - everywhere, when we return. We will come to Kherson. And ordinary Kherson residents will meet our army on the streets of the city. The failure of the occupiers, who tried to celebrate the so-called Russia Day, only proves that Kherson is a Ukrainian city. And Kherson residents will celebrate only Ukrainian holidays. We will come to Melitopol. And we will return to all Melitopol residents the opportunity to live without fear. And, by the way, all the collaborators who are now threatening to take away land from farmers in Melitopol and other districts of Zaporizhzhia will most likely end up in this land themselves. We will come to Mariupol. And we will liberate the city for the third time. It was liberated from the Nazis in 1943 by a brilliant operation. In 2014, on this day, June 13, thanks to the courage of our ""Azov"" and other units, Mariupol was liberated for the second time. Liberated from the militants, who at that time were not yet fully aware of what the Russian state was sending them to. And now they see it all. They see burned Mariupol. They see why the Russians came there. But we will not allow them to make this city dead. We will return it. Definitely. It only takes enough weapons to make it happen. The partners have it. In sufficient quantities. And we work every day for the political will to give us these weapons to appear. We will come to Enerhodar. And I want to repeat to everyone in the city who took to the streets against the Russian military, who refuses to cooperate with the occupiers and who is waiting for us today. I want to repeat that we have not forgotten about our Enerhodar for a day. We must understand that the occupiers are keeping the occupied territory not just in an information blockade. I would call it a civilizational blockade. They are trying to make people not just know nothing about Ukraine and how we are trying to liberate our territory. They are trying to make them stop even thinking about returning to normal life, forcing them to reconcile. In some areas, the occupiers are deliberately preventing the restoration of electricity supply. In many communities, they simply blocked communication. Our television is being turned off. They closed the exit from the occupation and simply do not even allow humanitarian corridors so that we can bring people at least basic goods and medicines. And I ask everyone who has such an opportunity to communicate with people in the occupied south, in Donbas, in the Kharkiv region. Tell them about Ukraine. Tell them the truth. Say that there will be liberation. Say it to Kyrylivka, Henichesk, Berdyansk, Manhush. Say it to Horlivka, Donetsk, Luhansk. Say it to everyone in the Kharkiv region who is still forced to see the Russian flag on our Ukrainian land. Tell them that the Ukrainian army will definitely come. Of course, we will liberate our Crimea as well. The flag of Ukraine will fly again over Yalta and Sudak, over Dzhankoi and Yevpatoriya. And let every Russian official who has seized precious land in Crimea remember: this is not the land where they will have peace. There is no one today who will say exactly how long our path to victory will take. But the vast majority of people today are already aware - this is our path. This is how this war will end. We will rebuild everything that was destroyed by the occupiers. From Volnovakha to Chortkiv. Because this is Ukraine. And it is our destiny to return and strengthen it. I am proud of all our defenders! Eternal glory to you! Eternal memory to everyone whose life was taken by the occupiers! Glory to Ukraine!

Address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the participants of the American Jewish Committee Global Forum,2022-06-13T13:22:00Z,"Ladies and Gentlemen, friends! Mr. David Harris! Every morning I receive several informational reports. Regarding the situation on the frontline, the Russian missile strikes at Ukraine, at our people, and the number of victims of hostilities over the past day. Today, as I record this address, the report on the deceased has changed significantly. The list of killed children became longer by 24 surnames at once, and now it has 287 items. And this is probably one of the worst things that happen during a war. The Russian troops have occupied part of our country, and we do not have complete information about what is happening in the occupied areas. We do not know everything about the murders and other crimes they commit there, in the occupied part of Ukraine. We do not know what they did against our people. We do not know how many bodies the occupiers buried in mass graves or left in the ruins of destroyed cities. But gradually we learn about it. And that's how the list of killed children became 24 points longer at once - these are the children who died because of Russian strikes at Mariupol, now we know about them. The boy Maksym is among these 24 children, he was born this year; and the girl Darya, she was also born this year. Maksym and Darya did not live even three months. They died with their parents when they were all buried in the basement of an ordinary apartment building on which a Russian aircraft dropped a bomb. Tell me why is this happening in 2022? This is not the 1940s. How could mass killings, torture, burned cities, filtration camps set up by the Russian military in the occupied territories, which resemble Nazi concentration camps, become a reality? And yet Russia hopes that it will not bear responsibility for all this evil, for all these barbaric strikes at houses, hospitals and churches. Russia still has the power to hope to continue the war against Ukraine, against people and ignore the world's reaction. Ladies and Gentlemen! I am aware of your substantive help for our state. But I ask you to redouble your efforts to stop Russian hatred. Hatred for humanity. Yes, it is hatred that is the driving force of this ongoing Russian war against Ukraine and against freedom in Europe, in the world. Hatred for Ukrainian - for the culture of Ukrainians, for the history of Ukraine and for the fact that despite all the horrors of the past, Ukraine has remained a kind and open country for different cultures. Diversity is an important feature of Ukraine. What will be left of this openness, of this peaceful coexistence of different peoples? Russian shells burn even Russian churches in Ukraine. The Russian army destroyed communities in which the Greek community had lived for centuries. Crimean Tatars are the most repressed on the occupied peninsula. Russian missiles hit Babyn Yar in Kyiv, Russian artillery damaged the Menorah in Drobytsky Yar near Kharkiv. Openly anti-Semitic remarks by Russian Foreign Minister have instigated a global scandal. Is this not enough? But it is really not the 1940s now. Therefore, defend the need to enhance sanctions against Russia. You are capable of it. Help us speed up the supply of weapons to Ukraine so that we can liberate the occupied territories. We need powerful weapons for the offensive, without which the war will only drag on and the number of victims will increase. I know that your help is already significant. But you can use even more of your influence. Because we now have a historic opportunity to defend our common freedom, our common security, our common cultural diversity from the greatest wave of hatred that has threatened the world in recent decades. So, let's end this war! Let's defeat Russian hatred! In the name of children killed by the Russian army. And for the future of millions of children in Ukraine and in various European countries who deserve to live in security and peace. To just live. Thank you for your support! Glory to Ukraine!"
There are already 2606 affirmative answers to the question of whether Ukraine needs modern missile defense systems - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-06-12T21:46:00Z,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! After the missile strike at the Ternopil region, ten people are still in hospitals. There was no tactical or strategic sense in this strike, as in the vast majority of other Russian strikes. This is terror, just terror. Among the victims is a 12-year-old girl from Kharkiv. She went to the Ternopil region to flee from the Russian army. And such facts will now determine perception of Russia in the world. Not Peter I or Lev Tolstoy, but children wounded and killed by Russian strikes. Today is the 109th day of a full-scale war, but it is not the 109th day as we tell our partners a simple thing: Ukraine needs modern missile defense systems. The supply of such systems was possible this year, last year and even earlier. Did we get them? No. Do we need them? Yes. There have already been 2606 affirmative answers to this question in the form of various Russian cruise missiles that have hit Ukrainian cities. Our cities, our villages for the period from February 24. These are lives that could have been saved, these are tragedies that could have been prevented if Ukraine had been listened to. The key tactical goal of the occupiers has not changed. They are pressing in Severodonetsk, where very fierce fighting is going on - literally for every meter. And they are also pressing in the direction of Lysychansk, Bakhmut, Slovyansk and so on. The Russian army is trying to deploy reserve forces in Donbas. But what reserves can they have now? It seems that they will try to throw into battle poorly trained conscripts and those who were gathered by covert mobilization. Russian generals see their people simply as the cannon fodder they need to gain an advantage in numbers — in manpower, in military equipment. And this means only one thing: Russia can cross the line of 40,000 of its lost troops already in June. In no other war in many decades have they lost so much. I prepared an address to the American Jewish Committee. A global forum organized by the committee began in New York today. This is one of the most influential structures that helps promote decisions for our protection. I called on them to redouble their efforts so that we could get more modern weapons, more financial support for our state, so that we could end this war sooner. This week I will continue to address the parliaments of the partner countries, in particular the parliament of the Czech Republic. Many talks of various levels with European politicians are also planned. We work every day with the European Union on the candidate status for Ukraine, and our state has done everything for a positive response. The only question is the determination of some European leaders. We will continue to work to facilitate access of Ukrainian goods to all important markets around the world. Customs duties on trade with the European Union have already been abolished. The United States already applies a duty-free regime for Ukrainian steel. Canada has abolished customs duties. The same regime will work in the near future with Britain. We expect trade liberalization from Australia. The Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization has started today. Before it began, representatives of 57 countries gathered for a special event of solidarity with Ukraine, and I am grateful to them - to each and everyone - for that. And as a result of this intergovernmental conference, we will learn, in particular, the timing of the decision on trade liberalization for Ukraine from Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein, Iceland. So the week will be significant. And I believe that there will be good news for Ukraine. I am grateful to all who defend our state! Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
Address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the charity evening organized by CORE,2022-06-12T21:18:00Z,"Ladies and Gentlemen, CORE and all the participants of this charity evening! 107 days ago, Russia launched a full-scale war against us. All of you have heard about the horrors that Ukraine is going through. Tens of thousands of explosions and shots. Hundreds of thousands wounded and killed. Millions who have lost their homes. All of this is not a logline for a horror film. All of this is our reality. All of you have seen photos from Ukraine. Peaceful cities and villages wiped off the face of the earth. All of this is not the scenery of a blockbuster about the apocalypse. All of this is our reality. All of you have seen footage from Ukraine. Cruise missiles and bombs that raze schools, hospitals, theaters, museums, entire streets and neighborhoods to the ground. It is not VFX, not computer graphics. All of this is our reality. But definitely we will rebuild Ukraine. Streets and neighborhoods, peaceful cities and villages. We will heal bodies from wounds and souls from losses. All of this is not a synopsis of a fiction film. All of this is our reality and our future. And all of you can help us in this. During World War II, when all the metal was needed at the frontline, the Oscar statuette was made of plaster. It can fairly be said that this is a symbolic gesture that does not drastically affect the course of the war. But we cannot claim that the world would have defeated Nazism without a piece of metal. No. We do not know for sure. That is why we know that any help is valuable and important. I thank everyone who has come here today for the sake of this help – help for Ukraine. Mr. Sean Penn, who has been personally in Kyiv and Ukraine since the first day of the war and has seen firsthand this evil, which is called Russian full-scale aggression. You were ready to melt your Oscar in protest against the lack of support to Ukraine. I hope that this will not be necessary. Other metal must melt. Weapons of barbarians, which kill civilians, women, the elderly and small children, must melt. The aggressor's equipment, its tanks, planes, ships, rockets and all other iron that brings evil must melt. We have been resisting it for 107 days in a row. We can stop it together. Support Ukraine because Ukraine supports the whole world. Fight for Ukraine because Ukraine is fighting for the whole world. For democracy. For freedom. For life! Glory to Ukraine!"
"The decision to grant Ukraine candidate status will strengthen not only our state, but also the entire EU - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-06-11T23:30:00Z,"I wish health to all Ukrainians and all our friends! The final phase of the big diplomatic marathon, which is to end in a week and a half, has started today. And in this marathon we are actually together with the European Union - in one team, and this team has to win. I am sure that we will soon receive an answer on the candidate status for Ukraine. I am convinced that this decision can strengthen not only our state, but also the entire European Union. What else needs to happen in Europe to make it clear to skeptics that the very fact of keeping Ukraine outside the European Union works against Europe? For example, everything is already obvious to the Russian occupiers. They say so when they torment our people that it is allegedly for the fact that Ukraine has gone to Europe. And why does Europe have skeptics then? We will continue to work even harder at all levels to get the right decision. It is very important for us. Very fruitful talks with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen were held in Kyiv today. I am pleased to note her sincerity. It is the European Commission that will prepare a conclusion regarding our application. Ukraine provided all the necessary answers in a very short time, and it was done well. There will be many more equally important and, I hope, fruitful talks with European leaders next week. I talked to the participants of a very representative security forum in Asia, in Singapore. High level. The event was attended by defense ministers and other high-ranking officials from dozens of countries of the region. We really need this region. And I felt that today my address was heard there, arguments were heard and perceived. News about the distribution of Russian passports in Kherson and the distribution of passports in Melitopol were actively spread in the occupied territories and in Russia. And I looked at who in this news was shown as Kherson and Melitopol residents who allegedly want Russian passports. A few collaborators and people from their entourage... Well, it looked like not a queue to get a passport, but an attempt to get a ticket to flee. Very demonstrative. The Ukrainian troops are gradually liberating the territory of the Kherson region. Today the village of Tavriis'ke has been added to the list of returned settlements of our state. There is certain success in the Zaporizhzhia region as well. Fierce street battles continue in Severodonetsk. I am proud of all our defenders who managed to stop the advance of these hostile people, these occupiers for many weeks already and keep our defense strong. Do you remember how Russia hoped to capture the entire Donbas in early May? It is already the 108th day of the war, it is already June. Donbas is holding on. The losses suffered by the occupiers, including in this area, are extremely significant. In total, the Russian army today has about 32,000 dead souls. For what? What did it give you, Russia? No one can say now how long this burning of souls by Russia will last. But we must do everything to make the occupiers regret that they have done all this, and to hold them accountable for every murder and every strike at our beautiful state. Eternal glory to all who defend Ukraine! Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
The EU's first Ukrainian Center for Displaced Persons was opened in Vilnius,2022-06-11T18:29:00Z,"The first Ukrainian center in the European Union for citizens who were forced to leave Ukraine was opened in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. Since the beginning of the Russian aggression, the Republic of Lithuania has sheltered more than 50,000 Ukrainian displaced persons. The cultural center was established at the initiative of the first ladies of the two countries - Olena Zelenska and Diana Nausėdienė. The premises for it were provided by Vytautas Magnus University. The symbolic ribbon was cut at the ceremony by the First Lady of Lithuania, Ambassador of Ukraine to the Republic of Lithuania Petro Beshta and Rector of the University Juozas Augutis. Olena Zelenska joined the event via video call from Kyiv. ""When we conceived this center with a colleague, let me say, with my friend and a great friend of Ukraine Diana Nausėdienė, we wanted Ukrainians who were forced to come to Lithuania because of the war to have a truly native place. We wanted the center to be really the place where one can address any question - help or communication. We wanted people to be able to study here, to spend leisure time. Join a cultural event or educational course,"" she said. Former Lithuanian Ambassador to Ukraine Algirdas Kumža, signatory of the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania, became the Head of the Ukrainian Center in Vilnius. According to the plan, the Ukrainian Center will become a place of education, career guidance, psychological assistance, recreation for children, youth and adults. Here you can leave your child for extracurricular activities, attend lectures, educational courses or spend time on hobbies. The center will also be a platform for cultural diplomacy between countries, present Ukraine, its culture and identity in Lithuania, participate in academic activities, hold creative meetings, concerts and other events. ""Together with our partners, we promised to actively cooperate and do everything possible to ensure that Ukrainians feel safe in Lithuania, receive medical and social assistance, educational services and, most importantly, cherish their culture and preserve the nation's vitality,"" Diana Nausėdienė said."
"Russia's war against Ukraine continues, so a powerful seventh package of sanctions is needed - President following talks with Ursula von der Leyen in Kyiv",2022-06-11T17:08:00Z,"During a meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Kyiv, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for the preparation of the seventh package of sanctions against Russia, which should be even more powerful. ""I am grateful to the European Union for its sanctions policy against Russia, which is very helpful in our struggle. Six packages of EU sanctions have become a tangible instrument of pressure on Russia during the war. But the war continues. Therefore, the seventh package of sanctions is needed, and it should be even more powerful,"" the President said during a meeting with media representatives following talks with Ursula von der Leyen in Kyiv. In particular, according to him, all Russian officials and judges working for war and repression should be subject to sanctions. The European Union must also completely block the activities of all Russian banks. First of all, this applies to Gazprombank, which finances Russia's anti-European policy. In addition, sanctions are needed against all Russian companies that in one way or another help the state in the military sphere or in suppressing democracy and freedom of speech. ""And, of course, the European Union, for its own benefit, must work much faster to completely abandon Russia's energy resources. This is a fundamental issue of security for all - both for Ukraine and for each EU state,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, adding that work is underway on other areas of sanctions policy as well."
Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with the President of the European Commission in Kyiv,2022-06-11T16:53:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, who is on a visit to our country. The President greeted the President of the European Commission in Ukraine, noting that this is her second visit in two months during a full-scale war, which testifies to the significant contribution of Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen to the support for our country and the common struggle for freedom in Europe. ""It is definitely a crucial time. And not only for Ukraine, but also for the European Union. It is now being determined what the future of a united Europe will be and whether this future will be at all. Russia wants to destroy European unity, it wants to leave Europe divided and weak. The whole of Europe is a target for Russia, and Ukraine is only the first stage in this aggression, in these plans. That is why the European Union's positive response to Ukraine's application for membership can be a positive response to the question of whether the European project has a future at all,” said Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a meeting with media representatives after talks with the European Commission President in Kyiv. The Head of State stressed that the Ukrainian people have already made an extremely great contribution to the protection of common freedom and European values and proved that state and public institutions in Ukraine remain stable and Ukrainians are fully integrated into the European space. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have provided comprehensive answers to the questionnaire in a very short time and are waiting for the European Commission's conclusion next week on Ukraine's compliance with the Copenhagen criteria for EU membership. ""The vast majority of Europeans consider Ukraine part of the European family. And rightly so. We are very much looking forward to the recognition of such a reality at the political level on June 23-24, when the historic meeting of the European Council is to take place. Meeting, the logical decision of which should be to grant Ukraine the status of a candidate country. We really believe in that,"" he said. The President of Ukraine noted that the candidate status is only the beginning of the movement towards EU membership, and Ukraine will still have to cover the path from candidate to full membership. ""But everyone has already seen that the Ukrainian people value freedom so much and are so much ready to fight for their future that they will do everything necessary for Ukraine's European integration. The European project certainly cannot be complete without us, without Ukraine, and this is absolutely obvious right now, when the Ukrainian people are bravely defending the future for themselves and all the nations of Europe,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. The President also thanked Ursula von der Leyen for the European Commission's proposal of a new program of assistance to Ukraine in the amount of 9 billion euros and efforts to prepare for the reconstruction of our country after the war. ""We are coordinating our steps in this direction to synchronize our internal Plan for the reconstruction of Ukraine and the European Platform for the reconstruction of our state. I believe that together with the European Commission and European countries we will be able to create all conditions for the most ambitious economic project of our time, namely - full and rapid recovery of Ukraine after this tragedy, after this war,"" said the President. The President noted that the decision to abolish tariffs and quotas on Ukrainian exports to the European Union has already entered into force. He also thanked for organizing ""green corridors"" to promote exports from Ukraine. ""We have already started negotiations in the field of transport to conclude an agreement on the liberalization of road freight transport. In the field of energy, the synchronization of our energy network with the European one has reached a new level - from now on, significant exports of our electricity to the countries of the European Union are possible. All this and many other lines of our cooperation strengthen both Ukraine and our neighbors in the EU, and, I believe, strengthen the entire European Union,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. For her part, Ursula von der Leyen noted that by the end of next week the European Commission should complete discussions on granting Ukraine the status of a candidate for accession to the European Union. ""On this path, we very much appreciate the efforts that Ukraine is making and the determination with which your country is moving. People have proven their motivation and determination. Therefore, I am convinced that together we will be able to overcome this terrible war. Together we will rebuild this beautiful country, modernize Ukraine,"" said the President of the European Commission. She noted that the European Commission is working on the Platform for Reconstruction of Ukraine and is very enthusiastic about this issue. ""EU member states, other partners of Ukraine, international financial institutions, civil society, people, business are very interested in supporting the reconstruction of Ukraine,"" said Ursula von der Leyen. According to her, this platform will allow synchronizing joint work on the restoration of Ukraine. ""We want to direct investments, ensure the implementation of reforms, so that it improves the lives of Ukrainians, so that we can rebuild Ukraine, make it attractive for investment, so that Ukraine creates attractive conditions for doing business and can move towards the European Union,"" she said. Ursula von der Leyen stressed that Ukraine has implemented important reforms in the areas of economy and the rule of law. According to her, our country must continue this path."
The world must return Russia to its borders - Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Asian Security Summit,2022-06-11T14:17:00Z,"Today, the world must return Russia to its borders, not seek an understanding with it, because no one will be able to appease the Russian leadership with words alone. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during the online participation in the Asian Security Summit ""Shangri-La Dialogue"". ""The military and political leadership of the Russian Federation can no longer be appeased. It's too late for that. Talking to them on a daily basis, imposing specific financial and economic sanctions - all this had to be done earlier, before the full-scale invasion. Today there is no ""gray"" zone, there is only support. If you support peace, you support Ukraine. If you support the specific war, then you find some kind of understanding with the Russian Federation,"" the President said in response to questions from summit participants. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, now no one will be able to appease Russia with any words - it will only be a political game on the part of the Russian authorities. ""I believe that today the world must clearly put the Russian Federation and its leadership in their place. And their place is on their territory. And they should stay there, live and decide what to do there,"" the President stressed. At the same time, he stressed that Ukraine does not intend to cross Russia's borders in any way. ""Ukraine is on its own land. To go far to Ukraine means to enter the territory of Russia. We don't want that. We do not strive for that. We do not do that. We have no such plans. We respect international law, the sovereignty and territorial integrity of any state. But the war is on our land. People are dying on our land. That is why we are putting pressure on Russia from our land,"" the President said. According to the President, the situation in Ukraine should become an example for the whole world of the need to impose preventive sanctions and take other steps to prevent war, without waiting for the beginning of armed conflict, when there are already hundreds of thousands of victims, millions of refugees and other crises. ""Because there is no positive from the war in the world. Nobody benefits from it, except for some political leaders, whose ambitions increase every day due to their political appetite,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy summed up."
"On the battlefield in Ukraine, it is being decided what rules the world will live by - speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Shangri-La Dialogue, the Asian Security Summit",2022-06-11T13:20:00Z,"Dear participants of the Shangri-La Dialogue forum! Ladies and Gentlemen! Mr. Director! Thank you for the honor of speaking to you today. When I was preparing for this meeting with you - so far a virtual meeting, but I hope for live meetings during my visits to your region after our victory in the war - so when I was preparing for this meeting, I was told about a girl. She wrote me a letter asking to support her initiative called Spray Paint Ukraine. This is an initiative to help Ukraine. She created this image, but an NFT image, and gave me this T-shirt so I could wear it, and thus help everyone know about her initiative. And I thought that this situation - this girl's appeal, her idea, her confidence that the President of Ukraine can respond to her initiative, as well as the fact that I am really ready to help - will be important. I wore this T-shirt today. And this may help explain why Ukraine has gained such support in the world and why we will definitely win this war that Russia has started. Can you imagine, for example, the President of Russia, who would respond to the initiative of a girl from your country, to such an initiative? Who would just see a letter of appeal to the Embassy in Singapore to support the idea of a girl unknown to him and wear a T-shirt sent to him? I think this is impossible at all. And that's what really happens. This is the confrontation between ""possible"", which we and many others in the world need, and ""impossible"", for which Russia is desperately fighting. Russia wants to make it impossible for a neighboring country, which it sees solely as its colony, to be able to exist freely, to exist independently. That is why the Russian army has already killed tens of thousands of our people, deported hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians to its territory. Russia has already used 2,595 cruise missiles against us alone - and that's in 108 days! Russia wants to make it impossible for our land, resources and water to be used in the interests of our people. It wants to steal all this, and is actively looting the territory it managed to occupy. Absolutely everything is taken from there - from cars left on the streets and in the yards to equipment of the seized factories, from scrap metal to grain. Just imagine the meanness of the Russian Federation if its representatives stole even a few trolleybuses from our city of Mariupol, which was completely destroyed by the Russian army. This is the ""great Russia"" - stealing trolleybuses. It wants to make it impossible for the nations of the world to be confident in the freedom of navigation. In this basic freedom for peace and prosperity in any region of the planet. From the first minutes of the full-scale war against Ukraine, Russia blocked our ports in the Black Sea using its fleet. During the war, the Russian military attacked, in particular, peaceful merchant ships, and also fired missiles at our port infrastructure. Today, the Black Sea is the most dangerous sea in the world. And this is solely Russia's fault. Although on February 23 this year, on the eve of the war, free and safe navigation was possible in the Black Sea. I can cite such examples for a very long time - examples of what Russia wants to make impossible. I am sure that in many of these examples you will be able to see what is valuable to you. What makes your life the life you value. And I am convinced that you are all interested in the possible free and independent life of your nations, the preservation of your culture, your material and resource wealth. So that no one robs your property, so that your cultural treasures are not taken away. So that no enemy fleet can make your seas dangerous for navigation. Russian propaganda is trying hard to spread in your countries, as in many others, the disinformation thesis that Russia's war against Ukraine is allegedly something about NATO, about the role of America, about the West's attempts to advance somewhere in Europe. But Russia's war against Ukraine is far from just about Europe. It's about globally important things. The Russian leadership wants to reject all the achievements of human history, including the system of international law that we have today, and return to life as in the XIX century or even earlier. When everything that gave billions of people a chance for harmonious development and prosperity was impossible. That is why I want to remind you of the words of a man you all know well: ""If there was no international law and a big fish ate a small one and a small one ate a shrimp, we would not exist."" These are the very wise words of Lee Kuan Yew, a leader who could see the real causes of many things and processes and who knew what should really be appreciated. And that's why I'm in this T-shirt now, that's why I responded to the request of a girl from Singapore. We must value our opportunities. We must appreciate what has been made possible by the wise leadership in the past, by the struggle of many generations of various nations. We must appreciate what gives us the chance to live in peace and work for the common good in our societies and in the world. Hence, we must stop Russia. We must stop the war that this state has started against my state, trying to return the world to the old days, when the freedom of nations and people's lives did not matter. We must break the ability of Russia or any other country in the world to block the seas, to destroy the freedom of navigation. If sanctions, then sanctions. If mirror measures to limit the service of Russian ships in ports, then mirror measures. Russia must feel that its aggressive policy has consequences primarily for itself. And if this does not happen, if the Russian blockade prevents us from continuing to export our food, which the global market currently lacks, the world will face a severe food crisis and famine in many countries in Asia and Africa. Food shortages will inevitably be followed by political chaos, which could lead to the fall of many governments and disaster for many politicians. And you can already see how this catastrophe is approaching, just by looking at rising prices for basic products on the world market and in some countries. This is a direct consequence of Russia's actions. Finally, we must return full force to international law. Since February 24, 287 children have died in Ukraine as a result of Russian strikes. And that's just what we know officially. We do not yet know how many people were buried in mass graves in the occupied territories and how many bodies remained in the ruins of houses in cities still controlled by the Russian army. For murder and torture, for deportations, for destroyed cities, for the use of illicit munitions, including phosphorus bombs, for blackmail with chemical and nuclear weapons - for all this, any state, not just Russia, must be held accountable. And we can make it possible! If we act in a coordinated manner. Although Russia, of course, will try to make it impossible. We can ensure UN reform. So that all states abide by international law, so that no one violates the world order. The UN system and, in particular, the UN Security Council today do not provide a fair representation for most nations of the world. The voices of entire regions of the planet often cannot be heard when it is vital. If this reform had already taken place, we today would be able to respond to any aggression - not just that of Russia - at a truly global level. Ladies and Gentlemen! I am grateful to you for supporting Ukraine. I am grateful to you for your attention to our state. But remember that this support and attention is not only for Ukraine, but also for yourself. For making your future secure. It is on the battlefield in Ukraine that it is being decided what rules the world will live by and what will be possible and what will be impossible. Let's save the world from going back to the days when everything was decided on the basis of the so-called right of force, and individuals and any of their ideas, like many nations, simply did not matter. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!"
Ukraine counts on the decision of the European Union to grant it the status of a candidate for EU membership already in June - Ihor Zhovkva,2022-06-11T10:41:00Z,"Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Ihor Zhovkva met with a delegation of the informal international network United for Ukraine, which included representatives of the national parliaments of Lithuania, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Sweden and Spain. Ihor Zhovkva noted the efforts of the association, which now has more than 280 former and current deputies and high-ranking officials from more than 30 countries, to promote the Ukrainian agenda both within the authorities and societies of their countries and internationally. The Deputy Head of the Office of the President briefed European politicians on the current security situation in Ukraine. He expressed hope that foreign parliamentarians would continue to make every effort for their countries to promptly supply the weapons Ukraine needs, as well as to impose sanctions on Russia. The issue of granting our country the status of a candidate for EU membership during the European Council meeting on June 23-24 this year was discussed separately. ""It is gratifying that all the deputies present here, even from Germany, support granting Ukraine the status of a candidate for EU membership already in June. The adoption of such a formal decision at the upcoming meeting of the European Council is the key to the victory of our country in the war against Russia,"" said Ihor Zhovkva. The Deputy Head of the Office of the President praised the network's efforts to rebuild Ukraine, as well as its proactive role in bringing the Russian military to justice for crimes committed in Ukraine. In this context, Ihor Zhovkva called on the parliaments of the member states to call things by their names and recognize Russia's crimes in Ukraine as genocide of the Ukrainian people, and Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. ""This is not only a question of historical justice, but also an important legal basis for the activities of the postwar international tribunal,"" said Ihor Zhovkva."
Kyrylo Tymoshenko discussed with UNICEF representatives the restoration of educational institutions damaged by Russian aggression,2022-06-11T10:17:00Z,"Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Kyrylo Tymoshenko held a meeting with representatives of theUNICEF on the restoration of educational and children's institutions that had been destroyed or damaged as a result of the Russian invasion. Kyrylo Tymoshenko informed the UNICEF representatives about the plan to restore infrastructure in the affected regions of Ukraine. This plan consists of 16 clusters (houses, schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, roads). ""We need a rapid recovery plan that will help us rebuild homes, kindergartens and medical infrastructure. This is the infrastructure we want to rebuild now, without delay,"" said the Deputy Head of the Office of the President. Kyrylo Tymoshenko informed about the number of schools that were completely destroyed or damaged during the enemy shelling. He stressed that the Ukrainian authorities are negotiating with representatives of private business and non-governmental organizations that may be involved in financing the restoration of educational infrastructure. The Deputy Head of the President's Office told about the projects to rebuild schools that are planned to be implemented with the participation of private investors. For her part, UNICEF Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia, Special Coordinator for the Refugee and Migrant Response Afshan Khan said that the organization supports fundraising initiatives for new equipment and educational materials for Ukrainian schools, as well as training for teachers. UNICEF representatives stressed the need to use new design decisions and build inclusive spaces when renovating schools and kindergartens. The Deputy Head of the Office of the President also informed about the initiative of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which provides for the patronage of Ukraine's partner countries to restore the regions of our country affected as a result of the Russian invasion."
Now all Ukrainians must be a united nation that is fighting and doesn’t allow the world to divert attention away from the events in Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-06-11T00:09:00Z,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! A brief report on the passing day. By the way, it is the 107th day of our defense already. Very fierce fighting continues in Donbas. I repeat these names every day: Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Bakhmut, Slovyansk, many, many others. I repeat them at meetings with the military, with diplomats, talking to representatives of partner countries. Russia wants to destroy every city in Donbas, “every” is not an exaggeration. Like Volnovakha, like Mariupol. All these ruins in once happy cities, black traces of fires, craters from explosions - this is all that Russia can give to its neighbors, Europe and the world. This is probably the fastest example of the complete degradation of any state - the path that the Russian state has covered in 107 days. The Ukrainian troops are doing everything to stop the offensive of the occupiers. As much as possible. As much as the heavy weapons, modern artillery - all that we have asked and continue to ask our partners for - allow them to. I met in Kyiv with Secretary of State for Defence of the United Kingdom Ben Wallace. We talked exactly about this – how to stop Russian aggression, how to deprive it of offensive potential, what other supplies are needed for our army. The Britons demonstrate true leadership in defense matters. I also addressed the British university community today and talked to students. I work at all levels so that the world can hear us and know what we need. There were many questions from students about what our life would be like after this war. About reconstruction, attracting leading experts, about the education system. Of course, we are preparing for a large-scale restoration of our state. Of course, we have already started reconstruction in the liberated territory. Of course, we will change a lot in our lives after this war. And it is good that the world is interested in details, they want to join, they are thinking how to find opportunities to work for Ukraine after our victory. But the battles are still going on. And right now, in these very difficult battles, it is being decided when this ""after"" will come. It is being decided at which frontiers we will finally break the plans of the occupiers. And everyone should remind societies in other countries of this. Of the battles that are going on now. Of the support that is needed now. It depends not only on politicians and diplomats. But also on journalists, activists, entrepreneurs, our displaced persons who are abroad. Now is the time that all Ukrainians must be one - a nation that is fighting and does not allow the world to divert its attention away from what is happening on the battlefield in Ukraine. I also addressed the participants of the Copenhagen Democracy Summit today. I spoke, in particular, about the response of the European Union, which we expect for our application for candidacy. I will emphasize again and again: this will be the EU's response not only to Ukraine, but also to its own future - the future of the European project. I am grateful to the British Government, the World Bank and the Government of Canada for new steps in financial support for Ukraine. The day before, our country received 1.5 billion US dollars: one billion is the World Bank, another 500 million is Britain. Direct budget support. We will use it to pay salaries in the public sector. Canada, for its part, became the first country to send 1 billion Canadian dollars to our administrative account in the IMF. The Government of Ukraine has already started implementing the decisions discussed at this week's meetings. A bill has been approved that will allow customs clearance of cars through the state service in ""Diia"". The whole process of customs clearance will be fully transparent, convenient and immediately remove all the shadow schemes that were possible in previous years in this area. I hope that the people's deputies of Ukraine will quickly vote for such a step. Also today, the government has already presented specific details of new state programs that should provide new jobs and support for business in this very difficult time for all of us. This applies in particular to non-repayable grants for micro-businesses and other special financial support for small and medium-sized enterprises. Despite all the pressure from Russia, despite all the Russian strikes, we will do everything to revive Ukraine's economy, economic activity. In the evening I signed two decrees awarding our heroes. In total, 242 combatants were awarded, eight of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all whose lives were taken by the occupiers! Eternal glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
We must rebuild a new Ukraine - a state that has gained its independence and future - President during a conversation with the student community of Great Britain,2022-06-10T23:19:00Z,"The reconstruction of housing destroyed by the Russian occupiers should include not only the construction of new buildings, but also the construction of a new, modern Ukraine, which at a high price has gained its independence and the way to the future. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during an online conversation with students of universities in the UK. ""I really want people to return to their native country, to their native streets, but to a slightly different Ukraine, which has already gained independence and a future for itself. I really want this future to be mentally not in Stalin's apartments, but in the independent Ukrainian space. And at the physical level there will be large construction and restoration of our state,"" he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that it is planned to restore all residential buildings that were destroyed as a result of the Russian invasion, and such reconstruction will depend on global financial support. ""Now is the moment of truth, now is the war. And when we win, we will build our new state, not forgetting our wonderful history and our traditions,"" the President said. The President stressed that building a new, modern state is impossible without the active participation of young people who will offer their vision of the future of Ukraine. ""I can't build a comfortable state for you without you. I can build a state for all of us, for our generation, for the elderly. We can build a modern country, but it is impossible to build the future without the younger generation,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. He noted that despite the modernity and creativity, the Ukrainian authorities cannot see tomorrow as young people can. ""We cannot look ahead and see the future as transparently as you. Each generation is better than the previous one, more modern than the previous one. I can't offer you anything. I can help you realize your dreams and your Ukraine, your vision of the future,"" the President stressed. Students and professors from leading British universities, including the London School of Economics and Political Science, University of Birmingham, University of Cambridge, City, University of London, Coventry University, University of Glasgow, University of Manchester, University of Oxford, University College London, etc. took part in the meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Dear students, lecturers, professors, academics! 16 minutes 19 seconds. This is the record of The Boat Race. The legendary rowing competition on the Thames between Oxford and Cambridge. And the first Boat Race in history took place on this day, June 10, almost 200 years ago. Yes, it's just a beautiful, symbolic fact, and I'll be honest: it doesn't do much for this speech. I could compare the present in Ukraine with a difficult boat race: against the current, waves and storm, where our state is ""steering"", sails to freedom, opposes the Russian warship, and it is important for us to feel that we are not alone. That all the countries of the free world are in one boat. And Ukraine doesn't have to send an SOS signal to everyone on the 107th day of the war! I could say more, but I'll be honest: I don't want this speech to last 16 minutes 19 seconds. Although, again, I'll be honest: it had every chance to be such. Preparing for the meeting, I read a lot about the history and traditions of your educational institutions. To speak one language with you. To tell about the present of Ukraine very clearly and understandably for each and every one of you. For 107 days in a row, Ukraine and our people have heroically opposed Russian aggression. For many, our steadfastness has become a mystery and almost a miracle. Just as the Oxford Electric Bell and its design - it is still unknown exactly how it works. So is Ukraine, which for 107 days in a row has been continuously generating energy that resists the world's second army and defending itself and Europe, and if Ukraine runs out of battery, this will be a real energy crisis on the planet. For 107 days in a row we have been passing the survival exam. Every day we seem to be passing the Cambridge Tripos. On a chair with three legs, under the roar of an air-raid siren. For 107 days in a row, Ukraine has been resisting barbarians, savages, dementors. The army of ""he-who-must-not-be-named"", according to some politicians. Even more so it is inadmissible to refuse to buy oil, gas, etc. from him. For 107 days we have been facing the enemy who has not read one of the founders of the London School of Economics - Bernard Shaw. Who does not recognize the worldview that now that we have learned to fly the air like birds, swim under water like fish, we lack one thing – to learn to live on earth as human beings! The enemy who does not recognize the truth, for which the rector of the University of Birmingham, Nobel Peace Prize winner and architect of the League of Nations Robert Cecil fought. About the vital need for humanity to resolve conflicts not in the trenches, but at the table. The advantage of arguments, not missiles. For 107 days in a row, we have been opposing a state that is suffering from a new form of color blindness. It calls black white, and white black. It declares peaceful goals, but makes peaceful cities and villages its target, killing women and children, calling it self-defense. 80 years ago, Manchester survived the Christmas Blitz. This spring, the whole of Ukraine survived the Easter Blitz. 80 years ago, the Nazis razed Coventry. This year, the ruscists created dozens of new coventries in Ukraine. These are Bucha, Irpin, Borodyanka, Kharkiv, Mariupol. For 107 days in a row, we have been opposing a nuclear power that deserves the wooden spoon for ignorance of international law and the Darwin Award for violating it. As you can see, I was completely honest when I said that I was seriously preparing for our conversation. Is irony and humor appropriate on my part in such times? It can’t be otherwise. Impossible. I could cite many more analogies, quote hundreds of worthy graduates of your universities, but honestly I’d rather ask: what do you know about us? Recently, students at the University of Edinburgh exposed their professor for spreading Russian propaganda and lies while lecturing on the war in Ukraine. Excuse me for the tautology. Such news, like hundreds of other signals we see and hear from you, testify to at least three things. You are not indifferent to the war in Ukraine, lies about this war are noticeable and disgusting, but the truth is known, necessary and important. At the same time, you know the truth about Ukraine and the war. You know about Ukraine because of the war. You read about the shelling of Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Odesa, Mariupol. But did you know that these cities are sister cities of Leeds, Birmingham, Liverpool? Have you heard of the Kyivan Letter? A document of the times of Ukraine-Rus’, which is more than 1000 years old, which is stored in the Cambridge Library? About Queen Margaret, the first Saint of Scotland, granddaughter of the Grand Duke of Kyiv Yaroslav the Wise. Have you heard about the founder of Donetsk - Welsh engineer John Hughes. Or about the founder of Luhansk - Scotsman Charles Gascoigne, who built the first coal mine in Ukraine. The point is not that we have common pages of history. I'm not trying to surprise anyone with this right now. The point is that this is perhaps the best description of the essence of the war that Russia is waging against us. Its goal is to erase our history, to erase our statehood, our identity, to deny our existence as such. To say that we never existed. That we are an artificially created people, as if we are not humans, but a variety of plants or a species of animals. To devalue our culture, to humiliate our language, to cross out our art. Our musicians, writers, philosophers, scientists, designers, inventors, all the great rulers and all the great warriors of Kyivan Rus’, Zaporizhzhian Sich, who existed, exist and will exist. Russia's goal is to erase all associations about Ukraine except the war. Ukraine without the past, without the bright moments of the present, and therefore without the right to the future. Why, you may ask, is Russia doing this? Because it has a global phobia at the state level. This is a phobia of freedom. For them, this is an unfamiliar, unknown, and therefore very frightening force. Even if freedom is not in their country, but in a neighboring country. Freedom is nearby. For Russia, it is dangerously close. It wants to destroy it. But it will lose. We are fighting for our future, they are fighting for someone else's past. But the time of such countries and rulers has passed. And our time is our time, this is the future. And this is an active voice. Real voice. Voice of truth, honor, wisdom and freedom. And let's talk to you with this voice today! I do not want this speech to last 16 minutes 19 seconds. So let's finally begin! And to be honest I will be very honest. Glory to Ukraine!"
Ihor Zhovkva held a phone conversation with the State Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the Office of the Prime Minister of Slovenia,2022-06-10T20:56:00Z,"Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Ihor Zhovkva had a phone conversation with State Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the Office of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Slovenia Vojko Volk. Ihor Zhovkva thanked the Slovenian side for its humanitarian assistance and special care for the temporarily displaced Ukrainians who were forced to flee their homes as a result of Russia's military aggression and took refuge in friendly Slovenia. Discussing the issues of European integration, Ihor Zhovkva expressed conviction that Ukraine will receive the status of a candidate country for EU membership in June this year. ""Such a decision of our European friends will be a powerful manifestation of political support for Ukraine and a significant symbolic step for the entire Ukrainian people in this historic time for us,"" he said. Vojko Volk agreed with the high political weight of this step expected from the EU for Ukraine and noted that our state has the unwavering support of Slovenia in this matter. The Deputy Head of the Office of the President also shared his views on the support for granting this status to Ukraine by a number of Balkan countries, which are also moving towards EU accession. ""Ukraine is willing to learn the European integration experience of the countries of the Western Balkans region, as well as to work closely with those countries that have been the last to gain full membership in the EU so far,"" said Ihor Zhovkva. Vojko Volk expressed readiness to share with Ukraine the experience of Slovenia gained during the accession to the European Union. The Deputy Head of the Office of the President thanked the Republic of Slovenia for supporting the introduction of the sixth package of EU sanctions against Russia and informed about the need to further increase the sanctions pressure. The next, seventh package should include new sectoral sanctions in the areas of energy, finance and trade, new personal sanctions against Russian oligarchs, high-ranking government officials and heads of state-owned enterprises, as well as the elimination of all opportunities to circumvent and evade sanctions. ""Ukraine, together with its European partners, will make every effort to ensure that the aggressor bears full responsibility for its actions against our state,"" Ihor Zhovkva stressed."
Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with the Secretary of State for Defence of the United Kingdom,2022-06-10T19:21:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Secretary of State for Defence of the United Kingdom Ben Wallace, who is in Kyiv on a working visit. The President thanked the Secretary of State for Defence of the United Kingdom for the effective support for Ukraine by the British government in our fight against Russian aggression. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that Great Britain is a true friend of Ukraine. This was especially evident after the beginning of Russia's unprovoked brutal aggression against our state. ""The war has shown who our real friends and partners are. Not only strategic, but also those effective today. One of such friends is the United Kingdom,"" said the President. Volodymyr Zelenskyy informed Ben Wallace about the urgent needs of Ukraine's defense forces in terms of heavy weapons. The Head of State stressed: “Today the key priority for us is to quickly obtain heavy weapons. This is important in order to defeat the Russian aggressor, to restore the territorial integrity of Ukraine."" During the meeting, the issues of security guarantees for our state were discussed separately. An exchange of views took place on possible ways to unblock Ukrainian ports to prevent a global food crisis. For his part, Ben Wallace assured Volodymyr Zelenskyy of continuing defense support for Ukraine and stressed the importance of restoring the territorial integrity of our state."
"Olena Zelenska delivered a speech at the international conference ""Women in Conflicts""",2022-06-10T15:56:00Z,"First Lady of Ukraine Olena Zelenska took part in the online format of the conference ""Women in Conflicts"". The event took place in Brussels and was organized by the European Union together with the UN Women. The conference focuses on the situation of women at the epicenter of war, justice, and women's leadership in difficult life circumstances. The first part of the conference was held in New York on September 21, 2021. Olena Zelenska was invited to participate in the event by President of the European Council Charles Michel who has visited Ukraine several times since the beginning of the Russian invasion. During the speech, the First Lady showed photos and told the stories of Ukrainian women related to Russia's war against our state. ""I don't want to and can't talk about the war in the language of statistics and numbers. Fates are lost behind them. We already have real symbols of our war,"" said the wife of the President of Ukraine. The First Lady was joined by other female leaders, including Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili and 2018 Nobel Peace Prize winner Iraqi human rights activist Nadia Murad, a survivor of ISIS slavery and torture. She also co-organized the event. The President's wife also noted the great role of Ukrainian women in resisting the Russian invasion: “They cannot be called passive victims, each of them has her own story of resistance. Most of our doctors are women. 50% of our entrepreneurs are women, and they work to support the economy. There are 37,000 women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. More than a thousand women have already become commanders. For example, history teacher Liubov Plaksiuk is the first Ukrainian woman to lead an artillery unit and is currently fighting in Donbas. There is such a popular question: what is your superpower? So, each of our women can answer: my superpower is that I'm Ukrainian! And this is no exaggeration. Our women are superheroes who are bringing the victory closer with every day of their lives."""
Democracy can lose on the European continent if words are not backed up by action - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the Copenhagen Democracy Summit,2022-06-10T13:03:00Z,"Dear Mr. Rasmussen! Dear attendees! Dear Ladies and Gentlemen! Thank you for the opportunity to address you. Last year, at the Fourth Copenhagen Democracy Summit, the question arose as to where the frontline between freedom and oppression lies and how to protect freedom from authoritarianism. Well, this year we got the answer to this question not just in discussions, but on the battlefield. This year has shown that the state border of Ukraine is an actual line of confrontation. But between what and what? Just between freedom and oppression? Or just between democracy and authoritarianism? Yes, between them. But this confrontation can also be viewed from another point of view. It can be assessed not only in terms of political regimes or ideologies. It also needs to be looked at in terms of the ability to turn a word into action. This is the fundamental ability of any system - public, state, business. If this ability is not lacking, the system loses. Of course, we are all raised in cultures that value the word. And the democratic system is always based on the fact that the word matters. And I do not want to underestimate the importance of discussions, opinions, and positions. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that it didn't take much time for one system to turn words about a people that allegedly does not exist into brutal hostilities aimed at destroying that people. Or to turn the words that some territory is supposed to be part of another state into action to capture this territory. Can democratic systems help this nation that becomes a victim of aggression as quickly as tyranny starts aggression? Does the democratic world have the tools to defend this territory, which someone there has decided to seize, just as quickly? Last year, at a summit like this, such words could be the basis for an interesting discussion about the power of Europe and Russian tyranny. But this year we see that these are absolutely practical questions on which the fate of millions of people directly depends - and, in fact, not only in Ukraine. Because the Russian state is interested in a much larger territory than the sovereign territory of Ukraine, and Russia does not recognize the right to independent existence not only of the Ukrainian people. Ladies and Gentlemen! Let's take a closer look at some words that have not yet turned into action. The word is always the basis of the law. This is always the basis of the treaty. Conventions, statutes, declarations and, of course, memoranda. During the Russian war against Ukraine alone - and it has been going on, I will remind you, not since February 24, but since 2014 - Russia has violated about four hundred different international treaties to which our states are parties. Here are just a few examples: UN Charter; UN Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism; UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide; Corpus of conventions governing the laws and customs of war; International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance; Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict; UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. From key global documents we can move to fundamental ones for Europe. The Russian state violated: CSCE Final Act 1975; European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Statute of the Council of Europe. And we should all recall the Budapest Memorandum, the violation of which by Russia adds maximum cynicism to this picture. With this violation, Russia has put an end to the entire struggle for nuclear disarmament in the world. What is the point of talking about nuclear disarmament now that Ukraine, whose third-largest nuclear arsenal has been taken away, has been attacked by a state that was among those who signed a pledge to refrain from aggression and still remains a nuclear state? Democracy is always respect for words. International law is also respect for words. But they work and are able to win in confrontations only when they can be backed up by action. When a word literally means action. So, returning to the question of where the line of confrontation between freedom and oppression lies, it is worth saying that it also lies between the ability to simply say something and the willingness to act to reinforce certain words - promises to voters, words in negotiations and texts of conventions. On the Ukrainian border, in the Ukrainian Donbas, near Kharkiv, in the south of Ukraine, we can now see that the Ukrainian people are really ready to back up their words about independence with appropriate actions in defense of independence. But where is the frontier where it will be seen that Europe is also ready to back up all the words important for it with appropriate action? If polls show that 71 percent of Europeans consider Ukraine part of the European family, why are there still political skeptics who are hesitant to allow us to move to the European Union? If Europe's core values imply that every nation has the same importance and should be equally respected, why have the Ukrainian people been told for so long that they must remain in the gray zone between the European Union and Russia? If Russia cynically violates literally all vital documents of international law, why are there still those who are hesitant to block any relations with such a state? These questions indicate, in fact, that the European system can lose if words are not backed up by action. A democratic system can lose even on our continent if there is no action. So, first of all, we need to finally remove this gray zone, which is so tempting for the Russian state. We need to move from words that Ukraine is part of the European family to action. In the coming weeks, the European Union can take a historic step that will prove that the words about the Ukrainian people's belonging to the European family are not empty. Secondly, there is a need for effective, legally binding security guarantees in a renewed security architecture for the European continent. We are currently working on such a system of guarantees for Ukraine. And only when it appears can we say with confidence that the thousands of words on the pages of conventions, statutes, treaties and memoranda are not just words, but a reality backed up by action. We must also finally learn to act preventively. Not just to react, but to act as soon as words of aggression are heard. When it becomes clear that the war can start at any moment. The aggressor must feel the power of the democratic world, the power of international law as soon as he intends to violate the existing basic norms. And the third mandatory point is that all war criminals must always be held accountable. Justice must have its say. And the word of justice must be backed up by action. For every death inflicted in Ukraine by Russian soldiers, for every torture and rape, for every city destroyed, for the deportation of people and children, both those who did it directly and those Russian commanders and politicians who gave such orders must be held accountable. Democracy must be effective - in every sense. Europe must be effective. If words are said, if they were put on paper and became documents of international law, they must work. They must act. And when that happens, there will be no question of who will win and where this frontline is. Of course, democracy. Of course, Europe. And above all in the minds of leaders who must act, not just speak. Thank you for your attention. Glory to Ukraine!"
"Andriy Yermak met with the President of Yahad-In Unum organization, which collects evidence of Russia's war crimes in Ukraine",2022-06-10T09:15:00Z,"Head of the Office of the President Andriy Yermak met with President of Yahad-In Unum Father Patrick Desbois. The meeting included an online conference with Andriy Yermak, Patrick Desbois and representatives of the Simon Wiesenthal Center on the investigation of Russia's war crimes during the invasion of Ukraine. On behalf of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Head of the Office of the President thanked the representatives of Yahad-In Unum for their efforts to record the crimes of the Russian occupiers in Ukraine. Andriy Yermak stressed that criminals who invaded our country must be punished, and this is fundamentally important not only for Ukraine, but also for the whole world. After all, other potential aggressors must realize that evil always loses, and criminals are punished. ""In the process of this work, your experience and your efforts to gather evidence and testimony are very useful for Ukraine. We will also find the experience of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which hunted Nazis around the world, very useful. And it is extremely important for Ukraine to involve this organization in the work to bring to justice Russian war criminals,"" said the Head of the President's Office. Andriy Yermak noted that today it is necessary to document every crime committed by the Russian occupiers in Ukraine and to draw the attention of as many representatives of the international community as possible to this. The participants of the meeting stressed that humanity should have forever remembered the terrible pages of the tragedy of Babyn Yar, which took thousands of lives. However, today the Russian aggressor, who neglects not only the norms of international law, but also the basics of morality, continues to exterminate Ukrainians."
In the Ukrainian society there can be only those who defend our independence and those who work to ensure this defense - address by the President of Ukraine,2022-06-09T23:54:00Z,"Ukrainians!  All our defenders! I have recently finished a conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron. We talked primarily about defense support. Of course, this is a key topic. I informed Emmanuel about the situation on the frontline, about the possible development of confrontation in the coming days and weeks, about the intentions of the Russian occupiers and about our resistance. Of course, we talked in detail about Ukraine's European perspective. We are preparing for a response to our application for candidacy. The issues of security guarantees for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe were also touched upon. I am grateful that we discussed this topic with the President of France. We continue our work. I also spoke today with the Prime Minister of Montenegro about the path of our countries to the European Union. In fact, we exchanged experience. We continue very active work in all the countries of the European Union on a daily basis, so that the situation regarding the candidacy for our country is equally perceived there - in the west, in the east, in the north and in the south of the European Union. Most Europeans support Ukraine's integration. And if Europeans support it, politicians who are still skeptical in some countries should not oppose themselves to the people, society and the very course of European history. I addressed the participants of the ministerial meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. It is one of the most influential international organizations in the world. They severed ties with Russia. But substantial decisions are also needed - we need concrete pressure on Russia for what it is doing, including the crisis it has provoked in the world food market. I held a very important meeting with government officials today. Economy, business, jobs. We discussed actions at three levels - what needs to be done right now, what we can do in the near future, no matter how difficult it is, and what we will definitely do after the war. The first is a program of special grants to support small and medium-sized businesses. What can already provide new jobs and a new tax base. The second is the development of our security sector in all its aspects. Both now and in the future. It is also a question of jobs, a question of professionalism and technologies. The security sector in Ukraine must become completely different from what it has been all these 30 years. From the state border to every street, to every school, to every infrastructure object - security must be 100% ensured. And the third aspect is industrial recovery and attracting investment to the state. Localization, industrial parks, support of the state order, attraction of modern technologies to Ukraine. Relevant state programs are being prepared. There are many discussions in Ukraine today about what the economic policy of the state should be both during the war and when we restore peace. I want to emphasize one detail. And this detail is fundamental. We have to get used to the fact that there can be only two parts of society - those who defend our independence and those who work in a way to ensure that defense. And this is not a question of one or another economic doctrine, not a question of one or another political position. We simply cannot afford to leave the shadow part of economic life in the country. Of course, I understand that in some of our regions now, any economic activity - official or nonofficial - is a matter of mere survival. But if we talk about the normal, stable and strong life of society, the work of the state, our defense, we must understand: there are those who serve, and there are those who provide with their work those who serve. So, this is official employment. This is the payment of taxes. This is the maximum expansion of economic opportunities in our country on legal grounds. And this is a complete modernization of state institutions. Everyone who works in Ukrainian politics, who influences the public debate, should realize that there will be no more shadow in the country. I am grateful to our communication workers, who today resumed television broadcasting in Kharkiv after the morning shelling literally within a day. Striking at TV centers, destroying communication channels, leaving people in isolation - these are the tactics of the occupiers, which they really cannot do without. Because openness and honesty are also weapons against everything that the Russian state brings. The frontline situation today is without significant changes. Severodonetsk, Lysychansk and other cities in Donbas, which the occupiers now consider key targets, are holding on. We have a certain positive in the Zaporizhzhia region, where we manage to thwart the plans of the occupiers. We are gradually moving forward in the Kharkiv region, liberating our land. We are keeping defense in the Mykolaiv direction. I am grateful to all our defenders who made this possible. Thanks to which we have endured 106 days of full-scale war already. Eternal glory to all who stood up for our state! Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
"The world must remove everything that hinders cooperation and development, and Russian aggression is a key obstacle - speech by the President at the opening of the meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development",2022-06-09T14:34:00Z,"Mr. President of the Council of Ministers Mario Draghi! Mr. President! Macky Sall, Chairperson of the African Union, President of Senegal! Mr. Secretary-General Mathias Cormann! Ladies and Gentlemen! I am glad to have an opportunity to address you today. Today - when the world is in the midst of several global crises: the food crisis, the energy crisis and the crisis of values - I would use this very concept to describe a crisis that is often called geopolitical. Values. And I will explain later why this is so. A year ago - in the same summer time as now - when these three crises were being prepared, and were being prepared directly by Russia, the world did not want to see where it was heading. It did not want to see how much could depend on the development of the situation here in our part of Europe. Russia's war against Ukraine and, more broadly, Russia's aggression against all the rules of life in Europe and the world have had dire consequences. Tens of thousands of people have been killed. Hundreds of cities and villages in Ukraine have been destroyed. About 12 million people in Ukraine have become displaced persons, reflecting the biggest migrant crisis in Europe since World War II. The Black Sea, which is one of the key routes for food exports, is blocked by the Russian navy. Hundreds of millions of people on different continents are on the brink of at least food shortages and at most famine for which Russia will be fully responsible. Europe is experiencing one of the most difficult energy situations in its history... And we do not yet know what other crises Russia is preparing for the free world. What will happen if the Russian army uses weapons of mass destruction? What will happen if as a result of Russian strikes a threat will emerge, for example, to drinking water sources in our region? Or a threat of radiation or chemical pollution of the Black Sea basin, and hence parts of the Mediterranean? When Ukraine warned the world about Russian preparations last year and stressed the need for tough preventive sanctions against Russia, so that Moscow would at least feel that any aggression would not go unpunished, the world did not hear us. When we said that Russia's policy of energy conquering of Europe was aimed at creating problems not only for Ukraine - and our gas transportation system - but also for all Europeans, it was not fully perceived by some leaders in Europe itself. And when we warned that Russia's aggressive actions to block free navigation in the Sea of Azov would lead to much greater negative consequences, many in the world simply did not want to believe it and openly said that it was allegedly impossible. But all this is not just possible. That's what happened. And this is because Russia was not shown in time that the world can be tough when it comes to defending common interests. Basic interests - peace, security, freedom, free trade and predictability of life. Ladies and Gentlemen! For a long time, the world has not recognized the importance of Ukraine and the weight of our warnings. But Russia has always known that a few steps against our state, a few steps in our region - and the consequences will be felt on all continents. That is why Russia needs control over Ukraine. That is why it is the basic interest of the world now to help protect Ukraine. Russia's war against our state must end as soon as possible so that the security of food supplies across the Black Sea can be guaranteed. Because it is Ukrainian agricultural exports that play a stabilizing role in the global market. And Russia must be held accountable for provoking a new wave of migration against Europe, using the people of both Africa and Asia simply as hostages. For this, long-term painful sanctions must be applied against Russia at the global level. There can also be no question of Russia's continued membership in the FAO – the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. What has Russia to do there if it is working for starvation of at least four hundred million and at most more than a billion people? We need to guarantee Ukraine's long-term security as soon as possible so that we can guarantee Europe's long-term energy security and replace Russian fossil fuels on our continent through green energy transformation and green hydrogen. And, of course, we need to start the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine as soon as possible to ensure that none of the environmental threats posed by Russia during the war against Ukraine hit our people and neighboring nations. The Ukrainian Donbas, which Russia is simply destroying with brutal missile, air and artillery strikes, has been one of the world's most prominent industrial regions. And these are deep coal mines, metallurgical and chemical enterprises. Any hostilities in such a region - and even more so with the use of weapons now used by Russia - is a threat of pollution to a vast area. Threat of pollution of groundwater and rivers, and hence the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea. Just imagine the level of losses - for Europe and the world. Ladies and Gentlemen! At the beginning, I said that the world was in a crisis of values. In what way is it reflected? There are no such governments and countries, no international organizations that do not understand the global threats of Russian aggression. But there are governments, countries, and international organizations that believe they may sit out and not react to what is happening. This is a problem of values, not geopolitics. They talk about geopolitics when they don't want to admit that they are giving up values. I am grateful to you for remaining principled. For the fact that you are really willing to defend values. Because it is on the basis of values that sustainable development and sustainability of progress are possible. This was the right decision - when you terminated all cooperation with Russia and stopped the process of Russia's accession to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, when you closed the Organization's office in Moscow. And this should be an example for other international organizations. We must continue to use all instruments of pressure on Russia, both at the level of international organizations and at the level of countries, to stop its aggressive policy. The world must remove everything that hinders cooperation and development, and Russian aggression is the first key obstacle, the first key threat. And I believe that in the near future we will be able to begin to use in the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine all the experience of the OECD, which is based on the implementation of the historically significant Marshall Plan. I am grateful for the decision to open a regional office of the Organization in Kyiv, our capital. This is the recognition of the importance of our country, our region for global cooperation and development. And I hope, Mr. Secretary-General, Mr. Mathias, that very soon we will be able to meet with you in our Kyiv office - in the Kyiv office of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Thank you for your attention!  Glory to Ukraine!"
We must use all our influence and leadership to protect freedom and ensure the defeat of tyranny - President of Ukraine during the TIME100 Gala,2022-06-09T09:25:00Z,"Ladies and gentlemen! Greetings from Ukraine! And thank you for the opportunity to address you. When I learnt that I was named the most influential person of the year, I took it as a recognition of what all of our people are doing – all Ukrainians who are defending the freedom and independence of our state. And I am honored to be a leader, above all, for these people. Besides myself, this year's top five features Elon Musk, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson, medical workers who fought with COVID, and President of the United States Joe Biden. This ranking of the most influential is made at a time when Europe is experiencing the worst war in 77 years. The war we cannot stop yet. Why so? Why cannot we stop the bloodshed? Why is our influence not working at full capacity? And why is a person who is not on our list at all holding millions of people hostage? I believe you will agree that these questions are now literally hanging in the air. But do you have the answers? The runner-up of our top list is Elon Musk. A man who launches rockets into space and knows how to amaze the world. A man who pushes the boundaries of the possible for both intelligence and technology. But the opinions of world leaders are not focused on Elon. Not on his rockets, which ensure progress in life. Opinions of world leaders are dedicated to those who launch rockets at civilians and destroy lives. In 105 days of the full-scale war, Russia has used about 2,600 different missiles against Ukrainian cities, most of them against civilian facilities: enterprises, railways, bridges, universities, even residential buildings. One of such rockets killed three people in our city of Odesa at once: a three-month-old girl named Kira, her mother and grandmother. Three generations of one family. Kira was only a month old when Russia started a full-blown war. What did she see in her life? And what did her assassination add to Russia’s influence? At the beginning of this war, I spoke with Elon. He asked me what he could do to help. And help he did. Thanks to his technologies, we can provide our people with a stable connection even when Russian missiles destroy all infrastructure. But are there any world leaders who are worried about whether or not Elon will pick up the phone when they call him? Or, those worried whether he will accept them? Are there leaders who think about how long the table will be when Elon Musk sits down to talk to them? So what does the influence really give? What rockets? Those that serve science? Or those that serve death? Something has definitely slipped out of control. Whether it's our own influence, which we began to underestimate, or our attitude to leadership. Attitude to what it means to be a leader. I have so much respect for Boris Johnson. He is a true friend of Ukraine and a strong defender of freedom. But, unfortunately, not all depends on him whether millions of people in Africa, Asia and Latin America will have food on their tables. It is the Russian fleet – not the British one or any other – that has blocked Ukraine’s Black Sea ports so that the world is on the brink of a terrible food crisis. And it's not simply a price crisis. We cannot export our wheat, corn, vegetable oil and other products that have played a stabilizing role in the global market. This means that, unfortunately, dozens of countries may face a physical shortage of food. Millions of people may starve if Russia’s blockade of the Black Sea continues. We are constantly talking to Boris and other leaders on how to lift the Russian blockade of our ports. And how to restore the freedom of navigation – one of the basic freedoms for all humankind. But while we are looking for ways to protect freedom, another person is destroying it. Another person continues to blackmail the world with hunger. He is another in every sense of the word. Particularly, in the way this person is fighting for influence. And I have a question: why is this “otherness” still acceptable to certain leaders and countries? I leave this question to you. Because, in fact, everyone has to answer it – first of all, for themselves. To feel deep inside what is called values. Do they exist? It is only fair that the medical workers who fought against COVID have been noted this year in the Time vote. They really are the heroes of their time. And with their conscientious work, they have encouraged the whole world to unite. Finally to unite. At first, people in different countries thought that it was enough to just close the borders and provide themselves – themselves first – with the vaccine. But later it became clear that COVID-19 has no borders and cannot be dealt with only within national borders. Even the most advanced healthcare systems were not ready for the virus. And, unfortunately, had to go through a grievous injustice, fighting with COVID-19 to find a vaccine. To agree on common rules of response, a global mechanism for the distribution of vaccines. Why is this happening again? Why is it so difficult again? Weapons and sanctions are also a vaccine. A vaccine against COVID-22 brought by Russia. Hatred is a virus, and it's even more deadly than COVID-19. It is spread through propaganda. Thanks to the impunity for murderers. Thanks to Russian oil, which is still on the global market. Thanks to money that is still flowing between the global financial system and Russian banks. Thanks to the big companies, which still believe that there is still not enough blood on the money from the Russian market. Although tens of thousands of people have died and millions have been forced to flee their homes because of this war. When hatred knocks on your door, will you be ready? Will any face mask protect you from the Russian COVID-22? And why is the vaccine against it – weapons and sanctions – so difficult to get in sufficient quantities? Why do some countries pretend as if COVID-22 does not exist, just like conspiracy theorists for whom there was no COVID-19? Why do some people learn nothing even from blood and death? I am grateful to President Biden for uniting the free world when the Russian threat arose. Today we have different tools to respond. These are defense support for Ukraine, financial aid and political coordination among many countries. It is also the Lend-Lease, which brings back the meaning of the struggle for freedom that was relevant during World War II. Because the current threat is similar in scale. However, Russia’s war against Ukraine is still ongoing. And right now, as you are listening to my address, the Ukrainian military are dying on the battlefield. The Russian army is shelling our cities with artillery and aircraft. The list of children killed by Russian strikes since February 24 already includes more than two hundred and sixty names. And when will this end? In fact, this is the key question. But why is there still no answer? Why is our influence not enough for this? Are we cowards? No. Maybe we are missing something in our true strength? Maybe we are not using all the capacity of our influence and our leadership? And this is my question to the United States, both to the parties and to society; to both Democrats and Republicans; to the Congress and to the President. It is time to be one hundred percent influential. We can defeat tyranny. Indeed, every one of us – every one – is the leader of our time. We can reliably defend freedom. We can stop blackmail by a person who has no place on our list at all. If we are up to it, then we must do it. Because influence obliges us to do so. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!"
"Battle for Severodonetsk is probably one of the most difficult during this war, and in particular the fate of Donbas is being decided there - address by the President of Ukraine",2022-06-08T22:38:00Z,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! Exactly 10 years ago, this day marked the start of EURO 2012, the European Football Championship, which brought together all Ukrainians, Ukrainians and Poles, Ukrainians and the vast majority of Europeans. The opening ceremony was in Warsaw, the final ceremony was in our capital, Kyiv. The matches were hosted in different cities of our two countries and in particular in Donetsk, at the Donbas Arena. Only 10 years have passed - and it seems that it was in another world. Just today, the occupiers announced the absolutely crazy news that they are preparing to unite some football clubs from all occupied territories into one pseudo-championship - from Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Melitopol, Crimea, and even part of Georgia. It's just a mockery of the occupiers over people who remember everything well. 10 years ago our Donetsk was a strong, proud and developed city. And then Russia came. Brought ideas of just such an inadequate level. And now it is a ghost town that has lost most people, thousands of lives and absolutely all prospects. Only the return of Ukraine, which will definitely happen, only our flag and only Ukrainian law will mean a normal life for these territories, for these cities - again. The life that was there. Peaceful, safe, open to the world. And of course - new matches of world-class teams at the Donbas Arena. I am grateful to President of Poland Andrzej Duda, a friend of all Ukrainians, for the fact that he has now started a special trip to European countries to support the European perspective of our country. This June we are to get a decision on the candidacy. And all our friends, all our diplomats are now working for this, working in full. President of Slovakia Zuzana Čaputová was to go with Andrzej - such a joint initiative of the two leaders was planned. A positive COVID-19 test hindered it. Well, these are the conditions of our life now. I wish Zuzana a speedy recovery. I spoke today with German Chancellor Scholz. About the decision in favor of Ukraine on the candidacy as well, which, in fact, will be a decision in favor of Europe. We talked about defense support. And about food security, guaranteeing which is really a global interest already. Because no one can be interested, except the Russian state, in the global food crisis. I addressed today the participants of the investment conference organized to discuss the economic prospects of our state. Representatives of the world's largest funds were among the participants. Although the event was not public, it was still very important and powerful. I invited them to invest in Ukraine. Invest. I also talked to members of the community of leaders of major American companies. This is the 133rd such summit, and this year it brought together the leading forces of global business. We discussed how business can help Ukraine withstand. I urged them to leave the Russian market and not to support this war with their taxes. It is very important for me to see that such an audience - and these, I emphasize again, are representatives of the most influential part of American business - believes that sanctions against Russia should be strengthened. Therefore, it would be right for politicians to hear this position. Leading business and the majority in American and European societies believe that there is still not enough pressure on the Russian Federation to end this war. According to the results of this day, the 105th day of the full-scale war, Severodonetsk remains the epicenter of the confrontation in Donbas. We defend our positions, inflict significant losses on the enemy. This is a very fierce battle, very difficult. Probably one of the most difficult throughout this war. I am grateful to everyone who defends this direction. In many ways, the fate of our Donbas is being decided there. I also signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 285 combatants were awarded state awards, 68 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to our heroes who defend the state! Glory to Ukraine!"
Uniting the world around Ukraine will help protect democratic values - Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-06-08T21:24:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy took part in the Yale CEO Summit in a video conference mode. The event, which took place in New York this year, brought together 100 top managers of global companies, as well as leading academics from American universities, including Yale, Harvard and Columbia. The President thanked the American people, business and the state for their support of Ukraine. ""Strength is in the unification of the world. Support is the most important thing,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. According to him, it is thanks to the unification of the world community that the aggressor is being countered together, in particular through the imposition of sanctions, the provision of weapons to Ukraine, political and economic support, and so on. At the same time, the Head of State stressed that the war in Ukraine continues and the world should remember it. ""The war was not over after driving the Russian troops out of the Kyiv region and some other occupied areas. Fighting continues in the east. As long as they are on our territory, this war is for freedom, for sovereignty, for the principles of international law and for democracy. It is very important for us not only to talk about this, but also to ensure that these words lead to concrete conclusions,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. During the Q&A session, the President was asked what the owners of global companies, including American ones, could do to help Ukraine now and during the post-war recovery. The Head of State noted that first of all, representatives of the world business community will help if their companies finally leave the market of the aggressor country and work to weaken Russia by continuing to impose effective tough sanctions. ""This is our common war. Companies that are in the market of the Russian Federation must leave, and leave fully. The most important thing for us is that their taxes will not finance the weapons with which the Russians are killing us,"" the President of Ukraine stressed. Instead, according to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, these businesses can find a place in the Ukrainian economy. By opening their offices in our country, international companies will support the Ukrainian economy and create jobs for citizens who lost their jobs and homes due to the war. According to the President, only a strong Ukraine and a real union of world leaders, including the United States, Canada, the EU, Australia, countries of Africa and Asia, can force Russia and President Vladimir Putin to move to real negotiations to end the war. ""If we want to defend the principles of democracy today, the principles of civilization, we must defend Ukraine. Defend by both the timely supply of weapons and sanctions,"" said the President. He noted that the missiles that Russia uses against Ukraine have shown that the distance between the countries is conditional, and Russian weapons can cause destruction and casualties anywhere on the planet. ""One country cannot dictate conditions to the whole world. If Ukraine does not withstand it, then, believe me, Poland, the Baltic countries, Europe will be next. The appetite of this state, which has violated international law and our territorial integrity, is huge. It has the same appetite in business, without any market laws. They will start dictating conditions to you, too: how to do business, with whom to do business, with which states you can cooperate and with which you cannot,” the President of Ukraine warned. Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for assistance in resolving the issue of unblocking Ukrainian ports so that Ukraine could export grain to prevent the global food crisis and famine in many countries. The President also called on the leading scientific and business community to join the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine, which he believes will be a powerful economic project. And today each of the companies can support our state through the fundraising platform UNITED24. At the end of the meeting, the organizers announced the awarding of Volodymyr Zelenskyy with the Legend in Leadership Award. This award honors world leaders who leave an inspiring legacy, showed heroism and influenced cultures, industries or countries. Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked for this award and noted that he perceived it as an award for the entire Ukrainian people. Serhiy Kyslytsya, Permanent Representative of Ukraine to the United Nations, received the award for the Head of State in New York."
"Political history always goes alongside economic one, and success can be common only - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's address to the participants of Ukraine Virtual Investor Conference",2022-06-08T17:46:00Z,"Ladies and Gentlemen! Thank you for the invitation! Glad to be able to address you today. I know that business people will listen to me, not politicians, so I will be as specific as possible. So that both your time and my time are used to maximum advantage. Ukraine has been subjected to an unprovoked and extremely brutal full-scale attack on our land by the Russian Federation. This war has been going on for 105 days already. And we are waging this war in such a way that, I am sure, no one has any doubts about our victory anymore. It will definitely be achieved. And the more qualitative our cooperation is, the faster it will happen. I offer you to consider today two horizons of cooperation with Ukraine - short-term and long-term. Of course, you can join our success story. Join our victory. Just now. These are very simple, very transparent tools. The first tool is our United24 platform, a special fundraising platform with which we accumulate funds to restore life after hostilities. This is demining, this is the purchase of equipment for hospitals, humanitarian support. This is very important. Each contribution gives us the opportunity to see that Ukraine has one or another specific but true friend. Hence, we see who we will be grateful to. The second tool is Ukraine's military bonds. Even now, during a full-scale war, we are demonstrating absolutely conscientious service of our debt. So, military bonds are a tool for you to support us in the fight for freedom and to make money. Make money for you. But I still want to pay more attention to the long-term horizon today. To the reasons why it will be profitable for you to cooperate with Ukraine not just now, but now and for many more years to come. I offer you to see it in the long run as they say. What exactly are these opportunities? I will name five main ones: Europe, IT, agriculture, green energy, localization of production. Ukraine is access to the entire market of the European Union. Duty free access. We are working to ensure the same access to the G7 markets. And this is our own market, one of the largest in our region. Ukraine is qualified hard-working specialists, one of the best in Europe. Ukraine is a space of digitization that gives simplicity, gives, most importantly, transparency to any relationship between person and state, between company and state. This is something you will not find today in most countries of the world. Ukraine is an IT sector that enjoys one of the most favorable legislations in the world - a special legislative regime ""Diia City"". And I propose to move the headquarters of IT companies to Ukraine, to create joint service centers and R&D centers. Ukraine is resilient institutions even during a full-scale invasion. Our banking system, finances, government agencies remain absolutely stable, working in spite of everything. Ukraine is an agricultural sector whose global significance has already been seen by all when Russia blocked our ports. It is our agricultural sector that is key to the markets of dozens of countries. It is really profitable to develop processing in Ukraine. Ukraine is industrial parks that provide special opportunities for any manufacturing enterprise. Huge potential in various industries, from aerospace to woodworking. Ukraine is rich in natural resources, from natural gas to lithium ores. And Ukraine is green energy, green fertilizers and green hydrogen. All this together is a guarantee of Europe's future energy security when we replace Russia with its dirty fossil fuels. Ukraine is an ambitious program of post-war reconstruction, which will be the largest economic project in Europe of our time. All of these are priorities for me, so they can become priorities for you as well. Nowhere in the world will you find all these economic factors at once. They are only here, in Ukraine, and you can already join the work with them. And, of course, I understand that next to everything I say now, there is one word. And this is the word ""war"". The war continues. But we withstood a powerful blow. We defend our territory. And we are moving towards one of the greatest military successes in Europe. We will win this war. And working with you, it will happen faster. Political history always goes alongside economic one, and when success is possible, it can be common only - both at the state level and at the business level. We offer you just such a success. Because we feel that our defense in this war and our work for the victory have shown everyone in the world that we really deserve success. I invite you to cooperate! Glory to Ukraine!"
"We must prepare for the next heating season, which due to the aggression of the Russian Federation will be the most difficult since independence - address by the President of Ukraine",2022-06-07T23:59:00Z,"Good health to you! A brief report on the past day. There were many activities - both diplomatic and domestic. First, the government is setting up a headquarters to prepare for the next heating season. This decision was made as a result of a meeting I held today with both government officials and representatives of our largest state-owned energy companies and regulators. Prime Minister, Ministers of Energy, Economy, Minister for Communities and Territories Development, heads of Naftogaz, Ukrenergo, Energoatom and the National Commission for State Regulation of Energy and Utilities. The relevant Deputy Head of the Office of the President was also present. Whatever the occupiers plan for themselves, we must prepare for the next winter - in our state, on our land, for all citizens. The issues of purchasing a sufficient amount of gas for the heating season, coal accumulation, and electricity production were discussed today. In the current situation due to Russia's aggression, this will indeed be the most difficult winter of all the years of independence. But! Everything is alright. We must go through it so that our people feel the normal work of the state. At this time, we will not be selling our gas and coal abroad. All domestic production will be directed to the internal needs of our citizens. At the same time, we are doing everything we can to increase our electricity export capabilities. This will be made possible by the capacities available in Ukraine. And after the historical accession of our country to the unified energy network of Europe, such exports not only allow us to increase our foreign exchange earnings, but also directly influence the stabilization of the energy situation in neighboring countries, which reduce Russian energy consumption. Another important aspect is the repair program for thermal power plants, combined heat and power plants and boiler houses. In particular, for those who were damaged or completely destroyed by Russian strikes. Implementation of this program in the coming months is one of the top tasks for the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine. I would like to emphasize that I have set a very specific task for the government to do everything possible to ensure that gas and electricity tariffs do not change in the next heating season. People already face enough difficulties because of the war. This will be provided. Local authorities are responsible for tariffs for heat and hot water, and the same level of tariffs should be ensured at the local level in the winter of 2022-2023 as well. I also held a meeting on communication with the European Union and with individual EU member states on our application and candidate status. Diplomatic activity in this direction does not stop even for a day. I hear daily reports, including on the preparation of procedural decisions in the European Union. The team of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, our diplomats, the team of the government in general - all, absolutely all are working to achieve a significant historical decision already in June, which we all expect. For its part, Ukraine has done all, absolutely all the necessary work for this. As they say in such cases: the ball is in the court of European structures, European countries. The frontline situation in Ukraine has not changed significantly over the past 24 hours. The absolutely heroic defense of Donbas continues. The hottest spots are the same. First of all, Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Popasna. It is felt, absolutely felt, that the occupiers did not believe that the resistance of our military would be so strong, and now they are trying to attract additional resources in the Donbas direction. Just as in the Kherson direction – new units are being transferred there to restrain our actions. But what's the point for them? The majority of the occupying contingent is already well aware that they have no prospects in Ukraine. We hear this mood in the appropriate interceptions of conversations. This is the prevailing mood in the Russian army. We are free people. We are not your slaves. More than 31,000 Russian servicemen have already died in Ukraine. Since February 24, Russia has been paying almost 300 lives a day for a completely pointless war against Ukraine. And still the day will come when the number of losses, even for Russia, will exceed the permissible limit. We are actively working to raise funds to support our army and to rebuild Ukraine after hostilities. In the territories that are already de-occupied, we return electricity, gas, water supply, communications. It's not easy, but we do it. Of course, much remains to be done. It is necessary to provide hospitals with equipment, carry out demining. And, of course, rebuild everything destroyed by the occupiers. One of the tools for this is the state fundraising platform UNITED24. In the first month alone, more than one and a half billion hryvnias have been raised with its help. And I am grateful to everyone who contributed to its creation, to its work. Today, Elina Svitolina, our famous and very successful tennis player, became the ambassador of UNITED24. Together with Andriy Shevchenko, the first UNITED24 ambassador, Elina will work to attract new support for our country. Everything for Ukraine. This way, working together, each of us will be able to return normal life to all territories to which our military has returned security. And another piece of news that can be reported now. Next week, a special ""Book of Torturers"" is planned to be launched - an information system that collects confirmed data on war criminals and criminals from the Russian army. I have repeatedly stressed that they will all be held accountable. And we are approaching this step by step. The creation of such an information system has been going on for some time already. These are specific facts about specific people who are guilty of specific violent crimes against Ukrainians. And such a ""Book of Torturers"" is one of the foundations of the responsibility of not only the direct perpetrators of war crimes - soldiers of the occupying army, but also their commanders. Those who gave orders. Those who made possible everything they did in Ukraine. In Bucha, in Mariupol, in all our cities, in all the communities they have reached. Everyone will be brought to justice. Eternal memory to all whose lives were taken by these occupiers! Eternal glory to everyone who is bringing our victory closer! Glory to Ukraine!"
Famous Ukrainian tennis player Elina Svitolina became a UNITED24 ambassador,2022-06-07T22:58:00Z,"Titled tennis player, Elina Svitolina, has become the second ambassador for UNITED24, a fundraising platform initiated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The ambassador was introduced during a zoom call with the President of Ukraine, Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov, and platform coordinator Yaroslava Gres. The first UNITED24 ambassador, Andriy Shevchenko, also joined the meeting. Together with Andriy Shevchenko, Elina Svitolina will work on uniting the world's sporting community in support of Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked Elina Svitolina for the active stance she has taken since the first days of the war, and emphasized how important it is to raise awareness about Ukraine. “For the attention to Ukraine not to reduce, we must actively tell people from other countries about us. That is why UNITED24’s key goals are both fundraising and raising awareness about Ukraine and our fight for freedom,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Since the first days of the full-scale Russian aggression against Ukraine, Elina Svitolina has refused to participate in any competitions against athletes from Russia and Belarus. At the same time, Svitolina became a loud voice of Ukraine on the world stage. “Every time I won on the court, I was happy to bring victory to my country. I have always been proud to be Ukrainian. Today, when my country is facing a horrific enemy, I will not stand aside. I will do my best to help Ukraine win its most important fight. I am honored to become part of UNITED24 and join efforts with the President of Ukraine,” Elina Svitolina noted.  A charity match featuring world No.1, Iga Świątek, is planned under the patronage of Elina Svitolina for the end of July.  During the first four weeks of UNITED24 activity, more than $52.5 million was collected to cover Ukraine’s needs. "
Andriy Yermak met with G7 ambassadors,2022-06-07T20:53:00Z,"Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak met with the ambassadors of the G7 countries. He informed the heads of diplomatic missions about the results of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to the frontline positions of the Ukrainian troops. Emphasizing that the Armed Forces of Ukraine have a high morale and motivation, Andriy Yermak drew attention to the quantitative advantage of the Russian aggressor in armaments and military equipment. He called on the ambassadors of the G7 countries to assist in speeding up the supply of the necessary weapons by the governments of their countries for the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This should speed up Ukraine's victory in this brutal, unprovoked war unleashed by Russia. ""We have a clear understanding that victory for us means the full restoration of Ukraine's territorial integrity,"" said the Head of the President's Office. He suggested intensifying work to raise awareness of partners about the defense needs of our country, in particular by holding regular briefings for military experts of interested countries, organizing visits of journalists to the front and more. During the meeting the issue of post-war reconstruction of our state was discussed. Andriy Yermak informed about the initiative of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which envisages taking patronage over individual cities or regions of Ukraine by partner countries with ensuring full control over the use of financial resources. The G7 countries were invited to actively participate in this initiative. Andriy Yermak informed about the results of the expert group's work on making recommendations on imposing sanctions against the aggressor, as well as on the state of formation of two more advisory groups - on post-war security guarantees for Ukraine and on reparations. The importance of ensuring progress on Ukraine's path to membership in the European Union was emphasized. The most important at this stage should be the decision of EU leaders at the European Council session on June 24 to grant Ukraine candidate status. The participants of the meeting exchanged views on ways to restore full-fledged exports of Ukrainian grain, in particular through the Black Sea ports of our country. The parties agreed on the importance of holding regular briefings for G7 ambassadors, in particular with the participation of senior government officials, in order to exchange views on topical issues of domestic and foreign policy agenda."
It would be appropriate to continue providing financial assistance to Ukrainian refugees from allied countries even after their return to Ukraine - Oleg Ustenko,2022-06-07T19:03:00Z,"The financial resources provided by the EU, the United States and other allies of Ukraine to support our citizens fleeing Russian aggression in other countries should be used to encourage these refugees to return home. This is stated in a joint article by adviser to the President of Ukraine on economic issues Oleg Ustenko and professor at MIT Sloan and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund Simon Johnson for the American newspaper Los Angeles Times. “More than 6.5 million Ukrainians escaped the country and found amazing support in neighboring countries, including EU countries, as well as non-EU countries such as Moldova and Norway. Taking care of refugees is expensive — they need food, shelter, schooling, healthcare and other services. Many countries have also provided daily cash allowances,” the article reads. Although part of this cost has been borne by philanthropists, the budgetary cost to EU governments is at least 60 billion euros per year (about 10,000 euros per person), as stated by the authors. Some Ukrainian refugees, in particular IT specialists, continue working remotely even while outside Ukraine. Hence, they are able to earn income and support our economy. But many jobs in Ukraine still do not provide opportunities for remote work. “Overall, on its current course, the economy is likely to decline by at least 40% this year compared with 2021 and, until the refugees return home, a sustained recovery is hard to achieve,” the authors predict. According to the article, as of now, 30,000 people are returning to Ukraine every day. They can be productively employed to rebuild and repair the economy, but the government is hard-pressed to support them and their wages. The government budget is already running a monthly deficit of around 5 billion euros to cover war-related spending. “That's why it would make sense to have some of the EU financial support for refugees made available to them when they return to Ukraine,” the authors emphasize. Oleg Ustenko and Simon Johnson name three possible ways to implement such support. “One approach is to let refugees bring their cash benefits back with them to Ukraine for a limited period, such as six months. Another is to provide additional resources to the Ukrainian government to hire more people for rebuilding work,” the article reads. Both these policies will pull more refugees home, but the process may be slow. According to the experts, easier and more effective would be for the Ukrainian government to use this funding, received from the EU, to create a temporary basic income program for all Ukrainians in the country.  “A modest cash grant program would help millions now struggling to feed their families stay in their communities and increase economic activity,” Oleg Ustenko and Simon Johnson noted. According to them, if half of the more than 6 million Ukrainian refugees were to return home, European governments could significantly reduce their refugee spending and redirect tens of billions of euros into uses that would have long-term benefits for Ukraine. Any such program could be wound down as Russian forces are expelled from Ukrainian territory and the economy stabilizes. “We don’t know how long this war will last. The devastation wrought by Russia’s invasion remains incalculable. Eventually, Ukraine, a country of around 40 million, will need international assistance and support to rebuild. Shoring up its economy and beginning that process should start now,” the authors conclude."
"Ukraine's success in war with aggressor depends not only on unity of people, but also on weapons, sanctions and political support of the West - President",2022-06-07T17:02:00Z,"Ukraine's further success in the war against the Russian aggressor and the deoccupation of territories depend not only on the unity of the Ukrainian people and the strength of the Armed Forces, but also on the weapons supplied to us by partner states, political support and consistent Western sanctions policy. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an interview with Financial Times Editor Roula Khalaf. ""The advancement, the deoccupation of our territories depends on powerful weapons, political support from the West and a clear, strong sanctions policy. It depends not only on the unity of our people, government and the Armed Forces of Ukraine,"" the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that the deoccupation of Ukrainian settlements has been slowing down recently, and in some places there is a threat of an offensive by Russian troops. To win on the battlefield, Ukraine needs powerful military equipment, which is not inferior to that of the enemy forces, the President stressed. ""We have greater desire (to win - ed.), but less technology. Therefore, we cannot advance powerfully. This is an extremely important position, a way out of the stalemate,"" he said. According to the Head of State, the strong interest of Western countries in supporting Ukraine's sovereignty is of great importance. ""There can be no discussions, agreements without Ukraine, behind our backs. There can be no expectation from certain leaders of some countries that we will weaken our position. Like, we have to wait, they will be exhausted economically, infrastructurally, they will have a shortage of money, a shortage of fuel, and then, as they say, Ukraine will be compliant,” said the President. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that some Western countries are trying to undertake the role of mediator in the negotiations between Ukraine and Russia and at the same time are looking for ways to continue doing business with the Russian side. ""Everyone is acting like a sapper. Supporting Ukraine, they are checking: what else can be done to mitigate sanctions a little so that the business of one or another state does not suffer. And constantly, like sappers, they are trying to push this or that initiative,"" he said. The Head of State noted that Ukraine does not need solutions alternative to those already chosen and supported by most countries of the civilized world. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that our state pays considerable attention to the sanctions policy against the aggressor. ""We believe that sanctions are a powerful weapon - a weapon without blood. It is an economical modern weapon. Therefore, I want it not to be just a phrase ""Sanctions against Russia do not work."" They work when they are specifically implemented and when we all do not allow to bypass them,"" the President stressed. The Head of State reiterated that Russia had blocked Ukrainian ports, which made it impossible for Ukraine to export wheat, barley, sunflower, etc. According to him, the blockade of exports of domestic agricultural products could lead to world hunger and exacerbate the migrant crisis. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian side offered an option to provide a corridor with the participation of partner countries, but not Russia. ""Everyone knows very well that we will not let Russian ships into our ports, because they attack us every day. But Ukraine is ready to export what it has. We are ready for normal, civilized conditions, safe conditions,"" he stressed. The President noted that Russia's aggressive war against Ukraine is a global problem. ""Don't forget that this war is still going on. And there can be no fatigue in Western countries from it. I urge you… Don't forget about it. Do everything you can,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged. He also thanked the United Kingdom and personally Prime Minister Boris Johnson for supporting Ukraine and expressed hope for continued strategic cooperation. The Head of State stressed that our country is interested in the unity of the world, including China, in order to influence Russia and stop the war."
"The world should not get used to Russia's war against Ukraine, otherwise it will never end - Olena Zelenska in an interview for the American TV channel ABC",2022-06-07T10:22:00Z,"First Lady Olena Zelenska called on the world, and in particular the United States, not to get used to Russia's war against Ukraine, because if that happens, the war will never end. The President's wife stated this in an interview for the American TV channel ABC, which she gave in Kyiv. The conversation was interrupted for 40 minutes by an air alarm - this episode was also seen by American viewers. ""I really want the whole world, and Americans as well, not to get used to this war. Yes, it is far from you, it lasts long, and you can get tired of it, but please do not get used to it, because if everyone gets used to it, this war will never end. Don't get used to the pain. And when you start thinking that there may be some reason for this war, it means that you are in the zone of Russian propaganda. Be careful, hear the truth,"" she said. Olena Zelenska also stressed that Ukraine is not ready to give up its territories in exchange for ""peace"", as some Russian and world politicians suggest: ""We are not ready to give up our territories. You can't lose your territory and be calm in the future. The aggressor will not stop at part of our territory, they will not stop until they destroy us. So we have no choice - we must fight for our independence."" The First Lady is convinced that Ukrainians will endure this war. But today our citizens are experiencing terrible tragedies. ""There are children who have seen their parents being killed. Here, in the Kyiv region, for example, there are boys who saw their mother killed and had to bury her themselves,” she said. According to the President's wife, Russian soldiers are resorting to destruction and violence, because Russia's goal is to ""destroy everything that makes us Ukrainians and distinguishes us from them."" The First Lady also spoke about the National Program of Psychological Assistance to War Victims, which was launched at her initiative. ""The big problem is that Ukrainians are not used to consulting a psychologist, so we need a large-scale communication campaign,"" she said. In addition, Olena Zelenska noted the great role of Ukrainian women in this war, each of whom does her best for the victory: “I have always been convinced that Ukrainian women are the best. And finally the world will see the face of a Ukrainian woman."""
Andriy Yermak met with the parliamentary delegation of the Republic of Korea,2022-06-07T09:50:00Z,"Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak met with the parliamentary delegation of the Republic of Korea headed by Leader of the ruling People Power Party Lee Jun-seok. At the beginning of the event, Andriy Yermak stressed the importance of the Korean delegation's visit to Ukraine at this crucial time for our country, and thanked for Korea's consistent support for Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty. The Head of the President's Office noted that today our country's main task is to win this unprovoked war started by Russia. According to Andriy Yermak, Ukraine's goal is to achieve peace as soon as possible, because the longer the war lasts, the greater the risks for the whole world. At the same time, he stressed that our country especially needs military assistance to win. ""We are confident that this will be our victory and the victory of our friends and partners,"" said the Head of the President's Office. During the meeting, the parties noted the importance of the fact that the high-level Korean delegation saw the situation in Ukraine personally, as well as visited Bucha and Irpin, where it had an opportunity to see the consequences of horrific war crimes committed by Russian invaders. This visit and its results will also help identify key areas for further deepening cooperation between the two countries, in particular during the reconstruction of Ukraine's regions, which have suffered enormous damage as a result of the war. In this context, Andriy Yermak announced the initiative of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to invite democracies to take patronage over a region or a city in Ukraine that needs to be restored, and invited the Korean side to join this ambitious project. The Head of the Office of the President and the delegation of the Republic of Korea also discussed some promising areas of post-war cooperation, in particular in the field of innovative automotive industry. Andriy Yermak suggested discussing these and other potentially interesting joint projects during a video conference with members of the government and business representatives of the two countries. Separately, Andriy Yermak touched upon the issue of work carried out by the Ukrainian side together with partners in the development of a multilateral agreement on security guarantees for Ukraine."
Everyone should talk about what is happening in Ukraine so that the attention to our struggle for freedom is not decreased - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-06-06T23:58:00Z,"Ukrainians! Good health to you! Today was a busy day. A day of important communication, important meetings. I congratulated the journalists on their professional holiday. During the war, the word ""holiday"" sounds very unnatural, but every year on this day, June 6, greetings are heard for the people on whom, of course, we all depend. On the information they spread. On the speed at which they work. Of course, we do not celebrate this year. But still, we congratulate them. We still note the contribution of journalists of Ukraine and all those on whom the work of the media depends: cameramen, engineers, editors, photographers, producers and everyone without whom broadcast is impossible and websites will not work. These are the people who keep the information front and to whom I am grateful for this on behalf of all of us, all Ukrainians. Today I awarded correspondents and media workers who are working on the battlefield now. I also presented awards to the relatives of those whose lives were taken by the war. 32 media workers have been killed since February 24. This list includes different biographies, different personal stories. And not only citizens of Ukraine. Today, during a special ceremony in the President's Office, everyone was remembered. Their memory was honored with a moment of silence. I spoke today with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson. I informed him about the situation on the battlefield, about our capabilities and key current dangers, especially in Donbas and in the southern regions of Ukraine. I am grateful to Prime Minister Boris Johnson for fully understanding our needs and for his willingness to provide Ukraine with the weapons we so desperately need to protect the lives of our people. I also spoke with Polish President Andrzej Duda. Of course, about defense support for Ukraine. This is a mandatory topic for each of my negotiations. And I am grateful to our partners who act quickly and do not postpone their decisions. I am grateful to Poland. The issue of candidate status for Ukraine was also discussed with Andrzej, which is a key political issue right now. We are waiting for the decision of the European Union on our application in the coming weeks. I believe that this will be a decision not only about Ukraine, but also about the entire European project. About whether it has a future as a really strong union. I am preparing for a new wave of appeals and communication with the political and expert communities of the world in order to guarantee our state the support we so desperately need. This is a constant process - the maintenance of attention, and it cannot be stopped for a single moment. And that applies to everyone, really. Every modern person is well aware of how the media works. It is very difficult to keep an eye on one topic for a long time. For the attention to Ukraine, to our struggle for freedom not to decrease, everyone must continue to talk about what is happening. Please share information. Support our needs. Of course, this primarily applies to journalists. And today, by the way, I want to wish them not to be locked on our internal Ukrainian context. The more we say about Ukraine in the world, the sooner we will be able to end the war and liberate our land. Of course, this applies to all representatives of the state and Ukrainian politics. Work for our defense - in unity and in full force. But do not forget that business, culture and ordinary people can also do a lot to keep Ukraine at the top of global attention. A simple example - today I was presented with postage stamps issued in Spain in support of Ukraine. It may seem that the postage stamp can't change anything. But it is a symbol of the attention to our struggle that millions of people will see. Creating such symbols, encouraging the creation of such symbols, talking about Ukraine and encouraging talks about Ukraine - this is what will help us in negotiations with representatives of states on specific important assistance that Ukraine needs today. Our heroes hold their positions in Severodonetsk. Fierce street fights continue in the city. Lysychansk, Slovyansk, Bakhmut, Sviatohirya, Avdiivka, Kurakhove and other directions of Russian strikes are the hottest points of confrontation today. The Russian army is trying to use additional forces in the Donbas direction, but it is the 103rd day - and the Ukrainian Donbas stands. It stands firmly. We do everything for the defense in the Zaporizhzhia and Mykolaiv directions as well. I am grateful to everyone who endures the strong pressure of the occupiers and defends our state. 17,864 combatants have been awarded state awards of Ukraine since February 24. This number 100% demonstrates the scale of our people's heroism that became the response to Russia's full-scale invasion. I signed a new decree today on awarding our military. 121 warriors were awarded, 32 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"
"Ukraine is negotiating with a number of countries on the export of grain from ports, but weapons remain the main guarantor in this matter - President",2022-06-06T21:06:00Z,"Ukraine is negotiating with a number of countries and with the United Nations to unblock ports for the unimpeded export of grain, but weapons we receive from partner countries remain the main guarantor in this matter. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a conversation with media representatives on the occasion of Journalist's Day. ""It is important for us that we are ready to export grain. We now have Russia's information narrative that food shortages are due to Ukraine, due to the fact that we do not export. This is untrue, and you know it very well,"" the President said. The President stressed that Russia is trying to spread this lie in Africa, Asia and Europe, where there may be a problem of food shortages. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that he had discussed the issue of unblocking Ukrainian ports with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. ""We need a safety corridor for ships. So that the fleet of this or that state ensures the export of this grain. And we talked to both Britain and Turkey. Turkey is now finding a format on how to provide us with guarantees,"" the Ukrainian Head of State said. According to him, the representatives of Turkey and Russia during the meeting in Ankara may raise the issue of security guarantees for the Turkish fleet during the export of Ukrainian grain. The President also noted that Ukraine is considering alternative ways to export grain. ""There are several options for exporting our grain. We are negotiating with close countries, with the Baltic countries, with Poland on the export of small volumes by Ukrzaliznytsia. But this is not a good option for either us or them. And the risks of a deficit may remain due to the long export time,"" the President said. The President stressed that ports remain a priority for the transportation of Ukrainian grain. ""We can export it very quickly. If now we have 22-25 million tons blocked, then in the autumn we may already have 75 million tons. What are we going to do then? That's why we can't do without ports,"" he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that the most powerful guarantee in this matter is the weapons that will be placed to unblock the water corridors for the export of grain. ""We are working on this with specific countries, on specific anti-ship systems, and we are already gradually getting them - I can say that. I think this is the best guarantee,"" the President said. The Head of State stressed that Ukraine uses these weapons not for threats, but to demonstrate the ability to respond quickly to possible provocations by Russia. ""I see no more guarantees, except for the countries, the UN and our weapons concentrated near these corridors,"" summed up Volodymyr Zelenskyy."
"Main Intelligence Directorate deals with the issue of returning servicemen who left the Azovstal plant, and it must provide the result - Head of State ",2022-06-06T19:16:00Z,"Negotiations on the exchange of prisoners between Ukraine and Russia, including the military who left the Azovstal plant in Mariupol, are being conducted by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, whose task is to return Ukrainian citizens home. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a conversation with media representatives on the occasion of Journalist's Day. The Head of State noted that an appropriate joint body has been set up on the basis of the Main Intelligence Directorate, which is responsible for all issues of war prisoners. ""We know what can be agreed on with the Russians, we know this price. We know they can't be trusted. The Main Intelligence Directorate must deal with this issue and provide the result. The only result is to bring people home,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. According to the President, the Main Intelligence Directorate has fulfilled the first part of the task - bringing people out of the plant alive. ""Today there is the second part - to bring them home alive. This mission does not consist of these two steps,"" the Head of State stated. According to him, the representatives of the directorate are the specialists who should work on the liberation of these prisoners, as they have proved their professionalism during a number of important operations. ""That's why I trust them personally, and we expect results from them,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy, adding that this task is not easy. The Head of State also noted that there may be more than 2,500 prisoners from Azovstal on the territory of certain districts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Regarding the treatment of these prisoners, including the intention to hold a so-called public tribunal, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was not ready to comment on the plans of the Russians, as they are constantly changing them, and many people organize PR for themselves on this issue. As for whether these people are being tortured, the President is convinced that it is not in the interests of the Russian side to do so, because they are ""public prisoners"" whose condition is monitored by the world community."
"Volodymyr Zelenskyy: As the President of a warring state, I have one priority - to turn war into our victory",2022-06-06T18:49:00Z,"The war with the Russian aggressor continues, and we shouldn't prepare the enemy, telling where and how many servicemen and equipment we have; at the same time, Ukrainian society and the international community need to know the truth about what is happening on the front, who is killing and torturing whom. This was emphasized by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a conversation with media representatives on the occasion of the Journalist's Day. According to the Head of State, the situation in the east is difficult, which he personally saw when he visited the frontline positions of Ukrainian troops in the Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions yesterday. ""We are keeping the situation in the Severodonetsk direction. There are more of them (the enemy - ed.), they are more powerful, but we have every chance to fight in this direction,"" the President said. He noted that 10-15% of the population remained in Severodonetsk. The situation is similar in Lysychansk, Luhansk region. Asked whether it would be more appropriate to withdraw Ukrainian forces from Severodonetsk to better positions, the President said that returning to these positions could be more expensive in terms of losses. According to him, decisions on Severodonetsk will be made depending on the development of the situation, now it is not easy, but the Ukrainian military is holding its positions. ""As for Zaporizhzhia, the situation there is the most threatening, because part (of the region - ed.) is occupied, and the enemy constantly wants to occupy Zaporizhzhia,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. In the Kharkiv direction, according to the Head of State, Ukrainian troops are gradually de-occupying villages. The President stressed that the war in Ukraine continues, and it is important to tell the truth about the heroism of our soldiers and the cruelty of the enemy in the information space, not to reveal the secrets of Ukrainian defenders. ""As the President of a warring state, my only priority is war and how to turn war into peace, into our victory. I do absolutely everything for this,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. He noted that he sees no problems with freedom of speech in Ukraine, despite the martial law. ""I am interested in the unity of journalists around the main victory, not around one person or another, but around saving hundreds of thousands of our people,"" the President stressed. The Head of State stressed that information weapons are powerful, and it is important ""for them to be directed not against us, but against the enemy."" According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, uniting Ukrainian TV channels in the format of a telethon was the right decision. ""What can be said is only said by the military and the President… Journalists, bloggers, even the President cannot talk about some things on the air so that the army remains strong and its secrets are not known to everyone,"" he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy added that the military officials who comment on the course of hostilities are responsible for the information they provide and understand what could be made public and what could not so as not to help the enemy. At the same time, the President noted that the media play an important role in bringing the truth to society and the international community. ""We are interested in the truth. The sincere truth about what is happening, who is killing whom, who is torturing people, and not what the Ukrainian army is shooting with. We should not prepare the enemy by telling where our drones are, how many of them we have, what hangar, when they take off, when they land. People and weapons are very expensive,"" he said. The Head of State stressed that it was not about the specific names of journalists, but about the format of admission to the frontline."
President presented state awards to media workers and family members of deceased journalists on Journalist's Day,2022-06-06T17:18:00Z,"On the occasion of the Journalist's Day, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy presented state awards to Ukrainian media workers and family members of media representatives who died as a result of a full-scale Russian invasion. The President expressed gratitude to all journalists who during the 103 days of this invasion and the eight years of the Russian Federation's war against Ukraine talentedly, humanely and sincerely performed their work. ""I do not want to say too many words and take your time. I think journalists know best what the price of words and the price of time is. Especially at this difficult time for our state - the time of war,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The President thanked the journalists who, like the Armed Forces and the entire Ukrainian people, defend our state and bring the truth to the people. ""You bring the truth and important information - very powerful, important meanings that can be a great advantage for our country in this fight, in which we will definitely win,"" he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy presented state awards for significant contribution to the development of journalism, high professionalism and conscientious work. The President also noted that since February 24, 32 Ukrainian and foreign media workers have been killed as a result of Russia's armed aggression in Ukraine. The President mentioned each of them by name; the attendees honored their memory with a moment of silence."
The Yermak-McFaul International Group presented a Roadmap for individual sanctions.,2022-06-06T10:48:00Z,"The Yermak-McFaul International Working Group on Sanctions against Russia presented a Roadmap for individual sanctions. The document defines the objectives of individual sanctions, the principles of their application, comprehensively names all categories of persons against whom personal sanctions should be imposed, and proposes a strategy to increase sanctions pressure. The purpose of individual sanctions is to increase pressure on the ruling elites of the regime, and thus help end the war against Ukraine. The Group proposes to impose sanctions on those categories of persons for whom it will be the fastest and most effective. That is, it is proposed to choose those categories of persons, personal sanctions of the democratic world against which will be the most painful. The following types of persons subject to sanctions are offered in order of priority: oligarchs, senior government officials, key corporate executives, including foreigners, Russian propagandists, political party leaders, family members, and proxies. The Group also proposes to consider introducing individual sanctions against all Russian athletes. The appendix to the document explains in detail who belongs to the appropriate category. The number of potential candidates for sanctions will be at least 12,000 individuals and 3,000 legal entities. The immediate priority is given to the 100 wealthiest people on Russia's Forbes list. According to the white paper, the sanctions coalition should focus on those who have been able to avoid sanctions in most or all jurisdictions. Examples are Vladimir Potanin, owner of Norilsk Nickel and other large assets, Andrey Bokarev, co-owner of Transmashholding and other significant assets; and Iskander Makhmudov, co-owner of Transoil, Transmashholding and other significant assets. The key sanctions mechanisms should be the freezing of assets, the ban on entry into the countries of the sanctions coalition, and the termination of powers in Western companies. It is crucial to involve as many countries as possible in a coalition of sanctions. If a person is subject to sanctions in one jurisdiction, all other jurisdictions should be the case. The role of the Ukrainian government in making any decisions on sanctions is emphasized. Also, according to the Group, any attempts by senior government officials, heads of corporations and board members, propagandists, and members of political parties to transfer property to their family members or proxies should be carefully monitored and prevented. Any assistance in transmitting or receiving such assets should be grounds for imposing sanctions. This roadmap and the previous papers of the Yermak-McFaul Group - Action Plan for Strengthening Sanctions and the Roadmap for Energy Sanctions have been provided to all key decision-makers. It is vital to continue to increase sanctions pressure on Russia."
"Address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy following the working trip to the Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions",2022-06-06T01:18:00Z,"Good health to you, dear Ukrainians! Today, it's the night address, so I will be brief. There was a lot of work. An endless day. I was in Zaporizhzhia, Zaporizhzhia region. Expressed support to our military and awarded the best. Heard the report. We were in positions. Had a meeting with the head of the regional state administration, the leadership of the local police, the Security Service, and some mayors of the temporarily occupied cities. Met with Mariupol residents, who managed to leave the city alive and with children. Here they were met by Khortytsia, humanely and warmly. Conditions - I saw - are temporary, but not bad. Understood their difficult questions. I think we will solve them. Each family has its own story. Most were without men. Someone's husband went to war, someone's is in captivity, someone’s, unfortunately, died. A tragedy. No home, no loved one. But we must live for the children. True heroes – they are among us. After that, together with the Head of the Office we headed east. We were in Lysychansk, we were in Soledar. I am proud of everyone whom I met, whom I shook hands with, with whom I communicated, whom I supported. We brought something to the military. I will not talk about it in detail. We also brought you something from them. It is important. We brought confidence. And strength. I wish them health. Low bow to their parents. I wish victory to all of us. Glory to Ukraine!"

Address by the President of Ukraine to the guests and participants of the Lithuanian National Film Award Sidabrinė gervė in Vilnius,2022-06-05T21:15:00Z,"Greetings from Kyiv! I will start this address with a short yet very important quote. ""If we live in some world, we hear some songs or radio, we watch some movies - this is all that creates us, creates our mentality."" These are the words of Mantas Kvedaravičius. He told them commenting on his film about Mariupol. A film with which he wanted to show how war affects the city. How war changes people. And these are seemingly simple words. But they are really about how it is determined what kind of life people have and what kind of people they are. Art itself, culture - in all its forms and in all their senses - shape people, educate them. Or vice versa - close them in the dark, in lies. And it can also be the responsibility of movies, books, songs and radio - everything we hear, see, read. That is why it is important to bear the truth. It is important to support art that is for life, not for those who want to destroy that life. Ukrainians will remember Mantas Kvedaravičius as a man who was just like that. He really deserves the Golden Swan. He valued life and always spoke out against what was life-threatening in his view - and that was a very attentive view. And I ask you to be just as attentive. So that you also support life. And remember Ukraine, Mariupol, and the fact that this war that took Mantas' life, Russia's war against Ukraine, must end. End as soon as possible. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine! Info. The Lithuanian National Film Award Sidabrinė gervė was held under the patronage of Prime Minister of the Republic of Lithuania Ingrida Šimonytė. The ceremony was broadcast live on Lithuanian national television. This year, the highest award of the ceremony - ""Golden Swan"" - was given for merits to Lithuanian documentary filmmaker Mantas Kvedaravičius, who died at the hands of the Russian occupiers in Mariupol."

According to him, 77 settlements of the Zaporizhzhia region were cut off from electricity due to hostilities. The enemy destroyed 2,701 infrastructure facilities, of which almost 700 have been rebuilt to date. Humanitarian hubs have been set up in the Zaporizhzhia region to shelter residents of the temporarily occupied territories and settlements where hostilities continue. ""Over the last 15 days the largest number of people have come from the Kherson region. They also come from Mariupol,"" said the RMA Head.

The Head of State inspected the medical offices where people can apply for medical care, as well as housing. The President talked to the IDPs and asked them about their living conditions.

""We have no doubt that we will liberate all the temporarily occupied cities. It will definitely happen,"" the Head of State said. IDPs from Mariupol spoke about the tragic events they had to endure due to the Russian invasion. They appealed to the President to help resolve the issue of recovering lost documents and issuing death certificates of relatives who died in the temporarily occupied territories.

If you have suggestions, we can also make some legislative changes,"" the President said. The meeting also focused on providing housing for internally displaced persons.

"Russian army can stop killing if one person in Moscow gives such an order, and the absence of such an order is a humiliation for the whole world - address by the President of Ukraine",2022-06-04T23:17:00Z,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! On this day, the 101st day of the full-scale war, the Skete of All Saints burned down in the Svyatohirsk Lavra in the Donetsk region. It caught fire as a result of Russian artillery shelling. Not the first shelling of the Lavra. Three Lavra monks were killed by the Russian shelling on Wednesday. Worship services are forced to be held in the basement. The roar of artillery and the ""arrivals"" of Russian shells are constant in the Lavra. And this is one of the three Lavras of Ukraine. This is the Lavra of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which is still considered in Moscow to be connected with the Russian Orthodox Church. Even this does not stop the Russian army. They are ready to burn everything: Orthodox churches just like anything else in Ukraine. During the full-scale war, 113 churches have already been destroyed or damaged by Russian shelling. Among them are the ancient ones - those that withstood World War II, but did not withstand the Russian occupation. There are also those that were built after 1991. Reconstruction of the Skete of All Saints of the Svyatohirsk Lavra began in 2001. June 10 would be another anniversary of the beginning of construction. I was interested in what Russian propagandists would say about the destruction of the skete. But, in fact, nothing interesting. They are very predictable. Ukrainians are accused of arson. Although the monks and laity in Svyatohirya saw perfectly that it was Russian artillery. I believe that this lie of the propagandists, this shelling, and the support of the Orthodox hierarchs in Russia for the aggression against Ukraine - all this should motivate the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to draw conclusions. More decisive conclusions and a clear condemnation of each of those who condone aggression. Ukrainian diplomats will do everything to make everyone in the world aware of this another crime of the occupiers. Russia is deliberately and systematically destroying Ukraine's cultural and historical heritage, as well as social infrastructure, housing, and everything necessary for normal life. A state that does this cannot be a member of UNESCO and cannot remain at the UN as if nothing had happened. The UN Charter does not provide any rights for terrorists, and UNESCO is not a place for barbarians. Russian troops again fired at the border areas of the Sumy region, Mykolaiv, cities and communities of the Zaporizhzhia region, Kharkiv region. The situation in Severodonetsk, where street fighting continues, remains extremely difficult. It is also difficult in Lysychansk, Marinka, Kurakhove, other cities and communities of Donbas. Constant air strikes, artillery and missile fire. As of this morning, the total number of various Russian missiles used against Ukraine is already 2,503. Our heroes hold their positions and do everything to inflict maximum losses on the enemy. I am grateful to each of our defenders who are approaching the day when Russia will have to leave Donbas alone. Today in our country the memory of children who died from Russian aggression was honored. Over the past day, the worst figure - the number of children killed - has not changed. 261 children. That's how many Ukrainian children lost their lives because of Russia. But this is the official number. The more we learn about those who were buried in the occupied territories, the greater, unfortunately, may be the number of names on this list. It's scary to read. Year of birth, place of residence, circumstances of death... All of them would be alive now if only one person in Moscow had not caused this catastrophe. This can no longer be fixed. Because this war is already going on. But the terrible consequences of this war can be stopped at any moment. The Russian army can stop burning churches. The Russian army can stop destroying cities. The Russian army can stop killing children. If the same person in Moscow just gives such an order. And the fact that there is still no such order is an obvious humiliation for the whole world. Eternal memory to all who died from the Russian invasion! Eternal glory to everyone who defends Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
Andriy Sybiha met with a delegation of the Ukrainian World Congress,2022-06-04T22:59:00Z,"Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Sybiha met with a delegation of the Ukrainian World Congress, which included UWC President Paul Grod, UWC First Vice President Stefan Romaniw, UWC Vice President Lenna Koszarny, Ukrainian Canadian Congress President Alexandra Chyczij, UWC Executive Director Sonya Soutus, Director of UWC Mission to Ukraine Serhiy Kasyanchuk, Executive Director of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress Ihor Michalchyshyn. Andriy Sybiha thanked the Ukrainian World Congress and non-governmental organizations of Ukrainians abroad for their comprehensive support for our state from the first minutes of the full-scale Russian invasion. He also noted the efforts of Ukrainians abroad in the context of providing humanitarian assistance to the Armed Forces and the affected population of Ukraine. The parties agreed that international actions, appeals and calls of foreign Ukrainians to the governments of the host countries are important. ""We must overcome the aggressor due to the joint coordinated actions of our international partners and the voice of Ukrainians abroad,"" said the Deputy Head of the President's Office. According to Andriy Sybiha, an extremely important task for Ukrainians abroad is to conduct effective information campaigns, in particular in those countries where there is a large Ukrainian community, as well as to counter Russian propaganda. ""Ukrainians are shedding blood to stop the onslaught of the enemy. Our priority is to restore the territorial integrity of Ukraine,"" Andriy Sybiha said. Ways of further support from the Ukrainians abroad aimed to effectively counter Russian aggression were discussed separately. In this regard, the Deputy Head of the Office of the President called on Ukrainian NGOs abroad to play an active role in ensuring important decisions made by governments of various states to support Ukraine, especially in the defense, financial and economic spheres. The parties coordinated further steps to consolidate joint efforts to increase defense, financial and humanitarian assistance, as well as to provide adequate care for internally displaced persons from Ukraine."
Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the presentation of the United24 platform in Washington,2022-06-04T10:28:00Z,"Greetings, Washington! Today is the hundredth day of Russia's full-scale war against us, against Ukraine. I want to tell you a story so that you understand what this war means to us. I want to tell you about Svitlana Klymenko, a nurse at a hospital in the town of Ivankiv near our capital. On February 24, the first day of Russian invasion, Svitlana lost her husband. He worked as a paramedic and went out on a call in the area where Russian troops tried to advance on Kyiv. Since then, the first day of the war, he has been regarded as missing.  The war also took away Svitlana's other closest person, her son. He perished in Mariupol. Svitlana spent over a month under occupation until her town Ivankiv was liberated from Russian occupiers. Despite the pain of loss, she didn't give up. She was doing her job. Just her job. Throughout the occupation, she worked at Ivankiv hospital and helped to save people. When I met her recently, she told me that it had been this work that had helped her make it through this. Saving others became her own life’s purpose. Svitlana continues working to this day. Like thousands of doctors and nurses, who have been rescuing people since February 24: children, women, and the elderly, because Russia does not spare anyone.  We must do everything we can to support them. So that they have something and somewhere to treat patients and where to treat them as well as armored ambulances, safe from Russian troops, who are shooting them. The Russian army is ruthless. They are not only trying to kill as many people as possible but also to destroy all the infrastructure required for living. Bridges and roads, houses and hospitals, schools and factories. Burned-out cities, universities, and maternity hospitals, destroyed by missiles.  Ruins are all that is left behind by the Russians. But people need to have somewhere to return. Right now. Today. That is the reason I initiated the special United24 platform. It is not just fundraising. It is also one of the ways to prove to Russia that evil will not win. Thousands of wounded need help. Thousands of objects need to be restored. Ladies and gentlemen, you can join in.  How – is entirely up to you. Rebuild the bridge to Irpin, whose photos have attracted worldwide attention, or buy medical equipment that will help Svitlana Klymenko and her colleagues save many, many lives. Your help will be transferred fast and used as effectively and transparently as possible. We guarantee that thanks to these donations your names will forever go down in the history of Ukraine, the history of defending freedom and democracy. Please join United24 today. Thank you, everyone! Glory to Ukraine!"
Don't help Russia justify itself and don't let the murderers call you their brothers and sisters - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the 90th annual meeting of the US Conference of Mayors,2022-06-04T09:07:00Z,"Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear Mayors of the United States of America! I am grateful for the opportunity to address you today. The United States has become a true leader in Ukraine's international support. This is defense, financial and political support. And it is based on a sincere connection between all nations who equally value freedom. On the fact that we, Ukrainians and Americans, equally understand the dangers of tyranny. The world has seen various tyrannies. At different times. Under different flags. And all of them are united by the fact that they despise the rights and freedoms of ordinary people. Tyrants do not recognize the rights and freedoms of local government. And it is usually the free people in the cities which still choose freedom that put an end to the history of tyrants. And to put an end to this, tyrants must not be allowed to enjoy ties to the free world. Any ties. You know that dozens of American cities maintain the so-called ""brotherhood"" with the cities of the Russian Federation. Chicago and Moscow. Jacksonville and Murmansk. San Diego - Vladivostok. Albany and Tula. What do these connections give you? Probably nothing. But they give Russia the opportunity to say that it is not isolated, even after beginning such a war. Each of you sees how the Russian army wages war and what it is doing to the peaceful cities of Ukraine. Its cruelty is no different from the tyrannies of earlier times. Mariupol was a port city, an industrial center with half a million people. Russia simply destroyed it. There is nothing there but ruins. Just as the city of Volnovakha and dozens of other cities that the Russian army burns daily. Burns with bombs, missiles, artillery. Just imagine - since February 24, Russia has used almost 2,500 different missiles against Ukraine. The vast majority of them were aimed at cities. At city infrastructure. And some of the most deadly Russian missiles are designed and manufactured in Yekaterinburg. Which, by the way, is still a sister city of San Jose. I'm sure many of you have seen and heard what Russian soldiers did in our city of Bucha. Mass killings, torture of people. The bodies of the killed locals laid on the streets while Russian soldiers remained in the city. One of those Russian brigades that did all this against our people in Bucha was a brigade from the Khabarovsk Krai of Russia. And the capital of this region - the city of Khabarovsk is still a sister city of Portland. What for? I leave you this question. Now, in order to restore normal life in Bucha and in the Bucha community, almost 2,000 buildings need to be rebuilt. You understand better than anyone else what this means for any city, when 2,000 houses are destroyed or damaged by missiles and hostilities. These are ordinary houses, ordinary schools, sports facilities, medical institutions. In total, as of February 24, 3,620 settlements in Ukraine faced Russian occupation - both large cities and small towns. In each of them there is destruction. Many of them are simply not suitable for civilized life. This is the reality that Russia has brought. When there is no connection in cities, there is no electricity, there is simply no water. When bombs and missiles can destroy any building - even a kindergarten or university. When the whole city can just be burned. But I believe that Ukraine will be able to defend freedom, and tyranny will definitely lose. People will again be able to live peacefully and safely in Ukrainian cities. And to make it happen faster, we have planned an ambitious project to rebuild Ukraine after this war. I invite you - your cities, your companies, your business and professionals - to take part in this project. You can also become the people who choose to defend freedom and thus put an end to the history of tyranny. Thanks to the leadership of the United States and the support of all our partners, Ukraine's bravery receives the necessary weapons to fight for freedom. But the economic advantage of a free world must also be demonstrated. That is why we are already inviting our partners to join the reconstruction of Ukraine. Take patronage over a city, region, or industry that has been destroyed by Russian strikes. And rebuild them with the latest technology. This may be the largest economic project of our time, which will strengthen Ukraine, each country and each company that will participate in the post-war reconstruction. You can join the implementation of this great project. This will definitely mean economic growth, innovation and new social opportunities for both our country and your cities. Ladies and Gentlemen! The beginning of the annual Conference of Mayors of the United States this year coincided with the 100th day of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. There are many issues on your agenda that concern the internal life of your country, your cities and communities. But remember - the full-scale war in Europe and the destabilization of world markets, which occurred because of Russia, directly affect the lives of every nation and all cities of the free world. Therefore, call for even more pressure on Russia. Don't help it justify itself. Don't maintain ties with it. And please do not allow those who have become murderers to call you their brothers and sisters. Help Ukraine. Help even more. Participate in the reconstruction of our cities, our communities that are liberated from the occupiers. Thank you very much for your attention. Glory to Ukraine!"
"""Peace"", ""victory"", ""Ukraine"" - three words we have been fighting for for a hundred days already after eight years - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-06-03T21:35:00Z,"Great people of great Ukraine! Exactly one hundred days ago we all woke up in a different reality. Exactly one hundred days ago, different us woke up. When Ukrainians are awakened not by the sun's rays, but by the explosions of missiles that hit our homes, then completely different Ukrainians wake up. In 2014, Russia came to us with one word, with a new word. And this is the word ""war"". On February 24, Russia added another word to it, making the phrase ""full-scale war."" And during a hundred days we found or received, saw or wanted to erase other words. There are few of them. They are different. But they reflect what we have experienced. Among these words are some new to us. And those that were forgotten by our parents, but that we had to recall. Well known to everyone on the planet. And those that all people have to remember with horror. Painful words. And those that really give us hope. All of them are important. It will be right to recall them all today. One hundred days - one hundred words. First of all, these are two words: ""our heroes"". First of all, people who have been defending our state since the night of February 24. And then - the Ukrainian words: ""palianytsia"", ""Armed Forces"", ""Stugna"", ""Cossack"", ""Zmiinyi"" and... Of course, ""Chornobaivka"" is a word that has sounded many times already and in which you can see everything about our resistance and about our enemies. And also - foreign words that have become native to Ukraine: ""Bayraktar"", ""Harpoon"", ""HIMARS"", ""Starlink"", ""Rzeszów"" and... Of course, ""Lend-Lease"" - another word, just one, but it reflects 100 days of struggle, 100 days of diplomacy, 100 days of support. And a word that reflects something important in our character. In the Ukrainian character. The “Javelins” that frightened the enemies because they did not expect the armor wouldn't save them. And then caused a smile, our smile, when Ukrainians also painted ""Saint Javelin"". Well, the word to which everyone in Ukraine raises a toast - ""Neptune"". Every day we had words that are much more than just words for everyone now. Hard words. “Hostomel”, “Borodyanka”, “Okhtyrka”, “Chernihiv”, “Kharkiv”, “Kherson”, “Izyum”, “Melitopol”, “Mariupol” and “Azovstal”. And with them - ""army"", ""artillery"", ""Marines"", ""border guards"", ""intelligence"", ""National Guards"", ""police"", ""territorial defense"", ""aviation"", ""our heroic pilots""... And also the word ""ghost"". The ghost of Kyiv. Who destroyed enemies and survived. We may not have heard all these words as many times in our lives as we have heard them in these hundred days. And every time we hear them, we know: they give us the time and opportunity to live as long as we are given. Given by God. Not by the enemy. ""God"" - this word, this appeal has been heard more than once. And always in a special way. There were also words that our enemy wanted to erase. ""Volnovakha"" and ""Saltivka"", ""Popasna"" and ""Severodonetsk"". These are words that we will definitely write again. But in our way. Just like ""Bucha"". Just like ""Mariupol"". And we will surely write them next to the word ""tribunal"". For other words - ""filtration"", ""deportation"", ""torture"", ""execution"", ""carpet bombing"", ""missile strike"" - to surely get an answer. Answer with just one word - ""justice"". Justice that will become a full stop after the temporary words for us ""occupation"", ""Mordor"", ""orcs"". Of course, they will leave our lexicon. We will definitely drive them out of our land. There were also words that gave hope and for which we fought particularly. ""Humanitarian corridors"", which have become a road of life for hundreds of thousands of people and made it possible to overcome another word, the terrible word ""blockade"". From the first day we have words the distance between which is as between darkness and light. We avoid one word. This word is “refugees”. And due to another word, we believe that millions of our people have a future. It will be at home, in Ukraine. This word is “displaced persons”. A lot has changed. When we hear the word ""Patron"", we remember the most famous sapper of Ukraine. And when we hear: “marathon”, we understand that it is not about sports at all. And of course, a lot of deadly words have been added to our lexicon. The words no Ukrainian ever wanted to see. And the words a normal person cannot be proud of. ""Iskander"", ""Kalibr"", ""Solntsepyok"", ""phosphorus bombs"" and more. For some reason we did not see their vaunted Armata tank. I think they were afraid of our new phrase: “tractor troops”. And one more phrase is worth mentioning: ""the second army of the world"". At first it looked threatening. Then it was dangerous. After Bucha - it caused disgust. And now - only a bitter smile. Because what's left of it? Of the army, which was called the second army in the world... War crimes, disgrace and hatred. And - numbers instead of words. When you see the number of killed every morning. The number of wounded. The number of shelling occasions. The number of missiles. When next to the word “children” there is a new number every morning. Today - 261. Already 261 children were killed by the Russian invasion. For what? There are no words that can answer this question. Words have appeared that are now very common. Which sound daily. But we must make sure that for our children they no longer mean what they mean to us today. So that they can perceive them only as history. First of all, it is the word ""ruins"". But also - siren, air alarm, curfew, checkpoint, barbed wire. And the word - mines. There will be many more words that everyone will know. Which will make sense for everyone. And which will give a chance to millions. These are the words - reconstruction, candidacy and membership, guarantees and security. And definitely the word ""return"". Of course, based on the word that was a dream, but will become a reality - ""liberation"". These are the words of our future! These are the words about what we will do to our red viburnum, to our glorious Ukraine. The words about where the enemy warship is heading and will always head. About what to do with the occupiers when someone says: ""Vova!"". And of course - our folklore already - ""Good evening! We are from Ukraine!"". From Ukraine, where the field is blooming, but her hair is getting gray. From Ukraine that stands and will stand. Ukraine, whose glory and freedom have not yet perished. Ukraine, to which we say - glory! Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the nation! And everyone knows the next phrase: ""Death to the enemies!"" Because there are three words we have been fighting for for a hundred days already after eight years: peace, victory, Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!"
Kyrylo Tymoshenko met with the leadership of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe,2022-06-03T20:27:00Z,"Pursuant to the task from Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak, Deputy Head of the Office of the President Kyrylo Tymoshenko met with President of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe Leendert Verbeek and Secretary General of the Congress Andreas Kiefer. Kyrylo Tymoshenko stressed that this visit is very important for the support of our country and people. He noted that Russia's military plans to capture Ukraine have failed, but the Kremlin continues hostilities, sending troops to our country. Kyrylo Tymoshenko stressed that Ukraine will continue to resist Russian aggression and does not intend to give up its territories and people. At the same time, as a result of the Russian invasion, many cities and infrastructure facilities in our country were destroyed, thousands of Ukrainians died, and millions were forced to flee their homes. ""I am grateful for the clear and decisive position of the members of Congress as regards Russian aggression. It is very important for us to continue the total pressure on the aggressor state,"" he said. The Deputy Head of the Office of the President also said that despite the war, several meetings of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities under the President of Ukraine were held, which allowed central and local authorities to stay in touch, resolve urgent issues and plan reconstruction measures. ""The initiative of the President of Ukraine is that for each region there is a state that will take patronage over its reconstruction. This applies to all regions, not just those affected by the war or currently occupied. Because the Head of State has a vision that this is a chance to change the country,"" Kyrylo Tymoshenko said. Therefore, according to him, catalogs were prepared for each region, which contain all the information about the destroyed and damaged infrastructure. ""Here we hope for your help, either in terms of targeted projects or in the framework of cooperation between cities and communities. Because it is important for us to start rebuilding, for example, schools before the beginning of the school year on September 1 or building housing for people who lost it,"" said the Deputy Head of the President's Office. Leendert Verbeek said that he had met with several leaders of Ukrainian cities affected by the war. He noted that the main goal of the Congress is to establish a dialogue between municipalities from different countries and exchange experiences. Andreas Kiefer stressed the importance of effective cooperation between central and regional authorities. According to him, the transfer of responsibility to the local level and mutual trust are important for the construction of a new and modern Ukraine. The parties also touched upon the organization of education for schoolchildren in Ukraine and for those who were forced to go abroad with their families to escape the war. In particular, they noted the need to adapt or combine school programs in Ukraine and those countries where children stay. Kyrylo Tymoshenko also noted that today the Ukrainian authorities are working to attract business to rebuild schools that were damaged as a result of the Russian invasion. There is also the issue of reorganizing the ways of transporting pupils to educational institutions from those settlements where schools were completely destroyed. The Secretary General of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe noted that he had already discussed with representatives of European organizations the possibility of contributing to the reconstruction of the affected regions of Ukraine."
Ihor Zhovkva: Portugal is our sincere partner on Ukraine's European integration path,2022-06-03T19:37:00Z,"During a working visit to the Portuguese Republic, Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Ihor Zhovkva met with the country's top political leadership. During a conversation with Prime Minister of Portugal António Costa, Ihor Zhovkva expressed gratitude on behalf of President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy for the strong support for our state in combating full-scale armed aggression. The interlocutors reaffirmed their willingness to enhance cooperation in the context of Ukraine's implementation of its intentions to become a full member of the European Union. ""I had a good opportunity to make sure that Portugal, which is geographically far from Ukraine, understands the concerns and needs of Ukrainians very well - we are sincerely grateful for the help provided. This means that it will definitely not be against a symbolic decision for Ukraine - the status of a candidate for EU membership,"" said the Deputy Head of the President's Office. During the meeting, special attention was paid to the prospects of involving Portugal in the post-war reconstruction of destroyed facilities in the regions of our country. ""It will be a good opportunity to build a part of Portugal in Ukraine - with its sun, warmth and always positive attitude to life,"" said Ihor Zhovkva. In a conversation with President of the Assembly of the Portuguese Republic Augusto Silva, the role of the parliamentary dimension of bilateral cooperation in ensuring support for Ukraine was highly praised. The parties highly noted the importance of the historic address of President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the Assembly of the Republic and the people of Portugal on April 21, 2022. ""I am glad that after the formation of the new Assembly of the Republic you have already begun to actively engage in a constructive dialogue with your Ukrainian counterparts and clearly condemned the Russian aggression in Ukraine,"" said the Deputy Head of the Office of the President. The whole spectrum of bilateral relations was discussed in detail with Minister of Foreign Affairs of Portugal João Cravinho. The interlocutors focused on increasing the sanctions pressure on the aggressor, accelerating the provision of heavy weapons to Ukraine, receiving financial assistance, as well as the prospects of Ukraine obtaining the status of candidate for EU membership. ""The support of the world community, in particular Portugal, is important for the consolidation of fundamental principles of international law, the task of which is to guarantee the security of sovereign countries,"" said Ihor Zhovkva. The Deputy Head of the Office of the President and the Foreign Minister of Portugal also discussed the prospects of deepening Ukraine's integration into the EU internal market, which will allow the Ukrainian economy to gradually recover. During a meeting with Minister of National Defenсe of the Portuguese Republic Helena Carreiras, the current security situation resulting from Russia's armed aggression was discussed in detail. Ihor Zhovkva thanked the Portuguese partners for their practical assistance and stressed that in order to liberate the territory temporarily occupied by the occupiers, the supply of weapons from our international partners should be much larger. ""Every day of delays in the supply of weapons costs too much for our society, so we are hopeful that Portugal will be able to approve appropriate decisions as soon as possible,"" said Ihor Zhovkva. The issue of available facilities for the treatment of wounded Ukrainian servicemen in Portugal was raised separately. The conversation between the Deputy Head of the President's Office and Secretary of State for European Affairs Tiago Antunes focused on Ukraine's practical steps towards European integration. Ihor Zhovkva expressed hope that after the positive conclusion of the European Commission in June, the relevant decision on granting our country the status of a candidate country for EU membership will be made by the leaders of the member states. ""Ukraine has not stopped working on the Copenhagen criteria for a single day, so we hope that the member states will recognize the importance of Ukraine's integration, which will only strengthen the European Union, in particular in the field of security and economy. In this context, the support for Ukraine's accession to the EU by the citizens of Portugal, which reaches 87%, is very important,"" said the Deputy Head of the Office of the President. Tiago Antunes said that the Portuguese side is ready to share the experience gained in the process of Portugal's accession to the EU. Pursuant to the agreements reached between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa in Kyiv, Ihor Zhovkva met with Portuguese Minister of Education João Costa and Parque Escolar Head Luis Silva Andrade. The Portuguese side was provided with information on the situation resulting from the destruction of more than 1,888 educational institutions, and was invited to join the rebuilding of the educational infrastructure. Ihor Zhovkva also thanked the Minister for providing study opportunities for Ukrainians who arrived in Portugal after February 24, and for preparing for holding the Ukrainian National Multidisciplinary Test in Lisbon. ""We appreciate that in difficult times, Ukrainian citizens have found a safe haven in Portugal and have the opportunity to attend secondary schools and study the Portuguese language,"" said Ihor Zhovkva. The Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine also met with President of the Parliamentary Group of the Socialist Party in the Assembly of the Republic Eurico Dias and former Chairman of the Portugal-Ukraine Friendship Group, Member of the Assembly of the Portuguese Republic Diogo Leão. The parties expressed confidence that the newly formed Portuguese Parliament would continue to develop close cooperation with the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, in particular within the parliamentary assemblies of numerous international organizations. ""We have high hopes that after the formation of a new friendship group with Ukraine in the Assembly of the Portuguese Republic, bilateral inter-parliamentary cooperation will be significantly intensified,"" said Ihor Zhovkva. During a meeting with Head of the Civil House of the President of the Portuguese Republic Fernando de Melo and Diplomatic Advisor to the President of the Portuguese Republic Maria Amélia Paiva, support for the Ukrainian people was expressed on behalf of President of the Portuguese Republic Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa.

"At the Shalimov National Institute of Surgery and Transplantology, the President talked to the doctors and Ukrainian soldiers undergoing treatment there",2022-06-03T17:19:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the Shalimov National Institute of Surgery and Transplantology and congratulated its employees on the 50th anniversary of the institution. ""Thank you for the great journey you have taken in these 50 years. At every step of this path, you save the lives of many people,"" the President said. The President thanked the doctors for their daily work and saved lives of patients. Volodymyr Zelenskyy inspected the premises of the Department of Endoscopic Surgery and Intensive Care and got himself acquainted with the methods of transplantation and treatment of polytraumas. He also spoke with Ukrainian servicemen who were wounded in battles with the Russian occupiers and are currently undergoing treatment at the institute. The Head of State thanked the soldiers for their feats and wished them a speedy recovery. The President presented state awards and awarded the honorary title of ""Honored Doctor of Ukraine"" to employees and physicians who provided assistance to civilians during Russia's armed aggression. ""I want to thank you. You are on the same frontline as our military. You conduct surgeries not only in surgical wards, but also in field hospitals. I wish you and your families good health. Thank you for taking care of all of us,"" the Head of State said."
"We have already started working on new sanctions packages against Russia, it will pay the full price for the destruction of the lives of neighbors - address by the President of Ukraine",2022-06-02T23:58:00Z,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! We have three important pieces of news. First, the European Union is gradually moving towards the implementation of the sixth sanctions package. Frankly, achieving this is very difficult. Because this sanctions package is primarily about oil. Finally, the world is giving up Russian oil. Moreover, other countries, which produce much better and lighter oil, are preparing to replace Russian supplies. Therefore, huge revenues are lost for the aggressor state in this sphere. Of course, Russia is constantly trying to counter this. It has long enjoyed the flow of petrodollars and does not want to be weaned off it. But it has to. It has to get used to the fact that a very painful reduction in income is an inevitable consequence of the war for its culprit, for the Russian state. The second piece of news is that the United States has confirmed at various levels that modern HIMARS are being sent to our country. These weapons will really help save the lives of our people and protect our land. I am grateful to President Biden, all our American friends, and the people of the United States for their support. We are looking forward to it. We also expect good news about the supply of weapons from other partners. For example, today we have a new package of defense aid from Sweden. I am very grateful to the leadership of this state. We are working to bring the supply of modern combat systems to a much higher level. Third, more and more embassies resume their full-fledged activities in Kyiv. As of today, there are already 50 of them. This is very important not only in practice - for the work of diplomats, but also on a symbolic level. Every new embassy that returns to our capital is a testament to the faith in our victory. Faith that Ukraine will be able to defend its statehood in this war unleashed on our land by the Russian Federation. A new and, I think, very important and beautiful tradition was launched today. From now on, the ceremony of presenting credentials by ambassadors of foreign countries who start their mission in Ukraine will take place not just in Kyiv, but on the territory of our St. Sophia Cathedral. And the first ambassadors that presented credentials today in such a new ceremony were the ambassadors of Moldova, India and the United States. Why there? Why in Sophia? Because it is the sacred, historical and statehood center of our people. Receiving the credentials of the ambassadors there, we demonstrate who the Ukrainians are, what we are and what is behind us. We hereby express our highest respect to the representatives of other nations. We open up to them. And at the same time we show that we expect from them the same respect, the same sincerity to the Ukrainian people, to our interests and to our history. Immediately after the ceremony, I spoke with the new ambassadors. Impressions are good. I hope for productive work. Today there were two important addresses: to the Luxembourg Parliament and to the participants of the Security Forum in Bratislava, which was attended by President of Slovakia Zuzana Čaputová, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and other friends and partners of our country. Of course, the key task is still to accumulate maximum support for Ukraine. First of all defensive, financial and, of course, political. Almost every address leads to increased assistance to our state. It is very important that now - in a few weeks - we are waiting for the answer of the European Union on the issue of candidate status for Ukraine. We are very much looking forward to it. And I am grateful to all those who have already spoken in support of our state, in support of the candidacy. In particular, in response to my requests in appeals to the parliaments of different countries, forums, student and expert communities, people in the squares of various European cities who rallied in support of Ukraine, in support of our people. We must understand that Russia has now mobilized all its forces to thwart Ukraine's European movement. And every tool - especially public debates and appeals - must be fully used. The situation in Donbas has not changed significantly in a day. We had some success in the battles in Severodonetsk. But it's too early to tell. The situation there is the hardest now. Just as in the cities and communities nearby - Lysychansk, Bakhmut and others. Many cities are facing a powerful Russian attack. The Russian army uses all its armed capabilities and does not count people at all. It is especially cynical that in the first line of the offensive the occupiers very often use those people who were recruited into their army in the previously occupied territory of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Russian soldiers often simply hide behind these so-called mobilized. The longer the war lasts, the more vile, shameful and cynical things Russia inscribes in its history forever. Absolutely senseless shelling of our border northern regions, in particular Chernihiv, continues from the Russian territory. Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, the Kharkiv region were shelled. The entire temporarily occupied territory of our state is now a zone of total catastrophe, for which Russia is fully responsible. We have already started working on new sanctions packages against Russia. Step by step, we will deprive the Russian state of all the elements of the modern economy. The occupiers will pay the full price for destroying the lives of neighbors. And no lobby in any country will help Russia. Today I signed a new decree on awarding our defenders, our heroes. 223 combatants were awarded state awards, 72 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to each of our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"
Olena Zelenska spoke with the First Lady of Latvia and the wife of the President of the European Council,2022-06-02T21:19:00Z,"First Lady of Ukraine Olena Zelenska held a conversation with First Lady of the Republic of Latvia Andra Levite and wife of the President of the European Council Amélie Derbaudrenghien. The interlocutors, in particular, discussed the National Program of Psychological Assistance to Ukrainian Victims of War and the program of prosthetics and rehabilitation of victims of hostilities. ""Before the war, I was involved in programs on a barrier-free environment for all Ukrainians. It is obvious that after the war, the demand for a barrier-free environment - both physical and psychological - will increase, because we have many injured people both physically and psychologically. So we are already working to ensure that they have a full life,"" said Olena Zelenska. The wife of the President of Ukraine also discussed with the First Lady of Latvia the issue of education for Ukrainian children abroad. In particular, Andra Levite will present bilingual alphabets to Ukrainian children temporarily staying in Latvia. ""This is a very nice contribution to the continuation of education for Ukrainian children, I am sure they will learn a new language. And it is very valuable for us that Latvia has supported our project ""Books without Borders"", when Ukrainian children's literature is published abroad under Ukrainian layouts. Our families often left with nothing at all, let alone books. And each of these books will be a bridge to home, to a quiet life for children,"" said Olena Zelenska."
"President received credentials from the Ambassadors of the United States, India and Moldova to Ukraine and started a new tradition of such ceremonies in St. Sophia's Cathedral",2022-06-02T20:46:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy received credentials from US Ambassador Bridget Brink, Ambassador of the Republic of Moldova Valeriu Chiveri and Ambassador of the Republic of India Harsh Kumar Jain who are starting their mission in our country. The ceremony of presenting credentials took place on the territory of the National Reserve ""Sophia of Kyiv"" with the participation of representatives of all foreign countries, whose embassies have already resumed work in Ukraine. The President congratulated the foreign ambassadors and noted that the easiest way they can help our state, which has been resisting the Russian invasion for 99 days, is to be here now. ""I thank all the ambassadors who stayed in Ukraine for as long as possible. Those who returned to Ukraine as soon as possible. I will be glad as much as possible to welcome all those who will soon return to our heart, to Kyiv,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Separately, the Head of State thanked those who did not leave the capital of Ukraine for all these 99 days. The President noted that Ukraine's heroic struggle against Russian aggression encourages many countries to change their attitude and perception of our state and see it as an equal partner and ally. ""The world applauds and admires our resilience and courage. Understands who we are, where we come from, what we want and, most importantly, where we are going. Sees us real. The people who defend their freedom and their land. Yes, this is us. Those who choose not to leave, not to run away, not to give up, not to kneel, but to fight. Struggle and fight. This is us. Those who defend their home, the eyes of our mothers, the smiles of our children. This is us. And that's exactly what our ancestors did. Many generations of Ukrainians who fought for an independent state. And every next generation knows about the feat of ancestors and is ready to defend their own land, no matter what occupier sets foot on it,"" the Head of State stressed. Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized that Ukraine today is a shield of Europe. ""But every shield needs swords. I hope the whole world understands this well. We need weapons to protect ourselves and you, your states. Good should be with fists, and even better - with HIMARS,"" he said. The President urged to support Ukraine and have faith in our state, because sooner or later the Ukrainian people always overcome any occupier. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also noted that the current ceremony of presenting credentials is held on the territory of Sophia of Kyiv, which was founded 1011 years ago and where fateful events took place and fateful decisions were made. According to him, from now on this place will become traditional for such events. ""From now on, it is in Sophia that the newly appointed ambassadors of foreign countries will present their credentials. This is a step by which Ukraine emphasizes its attitude to each ambassador and to relations with each state,"" he said. According to the President, this new tradition symbolizes three main things: trust, sincerity and responsibility. ""The first is trust. This is a sacred place for us. Those who stand here must be worthy representatives of their people. Those who stand here must be true friends of our people. The second thing is sincerity. Exactly sincerity. From our side. In this holy place for us, Ukraine promises to be a faithful friend and reliable partner before God. Those who stand here must never doubt the word of Ukraine. The third thing is responsibility. From your side. Those who stand here treat us the same way we treat them. Their intentions will always be bright, friendship - sincere, word - firm, and action - decisive,"" the Head of State emphasized. ""We are ready to be your ally not by protocol or etiquette. But by conscience and honor. We are ready to be true friends, strongly and forever. But we are ready only this way, and no other way,"" the President added. Receiving credentials from the Ambassador of Moldova, Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that at the beginning of the Russian aggression, the country sheltered a large number of Ukrainians seeking asylum. ""Our countries are united by the belief in justice. I do not want to say today that our countries are united by disaster, because we know what occupation is. We are united by happiness, because we know what freedom is,"" the President said. Addressing the Ambassador of India, Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that Ukraine and India are united by the belief in freedom and independence. The President quoted the words of the national hero of India Mahatma Gandhi that aptly describe Ukraine and Ukrainians: “Strength is in the absence of fear, not in the number of muscles in our body. First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win."" According to the President, relations with India are very important for Ukraine, and he appreciates contacts with the leadership of this country. For his part, Harsh Kumar Jain recalled that in 1996-1998 he worked as the Second Secretary for Economic Affairs of the Embassy of India in Kyiv. He noted that he was impressed by how much Kyiv has changed and Ukraine's progress during this time. Receiving credentials from the new US Ambassador, the President noted the strong leadership of the United States in supporting Ukraine. He expressed belief that the term of office of Ambassador Bridget Brink would only increase the strength of this partnership. ""Our countries are united by the belief in freedom. Belief in humanity. Belief that the world can and should be changed for the better,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. He thanked the United States and personally President Joseph Biden for the hard work and uniting the world to support our country in the war for common values. The Head of State thanked for the bicameral support in the US Congress and strong bipartisan support. He also thanked the American people for their solidarity with Ukraine. In addition, Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked Chargé d'Affaires Kristina Kvien for the work and great assistance to Ukraine in the struggle for its sovereignty and independence, and presented a state award to her. The President also presented state awards to Ambassador of Poland to Ukraine Bartosz Cichocki and Apostolic Nuncio, Archbishop Visvaldas Kulbokas who did not leave Kyiv during all 99 days of Russia's full-scale war against our country."
Granting Ukraine EU candidate status will demonstrate unity of European states - Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-06-02T18:25:00Z,"Ukraine expects to be granted the status of a candidate for membership in the European Union, as this decision will be a demonstration of the unity of European countries and will give our country additional motivation to defend democratic values. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during his online participation in the GLOBSEC International Security Forum. ""We all understand that the issue of membership in the European Union is decided not in a day or in a month. One of the motivations for our people today is the belief that Europe truly considers us equal, strong and powerful. Such motivation is the candidacy for membership in the European Union,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy, answering questions from the moderator. The Head of State stressed that the unity of the Ukrainian people is an important weapon in resisting the aggressor. ""People's unification depends on motivation. When the whole world looks at us, the whole of Europe, and we are supported - this is a great motivation. If you do not tire of supporting us with your morale, strength, and supporting us politically, the Ukrainian people will not tire of defending these values,"" the President said. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, despite the statements of the leaders of some European countries, the status of a candidate for EU membership is of special importance for Ukraine. ""For some of the leaders, this is a trifle. For the members of the European Union, this is a passed stage, and for us it is a motivation. Do not forget about such motivations,"" he said. The Head of State stressed that one of the results of Russian aggression was the unification of European states around Ukraine, and today it is very important to preserve this unity. ""Today, when the sanctions package is being discussed, when the decisions on the allocation of aid to Ukraine are being discussed, signals about a split, about certain steps of some states are starting to emerge. I believe that this unity cannot be lost, as it cost a lot,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said."
President of Ukraine at the GLOBSEC International Security Forum in Bratislava: We must respond to all the challenges and dangers that Russia has created against us ,2022-06-02T18:11:00Z,"Good afternoon! Thank you very much for this opportunity! Mrs. President Čaputová! Mrs. President von der Leyen! Mr. Prime Minister Heger! Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear friends! Thank you for the honor of speaking to you today. This year, for the first time in its history, the Bratislava Forum is organized in such a way that its panels will be held not only on land, but also on water. On a ship on the Danube. And it seems to me that this image is important. Because today discussing the challenges to European security and stability, the threats to all humanity in a comprehensive way is simply impossible without taking into account everything that is happening on water. One of the most important targets for the Russian army in Ukraine today is bridges across rivers. There are occasions when the Russian army strikes missiles three times at the same bridge to completely destroy it. It is impossible to overestimate the threat that Russian aggression has created for the water potential of our entire part of Europe - the center and east, the Black Sea basin. The nature of the fighting of the Russian army is frankly barbaric. They just destroy absolutely everything. Both residential buildings and industrial enterprises are being brutally bombed. In particular, environmentally hazardous chemical plants, metallurgical plants, etc. Fighting in Donbas has created a threat of groundwater pollution since 2014. If the flooding of coal mines in Donbas continues - among them, for example, the Yunkom mine, where an underground nuclear explosion took place in 1979 - poison and even radioactive contamination can get not only into the rivers of Ukraine, but also into the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Of course, speaking about the security challenges associated with our waters - the waters of rivers, the waters of the seas, it is impossible to avoid the blockade of Ukrainian ports by the Russian Federation. Because of this act of aggression by the Russian state, the world is on the brink of a food crisis. And it's not just a food problem. This is a shortage in the market. This is a catastrophic rise in prices for basic products. This is a threat of hunger for tens of millions of people in different countries. If this is not prevented, we will get the problem of political chaos in some countries in Africa and Asia. Consequently, the migrant crisis in Europe, when people from countries suffering from hunger will seek salvation. Also, the food crisis will inevitably lead to large-scale protests in European countries. Many governments will have to explain to protesters on the streets of various European cities why our continent has been taken hostage by one state - Russia - and one person - in Moscow - who ordered the naval blockade of Ukraine. And now I have mentioned only a few consequences and only in one area of many in which we have extreme threats. Extraordinary challenges. How should we respond to all this? Ladies and Gentlemen! Let's remember the Danube River again. It equally enriches different nations and different cities. Bratislava, Vienna, Budapest, Linz, Regensburg, Belgrade, Izmail and others. Slovakia, Austria, Germany, Romania, Serbia, Hungary, Moldova and Ukraine. For the Danube to remain clean and safe, for its economic potential, including transport, to work in full, the cooperation of all countries to which nature has given this river is needed. Therefore, unity is needed. Mutual understanding is needed. We need the ability to speak and negotiate for the common good. And these, by the way, are the key things for a peaceful and free life in Europe. This is what Slovakia can do. This is what Ukraine can do. This is what other partner states can do. And this is what Russia deliberately ignores. Does it try to hear someone? Understand? No. Does Russia recognize common interests? No. It sees only its own, and treats them quite specifically. Not as the interests of the entire Russian people, but as the selfish desires of a handful of state owners. And how does Russia perceive the very concept of unity? Only as an attempt to subdue others, to make them dependent on it, to destroy their identity. This is how they interpret unity - when the other and any diversity is simply destroyed. And this is exactly what they are doing on the territory of Ukraine. They are trying not just to kill people, but to erase the very fact that there is our state, that there is Ukraine. And that Ukraine seeks to be a full-fledged part of a united Europe. This is an openly anti-European policy of Russia. And such a policy obliges Europe to react, to react in a principled manner. First, to support Ukraine even more actively. With weapons, finances, politically. We are grateful for the help we already receive. To everyone who helps us. But arms supplies need to be increased. Because it is on the battlefield in Ukraine that it is decided whether freedom in Europe will be preserved for all nations without exception. And right now on the battlefield in Ukraine is a situation that could provide a turning point in the confrontation. Right now, these days, when Russia will lose the war against Ukraine, the freedom of Europeans will win for decades to come. Secondly, these are sanctions. The main purpose of the European Union's sanctions packages is not just to harm Russia, but to make Europe independent of Russia, to sever all critical ties between Russia and European countries that Moscow uses as a weapon, including the energy one. That is why I consider it unacceptable when so much time is spent discussing the sanctions package, in particular the sixth one. These are all our people, these are all our days. More than a month! Of course, it is good that the sixth sanctions package has finally been agreed. But it must start working immediately so that it is possible to move on to the preparation of the seventh sanctions package. Every remaining link between Europe and Russia is a rope that the Russian state will try to turn into a stranglehold. Thirdly, we must strengthen the unity of Europe, true unity. And the main step in this direction should be to grant Ukraine the status of a candidate for membership in the European Union, and subsequently full membership. There can be no temptation in Russia to assume that European countries will not support Ukraine in this matter. Because if Russia feels that Europe is weak and can leave Ukraine without the obviously necessary decision on candidacy, it will be one of the biggest destabilizing factors for the continent during Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. Ladies and Gentlemen! We must respond to all the challenges and dangers that the Russian Federation has created against us. Politics, economics, military sphere, food, environment, migration - there is no area of our lives in which there is no catastrophe, crisis or threat of catastrophe or crisis due to Russia's actions. The quality of our answers directly depends on only one thing - our unity. Any division in Europe is a chance, a chance for Russia. For it to continue its aggressive policy. I believe you are aware of this. So, I believe that we will be able to protect our continent and our people from everything that threatens us today. But we also have to think about tomorrow. About what will happen after the victory, together with you, we believe in our common victory over tyranny. That is why Ukraine is already working on a large-scale United 24 initiative. It is a system of tools that can, when fully built, protect not only our state, but also other nations from the threat of armed aggression, natural disasters and anything that can destroy lives. We aim to make sure that every state that needs help can receive it in 24 hours. Unfortunately, there is no such tool in the world today. Although it is obvious that there is a need for it. So, I urge you to familiarize yourself with how the first element of this future infrastructure works. Fundraising platform that allows you to accumulate funds from different sources for different needs, including defense, infrastructure, medical, social. Anyone without any bureaucracy can decide for themselves how to help a state in need. Gradually, we will add other tools to United 24. Diplomatic instruments, sanctions, technical tools - together with you. They will significantly upgrade the existing global security architecture. I am sure that the need to update it will also be one of the key topics of your discussions. So, pay attention to the Ukrainian proposals. And do not forget that the state, for which anything is a weapon or a way to aggression, is trying to destroy us all. Including your peaceful and beautiful Danube. Defend us! Defend yourself! Glory to Ukraine!"
Andriy Yermak and Valerii Zaluzhny discussed new package of military aid for Ukraine with Jacob Sullivan and Mark Milley,2022-06-02T15:58:00Z,"Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valerii Zaluzhny had a phone conversation with US President's National Security Advisor Jacob Sullivan and United States Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley.

President of Ukraine and Palantir CEO discussed cooperation in the defense and security sector,2022-06-02T15:44:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov had a meeting with Palantir CEO Alex Karp. The parties discussed issues of further cooperation in the field of defense and security, as well as digitization. ""Your visit to Ukraine is a positive signal that despite a full-scale war, Ukraine is open to business and ready for cooperation. We are delighted that Palantir is ready to invest in Ukraine and help us in the fight against Russia on the digital frontline,"" the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that Alex Karp is the first CEO of large Western corporations to personally visit Kyiv since the start of the full-scale war. For his part, the Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine spoke about measures to combat cyber threats from Russia. ""We are actively working not only on the digital blockade of the Russian Federation, but also to attract top international companies to Ukraine. This is one of our priorities today. Modern warfare has changed the rules, and technology plays a big role in it. Cooperation with Palantir is of great importance for us, as it will help us strengthen our army and defeat the enemy as soon as possible,"" said Mykhailo Fedorov. During the meeting, Alex Karp said that the company is ready to open an office in Ukraine and prepare joint developments with Ukrainian specialists. He also expressed support for Ukraine and admiration for the Ukrainian people. Palantir is a company that develops software for data analysis. The main customers are investment banks, special services and hedge funds. In addition to Alex Karp, its founders include Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal and one of Facebook's first investors."
Sanctions pressure on Russia should be continued and a full embargo on Russian energy should be imposed to force the Kremlin to end the war against Ukraine - Yermak-McFaul International Expert Group,2022-06-02T15:05:00Z,"A group of independent Ukrainian and international experts analyzing the impact of sanctions imposed on Russia, co-chaired by Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak and former US National Security Advisor Michael McFaul, urges the European Union to speed up a full embargo on Russian energy to end the war in Ukraine as soon as possible. In its statement, the group emphasizes that over the past three months, the democratic world has repeatedly demonstrated unity and the capacity to respond to the unjust war unleashed by Russia against Ukraine. On May 31, the European Union (EU) announced the approval of the Sixth Package of Sanctions against Russia. It includes a ban on imports of Russian oil by sea, the exclusion of Sberbank from the SWIFT international system, the banning of three more Russian media broadcasters, and the extension of individual sanctions.  “Such sanctions will deprive Russia of the opportunity to export 90% of its oil to the EU by the end of 2022. The International Working Group on Russian Sanctions welcomes such a statement by the EU, given that the embargo on Russian energy serves as one of the most effective economic levers of pressure to stop Russia's aggression,” the statement reads.  The experts emphasize that the pressure on Russia's economy is an essential tool to prevent Russian President Vladimir Putin's regime from funding hostilities in Ukraine and to force it to end them. In addition, experts believe that Russia's current revenues from energy exports should be frozen in European bank accounts. “At the same time, we believe that the delay in implementing the Sixth Package has reduced the effectiveness of previous measures, including restrictions on the financial system. Russia has continued to adapt to sanctions,” the statement reads. Thus, over the time that has passed since the decision to reduce dependence on imported energy, Russia has gained additional opportunities for adaptation and tens of billions of oil and gas revenues. “Further delays in implementation of a full embargo on Russian energy will thus reduce the effectiveness of sanctions. A complete oil and gas embargo against Russia is necessary.  The EU must speed up its introduction and adopt tough decisions that are commensurate with the level of Russia’s threat as soon as possible,” the statement reads. The group is convinced: the sooner such decisions are made, the more painless the reorientation of the economy and preparation for winter will be.  “All the consequences of the embargo will be manageable, as detailed in our Energy Sanctions Roadmap. This document also proposes revenue reducing measures during the transition to a full embargo,” the experts noted. A combination of sanctions – a complete oil and gas embargo and the exclusion of all Russian financial institutions, including Gazprombank, from the global system – can speed up the likelihood of peace on the European continent. The democratic world must recognize the Kremlin regime as a terrorist at the legislative level, limiting business ties with Russia. “We call for solidarity and determination, not just loud rhetoric. We must not stop at the sanctions pressure, this is the only way to force the Kremlin to end the war against Ukraine,” the statement reads."
Speech by the President of Ukraine in the Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg,2022-06-02T13:30:00Z,"Dear Mr. President! Dear Mr. Prime Minister! Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, members of the government, everyone present! Dear people of Luxembourg! Thank you for the opportunity to contact you. Your state has a wise and extremely relevant motto: ""We want to stay what we are."" And this is now perceived in a special way. You cannot pass by these words. Because what are we fighting for? For what we are. And to stay what we are. Free, independent, open and united with all Europeans. We have been fighting for this right, this aspiration for a very long time. Much longer than Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. By the way, tomorrow is the hundredth day of this war. And when this characteristic is used - full-scale - it is usually just a rhetorical separation of the ongoing war from the war that Russia started in 2014. Then, 8 years ago, the Russian army invaded our land and occupied part of it for the first time. The Crimean peninsula and a third of Donbas, including the largest cities, Donetsk and Luhansk. The fighting in Donbas lasted for 8 years. There were very hot and bloody phases of confrontation. There were also short periods of ceasefire, which cost many great diplomatic efforts. Ukraine has lost more than 14,000 people killed - from 2014 to February 24 this year. More than one and a half million people have become internally displaced persons. As a result of the then campaign of invasion, the Russian army controlled more than 43,000 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory. This area is comparable, for example, to the area of the Netherlands. And for most European countries, such a scale of war would be enormous already. But on February 24, Russia showed that it was not a scale at all for it. It showed that its cruelty is much greater. Russian troops entered 3,620 settlements in Ukraine. 1,017 of them have already been liberated. Another 2,603 are to be released. As of today, about 20 percent of our territory is under the control of the occupiers. Almost 125 thousand square kilometers. This is much larger than the area of all the Benelux Countries combined. About 300 thousand square kilometers are bestrewn with mines and unexploded ordnance. Almost 12 million Ukrainians have become internally displaced persons. More than 5 million, mostly women and children, have gone abroad. Fighting continues on the huge territory from the city of Kharkiv in the east of our country to the city of Mykolaiv in the south. A straight line between them is 454 kilometers long. But if you look at the entire frontline, and it is, of course, not straight, this line is more than a thousand kilometers. Just imagine! Constant fighting, which stretched along the frontline for more than a thousand kilometers. Every day Ukraine suffers from Russian missile strikes. Just yesterday, Russia used 15 different cruise missiles. And since February 24, 2,478 missiles have been used. Most of them were aimed at civil infrastructure. We have to defend ourselves against virtually the entire Russian army. All combat-ready Russian military units are involved in this aggression. The occupiers' death toll is already more than 30,000 soldiers. That's greater than the death toll of the Soviet Union in 10 years of war in Afghanistan. Greater than Russia’s death toll in two Chechen wars. But this does not stop Russia. This state is still ready to lose and kill, kill people. Because only one person in Russia doesn’t want to let us stay what we are. The Russian army has already destroyed almost the entire Donbas. This once one of the most powerful industrial centers in Europe is simply devastated. The occupiers are destroying it city after city. Just look at the city of Mariupol. There were half a million people, ordinary peaceful life in an important industrial city. Now there are burnt out ruins. And we still don't even know exactly how many of our people were killed by the occupiers. At least tens of thousands - tens of thousands in a little less than 100 days. This is what it means, in fact, to characterize this war as full-scale. And that is why we are so loud urging the world to support us. First of all, calling for defense support. Ladies and Gentlemen! Ukraine has shown extraordinary bravery. We did not surrender to Russia. We have stopped and are gradually pushing the army of invaders, which was recently considered the second strongest in the world, out of our territory. Nobody expected Ukrainians to have courage of this magnitude. But this magnitude is there. And this quality of our character, our willingness to fight for freedom and for our values - and these are the common values of all free Europeans - is now based on the support we have received from our partners. I am very grateful to you, the authorities and the people of Luxembourg, for the historic decision to provide Ukraine with weapons. Unlike other states, Luxembourg does not have large military depots or significant defense industry. But you have shown solidarity on the scale of a great nation and provided defense assistance in a timely manner - how important it is - and without excessive bureaucracy, as befits people with a great soul. You have proven that your potential is stronger than that of some who have remained weak even despite a much larger geographical scale. I am also grateful to you for participating in the sanctions pressure on Russia. Only together can all democracies ensure that Russia is satisfied with the scale of its own territory and never encroaches on the lives of other countries. We understand that no one will be able to stay away and avoid being affected when a catastrophe of such enormity occurs in the world because of the Russian state. It is reminiscent of World War II, when Nazi aggression threatened the lives of entire nations. Therefore, we must significantly increase the pressure on Russia to stop this catastrophe and prevent such aggressions in the future. We need more weapons for Ukraine - modern weapons that will ensure the superiority of our state over Russia in this war not only through courage, intelligence, but also technologically. And I ask you to advocate this need before other European states. More sanctions on Russia are needed for the war. As soon as the sixth sanction package is imposed, we should all prepare the seventh. All Russian officials working for the war and all Russian judges working for repression must be subject to the sanctions. The assets of these and other persons, both individuals and legal entities, subject to sanctions, as well as the assets of the Russian state in foreign jurisdictions must be frozen. All of them. And we need to find a legal way to confiscate them in order to compensate for the damage that Russia has done to the victims of the war. That will be fair. And - instructive for the aggressor. We must show that European unity outweighs any doubt about Europe's ability to defend its values. Ukraine has de facto become part of the European Union. We are already cooperating both bilaterally and at the EU level on a scale commensurate with full membership. What can prove this better than the fact that we protect each other? And I believe that your country - as one of the founders of a united Europe - will support first the candidacy for Ukraine, and later the membership in the European Union. I am sure that your specialists and companies will join the project of reconstruction of Ukraine after the war. And this will be the largest economic project in Europe of our generation. Luxembourg's investment and technological potential and ability to organize a comfortable city life are well known. And I believe that we will see how your potential will work in Ukraine for the benefit of both our nations. Mr. Prime Minister! I invite you to visit our capital, Kyiv, so that we can discuss our further cooperation in detail. We will be glad to hear your speech in our parliament - in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. Ladies and Gentlemen! I want to recall these words again: ""We want to stay what we are."" Right now, Russia's war against Ukraine is crucial for the whole of Europe as well. This is a war for values. When we win this war, all Europeans will be able to continue to enjoy their freedom. But if the person who wants to destroy any freedom in Ukraine and Europe prevails, there will be a dark time for everyone on the continent. One that has already been in the history of Europe, which has brought the continent a lot of suffering and victims. And an echo of which can still be heard sometimes today, unfortunately, in the voices of those who are trying to undermine European unity. Tyranny must lose. So that Europe can stay what it is. What it is now. Free, open, united and able to be strong in diversity. And I am grateful to you for the fact that the Grand Duchy is truly defending freedom with us. Thank you all! Thank you Luxembourg! Glory to Ukraine!"
Address by the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak to the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Gulf Cooperation Council,2022-06-02T11:40:00Z,"Your Highness, Your Excellencies. Thank you for joining us today for this conversation. For more than 3 months, our country has withstood brutal and unprovoked Russian aggression. The world sees the Russian occupiers massacring our people, torturing and raping men, women and even children. They are destroying our cities and infrastructure. They are forcibly deporting hundreds of thousands of our people to Russia, including children. They just steal. The Russian army is behaving like a gang of looters. But the Ukrainian people repel the aggressor decently. We are determined to defeat and drive the occupiers out of our land. And we will do it. Gradually, arduously, but relentlessly. Law and justice are on our side. This is clearly evidenced by the resolution of the UN General Assembly adopted on March 2 this year, which calls on Russia to immediately stop the illegal use of force against Ukraine and withdraw all its troops. We are extremely grateful to the Gulf Cooperation Council countries for supporting this resolution. Russia has not simply violated all major international norms. Representatives of the Russian leadership have repeatedly denied Ukraine's right to exist independently. Therefore, this is not just another imperialist war. This is an attempt to destroy the Ukrainian identity, to erase Ukrainians from the book of history. Russia is fully responsible for violating the Genocide Convention, which it has pledged to abide by. The Russians are trying to destroy the Ukrainians and conquer our country. But this is only one of their goals. Russia is building an empire. Syria and Libya have already felt its friendship. The Russian war in Ukraine already affects the whole world. The food crisis caused by the blockade of Ukrainian ports will directly affect the population of Arab countries with dangerous unpredictable consequences. Ukraine and your countries have long been reliable partners and friends. Nothing will change that. Our ties will be strengthened as the crisis not only brings challenges but also opens up new opportunities. We greatly appreciate the help that your countries already provide. This is really important for us. We ask you to take further action to help us punish the aggressor and end this war. Evil must be stopped in time until it burns the whole world out. Minister Kuleba will tell the details. And I will outline some key points that need maximum attention. 1. First. The application of international economic sanctions is absolutely necessary. Russia, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, is blocking all legally binding decisions, despite the unanimous international condemnation of its illegal invasion. Economic pressure must deprive Russia of the financial, technical and technological resources to wage this war, as well as subsequent aggressive wars. I personally coordinate the work of the Yermak-McFaul international expert group aimed at strengthening sanctions against Russia. The goals of our Sanctions Action Plan include a total ban on Russian energy exports, the expansion of sanctions against the financial sectors of Russia and Belarus, the strengthening of transport and insurance sanctions, the expansion and strengthening of trade embargoes and personal sanctions. We call on the Gulf Cooperation Council to join the sanctions regime against the Russian Federation and in no way assist Russia and certain members of its authorities in avoiding existing restrictions. 2. Second. We hope that the Gulf states will play an active role in resolving the current global food and energy crisis, which Russia is using as instruments of war and pressure on the international community. It is time for decisive action and confident steps. Yesterday, the EU agreed on a sixth sanctions ""oil"" package against Russia. This is an opportunity for the Gulf countries, for the benefit of themselves, to help the West overcome its energy dependence on Russia. Ukraine is also interested in long-term and effective solutions in this area. I would like to take this opportunity to offer you a number of initiatives aimed at comprehensively deepening our mutual understanding and developing cooperation. First of all, I would like to propose the establishment of a special Advisory Council under the auspices of the Head of the Office of the President and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine for your region. I would be happy to see foreign ministers as well as people with powers similar to mine there. This council could be a useful platform for discussing pressing issues such as grain supplies and energy security. But not only. I think it would be appropriate to use this forum to address issues that affect the interests of the GCC and their allies. To this end, within a week or two, we could agree on a special representative to discuss organizational issues, including the Council's mandate, and set up a secretariat. Together, we can find ways to prevent the humanitarian catastrophe that can be caused by the food crisis. It bears reminding that a number of Islamic countries in Africa and South Asia are already at risk. I would like to pay special attention to the issue of information exchange. Ukraine wants to become more open and understandable to the Arab world. Therefore, we are ready to facilitate the opening of offices of Arab state television companies in our country. We will provide them with an adequate level of security. In our opinion, Europe is too self-centered, so Ukraine offers the Arab world to work together to expand its horizons. In particular, through the tools of soft power provided by television. The next offer is to some extent a continuation of the previous one. Crisis and war are always an opportunity to show humanism. You know, Ukraine is a multi-religious and religiously tolerant country. We consider that the Red Crescent should be represented in it at the same level as the Red Cross, we believe it is fair. Another proposal concerns finance. Ukraine is preparing to launch the National Sovereign Fund. The agricultural industry and land banks should become its leading assets. We offer your sovereign national investment funds cooperation in this and other areas. 3. I will move on to the third point. Together with former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, I am chairing an international advisory group that will make proposals on security guarantees for Ukraine. These guarantees will include expanding Ukraine's defense potential with modern weapons and military equipment, exchanging intelligence and information, financial assistance to Ukraine, and preventive sanctions in the event of a real threat of new aggression. It is also about Ukraine's political and diplomatic support, including Ukraine's deep involvement in multilateral formats that will improve its integration with the international community. We invite leading figures in security, politics and diplomacy from your countries to join this group. The criminal aggression of a permanent member of the UN Security Council has shown that the world needs a radical update of the international security system. President Zelenskyy's idea is to start building the foundations for a new world order based on the system of security guarantees for Ukraine. I am convinced that the Arab world should play a leading role in this process. 4. Fourth. Thanks to the unwavering determination of the Ukrainian nation, military prowess and assistance from friendly countries, Ukraine will definitely win. It will become a regional leader in Eastern Europe. Russia has one prospect - a gradual decline. Ukraine, on the contrary, will develop rapidly. Please think about your own economic interests. After our victory, Ukraine will become the world's largest construction site. And we invite you to join this process. I am confident that we will not just continue our joint projects, but expand our cooperation as much as possible. Including in the field of agriculture, transport, tourism, defense, IT. Today, we call on the Gulf states to provide us with financial assistance to strengthen our resilience. And immediately after the war - we offer you to take part in the reconstruction of our country. We invite you to join large-scale infrastructure, transport and humanitarian projects that will affect the future of the entire continent. We know that the leadership of your countries demonstrates wisdom and focus on strategic perspectives. So be with Ukraine! Join our common future! Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!"
In cooperation with UNICEF a plan to rebuild destroyed schools by September 1 was developed - Kyrylo Tymoshenko,2022-06-02T10:52:00Z,"On June 1, Deputy Head of the Office of the President Kyrylo Tymoshenko together with UNICEF Ukraine Representative Murat Sahin visited the Center for Support of Children and Families ""Spilno"" in Bucha. It was opened at the initiative of UNICEF in Ukraine. ""We met with UNICEF officials in Ukraine and developed a preliminary plan on the assistance from UNICEF in the reconstruction and restoration of schools by September 1. President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy has set a task to restore as many schools as possible by September 1,"" Kyrylo Tymoshenko said. According to him, about 20% of schools and kindergartens across the country were destroyed. ""Institutions need to be either completely reconstructed or demolished and built from scratch. There are schools where only windows or roofs are damaged, it can be restored in a month and a half. And there are more complex works, such as the restoration of walls and buildings. We will try to rebuild as many kindergartens and schools as possible by September 1,"" said the Deputy Head of the President's Office."
"Every person matters, this is the main thing that distinguishes us from the occupiers - address by the President of Ukraine",2022-06-02T00:23:00Z," Ukrainians! Defenders! Every year on June 1 we celebrate Children's Day. A special day when adults pay special attention to the rights of children, safety and development of our kids. But since February 24, everything has changed in our country. And literally every day now is a day of protection for us. Protection of all our people, children, our future. Protection of a free country where every child can, when he or she grows up, live the life he or she wants. Without coercion and oppression. Everyone sees what Russia brings to Ukraine and what it wants to bring to other European countries. Total contempt for individuals, for entire nations. The Russian state despises even its own citizens so much that they do not understand the value of human life at all. Russian soldiers kill and die themselves as if they were not people, but just dust. Dust under the feet of the owners of Russia. The principles of our life are completely different. And although life has changed with the onset of wartime, our principles remain the same. Every person matters. This is the main thing that distinguishes us from the occupiers. During the 98 days of the Russian invasion, 689 children were injured as a result of the occupiers' attacks. And these are only those we know about. We do not yet have all the information from the territory that is currently occupied. But from what is known today - 446 children were injured, 243 children died. 139 went missing. It is said that human consciousness does not perceive large numbers. The larger the number, the harder it is for a person to realize what is behind it. Destroyed families. Little personalities who did not even have time to see what life is like. Like little Denys from the Zhytomyr region, from the village of Malynivka, who died with his whole family when a Russian plane dropped bombs on the village. Denys was less than two years old. Like Stepan from the village of Novi Petrivtsi, Kyiv region. He was less than three years old when a Russian shell hit the yard. The kid was fatally wounded. Like Anya from Bucha, Kyiv region, she was 14 years old. She was killed when the Russian military fired at a minibus on the road. People were just trying to escape. Anya was in that car with her mother and grandmother. They all died. Polina, she was not even two years old. A Russian tank fired at a house in Borodyanka. An ordinary house. Direct hit. Polina died. Arina, Mykolaiv region. On March 5, she received shrapnel wounds as a result of artillery shelling, the occupiers hit the usual residential sector. She died at the hospital. Now, in June, Arina could be 4 years old. Svyatoslav from Odesa, he was 15 years old. He was killed by a Russian missile strike at a dormitory. It happened on May 2. His body was retrieved from the rubble of the house. Alisa from Okhtyrka, Sumy region. 7-year-old kid. She died on the second day of a full-scale war as a result of Russian artillery shelling. The occupiers simply fired at the houses. Mykyta from the city of Izyum, Kharkiv region. He was 3 years old. On the night of March 3, he was killed by a Russian air strike at the city. A total of nine people died that night. Two sisters - Varvara and Polina from Mariupol. Varvara was 14 years old and Polina was 11. They died as a result of the Russian shelling of an apartment building. I have named only ten children from the list of two hundred and forty-three. And it's not just numbers. Each line is a separate world that was destroyed by the Russian army. In this list there are those about whom nothing is known at all, even the name... 243 children! Eternal memory to everyone whose life was taken away by the Russian war against us, against Ukrainians, against Ukraine. About 12 million of our citizens have been forced to flee their homes due to the war. More than 5 million went abroad. And the vast majority of them are women with children. We will do everything so that they can return home to Ukraine. Russia is also pursuing a consistent criminal policy of deporting our people. Forcibly deports both adults and children. This is one of Russia's most heinous war crimes. In total, more than 200,000 Ukrainian children have been deported so far. These are orphans from orphanages. Children with parents. Children separated from their families. The Russian state disperses these people on its territory, settles our citizens, in particular, in remote regions. The purpose of this criminal policy is not just to steal people, but to make deportees forget about Ukraine and not be able to return. But we must find a solution to this challenge as well. And ensure that all those who killed, tortured or deported Ukrainians are held accountable. The inevitability of punishment is a principle that Ukraine will definitely teach Russia. But first of all, we must teach it on the battlefield that Ukraine will not be conquered, that our people will not surrender, and our children will not become the property of the occupiers. Today I signed two new decrees on awarding our heroes. 380 combatants were awarded. In total, since the beginning of the full-scale war, 17 thousand 86 defenders of Ukraine have received orders and other awards. Thanks to all those who defend our state, our people, our children, we can be sure that Ukraine has everything, and has a future. Glory to Ukraine!"
President took part in a meeting of the Council on Issues Related to the Life and Safety of Children in Wartime and talked with children in Ukraine and abroad,2022-06-01T17:15:00Z,"On the International Children's Day, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy took part in a meeting of the Council on Issues Related to the Life and Safety of Children in Wartime and Postwar chaired by Andriy Yermak, Head of the Office of the President. During the event, the President spoke in a video conference format with Ukrainian children temporarily staying in the Republic of Poland and with students of Drohobych Lyceum, among whom were residents of different regions of Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy congratulated them on the Children's Day and stressed that the day of the return of all children to their homeland will be a great holiday for him personally. ""We will do everything we can to bring you all back. Bring all of you back as children, not adults. That is, bring you back soon. It is very important for us that you build our country and our future, because you are our beautiful future, for which we are all fighting today. Therefore, we will do everything to return you as soon as possible, but I want us to return you to a safe Ukraine,"" he said. The President also noted that he is grateful to Poland and its people for providing good conditions for Ukrainian children. During the conversation with the students of Drohobych Lyceum, Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that he was glad to have the opportunity to talk to smart children who ask serious questions. In particular, the President was asked about guaranteeing the security of Ukraine after the war, the participation of young people in the reconstruction of our country, the prospects for the resumption of a full-fledged educational process. The main topic of the Council's meeting was the development of a clear mechanism for recording the crimes of forced deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia and the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, identification of deported children in order to return them. Volodymyr Zelenskyy was informed that as of today, 234,000 young Ukrainians have crossed the border with Russia, 4,795 children among them are identified. Daria Herasymchuk, Adviser - President's Commissioner for Children's Rights and Children's Rehabilitation, said that the signing by the Russian President of a decree on a simplified regime of obtaining Russian citizenship by orphans and children deprived of parental care was an attempt to legalize the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children. The need to maximize the use of international channels to monitor the status of children deported to Russia and to document the crimes committed against them was emphasized. International organizations should also be involved in the process of returning Ukrainian children home. To make the search for children more effective, according to Daria Herasymchuk, it is necessary to combine data from the registers that exist in Ukraine and create a single register of children gone missing under special circumstances, including forcibly deported, displaced and missing children during the military Russian invasion of Ukraine. ""We have more than 150 registers. According to our analysis, the ten main registers give us a clear picture of where the children are. Therefore, we set ourselves the task of creating a joint register, which will find all children by personal identification. And we will be able to form a list of names of children whose whereabouts we do not know,"" she explained. Based on these data, it will also be possible to obtain evidence of the genocide of the Ukrainian people, one of the signs of which is the forcible transfer of children from one national group to another. Daria Herasymchuk added that such a register could be created on the basis of the law enforcement body of Ukraine. Andriy Yermak said that a meeting with representatives of the G20 countries would be held in the President's Office in the near future to discuss, among other things, the issue of deportation of Ukrainian children. The Council is also working on the concept of the information and communication portal ""Children of War"", which will publish daily information on how many children died and were injured as a result of hostilities in Ukraine. In addition, there will be information about the search for children from the National Police of Ukraine, the data of children who were deported to Russia. On this portal you can apply for a search for a child who is lost or deported, as well as submit information about other crimes against children."
Volodymyr Zelenskyy took part in the opening of the Ukrainian-Polish intergovernmental consultations,2022-06-01T16:51:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy took part in the opening of the Ukrainian-Polish intergovernmental consultations. The President noted that it is a great honor for the people of Ukraine and for him personally to meet with the Polish delegation. ""Ukraine has great respect for the people of Poland and the leadership of your country, we are grateful to you,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. According to the President, the meeting of the two governments in this format is taking place for the first time and is historic for our states. ""I want to note the priority of relations between Ukraine and Poland. I believe that due to Russia's war against Ukraine our relations have moved from warm and neighborly to a new stage - strong and historical relations,"" he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted the exceptional support for our state by the Republic of Poland, which has manifested itself in many areas. In particular, this is unprecedented defense assistance, as well as support for Ukrainian citizens who were forced to leave for Poland to escape the war waged by Russia. ""I want to thank the people of Poland for this closeness, warmth and humanity in relation to our citizens,"" said the President, emphasizing that the state will do everything to ensure that Ukrainians return home after the war. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also expressed hope that President of Poland Andrzej Duda and the entire Polish government will join the reconstruction of certain territories of Ukraine that were destroyed as a result of Russian aggression. The President thanked Prime Minister of Poland Mateusz Morawiecki for being the true advocate of Ukraine's future membership in the European Union. ""I am very glad that we have a large geopolitical army that has come to support Ukraine and that sees Ukraine on an equal footing among equal partners,"" the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed hope that important bilateral documents on cooperation between Ukraine and Poland would be agreed during today's consultations. ""We strongly believe in our relations and our great future,"" he said. As a sign of gratitude on behalf of the Ukrainian people, the President of Ukraine presented state awards to Mateusz Morawiecki and Polish Deputy Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński for helping Ukraine defend its independence and territorial integrity during the Russian invasion. After that, a joint meeting of the governments of the two countries was held with the participation of Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal and the Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland. The agenda included issues of legal and social guarantees for Polish citizens on the territory of Ukraine, the development of the western Ukrainian state border and cooperation in exercising control during the crossing of the Ukrainian-Polish border, etc. In addition, a number of bilateral documents will be signed."
"Andriy Yermak: Weapons, sanctions and consolidated position of democratic world will help stop Russian aggression",2022-06-01T10:02:00Z,"Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak is convinced that if all the necessary weapons are obtained and effective sanctions are imposed, Ukraine will win this war, and only such steps can force Russia to sit down at the negotiating table and enter into dialogue. He said this while participating in a video conference format in a meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence of the Irish Parliament. ""I am convinced that if we get all the necessary weapons and the effective sanctions regime is strengthened, we will win. It will be a victory not only for Ukraine, it will be a victory for all our partners and friends,"" Andriy Yermak stressed. Asked whether he considers changes in Russia's imperial policy possible, the Head of the President's Office said that, unfortunately, there is only a language of force and blackmail in Russia's political culture. ""So I think that historically, if we all, the democratic free world, win, then in the long run it might happen. But now Russia can sit down at the negotiating table only if what I said above happens: weapons, sanctions and a consolidated position of the whole democratic world. And, of course, Ukraine's victory on the frontline,"" he said. Andriy Yermak also noted that many Ukrainian children were forcibly deported to Russia and the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. At the initiative of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a special group has already begun to search for these children and prevent illegal procedures against them. According to Andriy Yermak, possible mediation in these issues would be very important and would be welcomed by Ukraine. The Head of the President's Office stressed the urgency of food security issue in the world given Russia's blockade of Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Work is currently underway with the United Nations, the United States, the United Kingdom and Turkey on how to unblock ports and create humanitarian corridors so that Ukrainian agricultural products can be exported. Answering questions about the situation with internally displaced persons in our country and opportunities to help them, Andriy Yermak said that there are state support programs, and Ukraine also welcomes any initiatives by partners to help these people, including participation in rapid construction of temporary housing for them. To implement such projects, he suggested establishing cooperation between the relevant government officials of Ukraine and Ireland."
Speech by Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak at a meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence of the Irish Parliament,2022-06-01T09:20:00Z,"Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for the opportunity to speak here today. For three months now, we have been resisting one of the world's largest armies. I am sure you are among those Europeans who do not need explanations why we are doing this. You just know it. If suddenly not - you can ask Bono and Edge of U2 about it. They played in the Kyiv metro while an air alarm sounded on the surface. They saw everything. And when Bono said that we are fighting not only for our own, but also for your freedom, he was right. This is actually true. Today, without exaggeration, we are the shield of Europe. Ireland was among those states that extended a helping hand to Ukraine in the first hours of the full-scale Russian invasion. We are very grateful to the people and Government of Ireland for their support, for the immediate abolition of visas and for the creation of the most favorable conditions for refugees from Ukraine. We are also thankful for the consistent position that the Republic of Ireland has taken throughout the eight years of Russian aggression against Ukraine on the need to comply with international law and non-recognition of the annexation of illegally occupied territories of our country. In these eight years, the world has failed to stop Russia. It failed to restrain its imperial intentions. Unpunished evil always becomes stronger, always becomes more ambitious. But Ukraine did not surrender. It has been resisting for more than three months already. The Kremlin cannot conquer it. And so it resorted to the destruction. It began to destroy its industrial and economic potential. Regular missile and air strikes, artillery shelling of settlements and critical infrastructure are carried out exactly for this purpose. The looting of the occupied territories of Ukraine is large-scale and systematic. And this indicates that looting is the basis of Russia's public policy in these lands. Hundreds of thousands of tons of Ukrainian grain have already been taken to Russia from the southern regions, which are under the control of Russian troops. At the same time, Russia refuses to provide green corridors for the export of our agricultural products. This is an obvious blackmail of the world community with food shortages, as before the war Ukraine was the guarantor of food security for 400 million people on the planet. This is already the fourth type of blackmail used by the Kremlin during the aggression against Ukraine. It was preceded by threats of energy shortage in the European Union, a possible catastrophe at one of the seized Ukrainian nuclear power plants, and a nuclear strike. We do not know what else Russia's actions in its longing for domination can lead to. But we know for sure: it must be stopped. It is very difficult for us now. As a result of hostilities, 5 million people left the country. The number of internally displaced persons is the same. Tens of thousands of civilians have been killed in the Russian invasion. The war took away 35% of Ukraine's GDP. We lost more than 200 factories. Our direct losses today exceed $ 600 billion. Nevertheless, Ukraine continues to defend itself. Fierce fighting continues in the east and south. We have to win. Otherwise, Ukraine will simply disappear as a nation and as a state. The more help the international community provides, the closer our victory is. Any help - military-technical, political, financial or humanitarian. An extremely strong support for Ukraine in deterring aggression is increasing sanctions pressure on Russia. I would like to talk about the International Expert Group set up at the initiative of President Zelenskyy, which I have the honor to chair with Ambassador Michael McFaul, and which has already presented two documents: the Sanctions Strengthening Plan and the Sanctions Roadmap, which contain detailed recommendations for a coordinated and coherent sanctions policy. Ukraine welcomes the EU's move to implement the Sixth Sanction Package. A key part of it is a complete embargo on Russian oil. This should be done as soon as possible. Energy accounts for the lion's share of Russia's budget revenues. So, buying them, Europe is financing the Russian military machine. The European Union is responding to Russia's aggression by gradually building up sanctions and gradually increasing arms supplies to Ukraine. It is too long and inefficient. We propose to change the approach. It is necessary to do what the Russians do not expect. A massive sanctions strike, intensified by the maximum number of heavy weapons for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, will not only help save thousands of lives. It will also help avoid a protracted war, for which Russia has already prepared. We ask you to convey to the partners in the European Parliament the importance of such an approach. We will also be grateful for the political and any other assistance in obtaining the weapons that Ukraine desperately needs. Equally important is the fact that the continuation of sanctions pressure on Russia will serve as a safeguard against further attempts at aggression against Ukraine, along with other security guarantees mechanisms. The relevant expert group, which I co-chair with former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, is already working on possible ways to establish these mechanisms. We would be glad to see representatives of Ireland - a country with extensive experience in peacekeeping - in it. Availing myself of this opportunity, I would like to congratulate Ireland on its Chairmanship of the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers. But I would like to propose that the Committee's agenda include compliance by Member States with their obligations under the common sanctions policy. Investigating the crimes of Russian troops could be another issue on Ukraine's agenda of the Committee. I think it is no exaggeration to say that Ireland is Europe's technological and financial hub. Sometimes transnational companies try to do business as usual until the last opportunity. But in the case of Russia, business as usual is promoting aggression. No matter what the business is. Moscow has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to use even humanitarian cooperation as part of a hybrid war. We must not forget that this always ends in provocation of civil conflicts, sabotage and political assassinations. When we ask for help, we are not talking about charity. This is an investment. In common European security. In a common European future. It is from such positions that we consider the prospects of joining the EU. Ukraine paid a very high price for its choice. And still continues to pay. And in this matter, every vote in support of it is important. Therefore, I would like to ask those present here to make every effort to turn Ukraine's European perspective into a reality as soon as possible. We have often heard that Ukraine's accession to the EU is hampered by corruption. Well, it's true: Russia-incited corruption in the EU has indeed become a stumbling block for us. But this must end. We were delighted with the actions of your fishermen, who protected the exclusive economic zone of Ireland from the exercises of the Russian fleet. It was a very elegant and beautiful move. Certainly, the glorious Irish cleverness will be useful to Ukrainians. Both today and after the war, when we will rebuild our green country. I bet Johnny Cash could count 40 shades of green in Ukraine as well - at least once every six months. Our government is already working on the U24 Recovery Plan. Ukraine's reconstruction will be based on two principles: regional and parametric. The regional principle will be based on the help of partners to rebuild a particular region, city or community. Parametric means that the restoration will take place according to modern parameters and standards of the European Union. We invite Ireland to participate in this program. Following President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, I invite Ireland to help us with the restoration of the Kherson region. We have a very wide space for cooperation. Agriculture, pharmaceuticals, food industry, mechanical engineering, services - you name it. I will place a special emphasis on the capabilities of the IT sector. Even before the war, Ukraine introduced a revolutionary tax regime in this area - Diya.City. It continues to work effectively even in the current circumstances. Our future security will depend, among other things, on our ability to adapt and implement technologies such as artificial intelligence, autonomous management and cybersecurity. Ukraine could cooperate with Ireland as a high-tech country on these issues. As you say, success is about getting up one time more than falling. This is exactly what we need. So help us get up. I am sure you will see that Ukraine knows how to show its gratitude. Thank you very much for your attention!"
"Everyone should be a lobbyist for the supply of heavy weapons to Ukraine, which can speed up our victory - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-05-31T22:35:00Z,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! Finally, we have the specifics about the European Union's sixth sanctions package on Russia for this war. The package was agreed. Its approval and entry into force will take some time. But the key elements of the package are already clear, and most importantly - its direction. European countries have agreed to significantly limit oil imports from Russia. And I am grateful to everyone who worked to reach this agreement. The practical result is minus tens of billions of euros, which Russia will now be unable to use to finance terror. But it is also important to understand that European countries' abandonment of Russian oil and other fossil fuels will accelerate the transition to renewable energy sources. Strategically, this leaves the Russian state on the sidelines of the modern economy. With such an aggressive policy and a course of isolation from the civilized world, Russia simply will not be able to adapt. So, it will lose. Lose economically. We are also looking forward to the disconnection of one of the largest Russian banks - Sberbank - from SWIFT within the sixth sanctions package. Finally, there is the cessation of broadcasting of Russian disinformation channels in Europe. And new personal sanctions. We will also work on new restrictions against Russia for this war. As soon as the sixth package starts working, we will start preparing the seventh. After all, there must be no significant economic relations of the free word with the terrorist state. I discussed further sanctions policy of the European Union with President of Slovakia Zuzana Čaputová. I am grateful to her, a true friend of Ukraine, for today's visit to Kyiv, for substantive negotiations and for an inspiring speech in the Verkhovna Rada. From the first days of the full-scale war, Slovakia has become one of our most important defense partners. And we will continue this cooperation. We also talked today about Ukraine's European movement. Mrs. Zuzana personally helps accelerate the integration of our state. And we will always be grateful for that. We are also preparing solutions for more effective management of processes at the borders of our states. In particular, joint customs control. At the beginning of her visit to Ukraine, the President of Slovakia visited Irpin and Borodyanka and saw with her own eyes the destruction caused by the Russian army. Anyone who sees this for themselves no longer needs to be persuaded why Russia must bear maximum responsibility for this war. I believe that Slovakia will provide all the necessary assistance to bring to justice all Russian war criminals and to rebuild everything they destroyed after the war. Today I would also like to address those in Ukraine who are trying, so to speak, to ""hurry up"" the Armed Forces of our state or to indicate how to attack and where to repel enemies in the first place. Ukraine values every opinion. But Ukraine values every life first and foremost. And this is an axiom. And Ukraine will never do like Russia, which throws people into hell of battles just because Moscow wanted to seize something in a few days or by a certain date. Our military, intelligence, the National Guard and all those involved in the defense of the state are gradually but inevitably thwarting all the plans of the occupiers. The frontline situation must be assessed comprehensively. Not by one area, where there is the most tough situation and which attracts the most attention, but by the whole frontline. The situation in the Donbas direction is very difficult. Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Kurakhove are now at the epicenter of the confrontation. Given the presence of large-scale chemical production in Severodonetsk, the Russian army's strikes there, including blind air bombing, are just madness. But on the 97th day of such a war, it is no longer surprising that for the Russian military, for Russian commanders, for Russian soldiers, any madness is absolutely acceptable. We have certain success in the Kherson direction, as well as an advancement in the Kharkiv region. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are rebuffing the pressure of the occupiers in the Zaporizhzhia region, the key direction is Hulyaipole and Orikhiv. In this broad picture, it must be seen that our defenders are showing the utmost courage and remain masters of the frontline situation, despite the fact that the Russian army still has a significant advantage in equipment and numbers. Of course, everyone in Ukraine wants all our territories, all our people to be liberated today, as soon as possible. The full restoration of the territorial integrity of our state is our goal. But we must act carefully, valuing life. Everyone at all levels must now be lobbyists for the supply of modern heavy weapons and modern artillery to our state. All those systems that can really speed up the victory of Ukraine. Talk about it wherever it is useful and wherever it is heard. Speak to the politicians of the partner countries, to the representatives of foreign media, even to your friends abroad. This narrative of the need to provide Ukraine with enough weapons to win must be maintained constantly. I work for this every day. I signed a new decree on awarding our heroes. 215 combatants were awarded state awards, 17 of them - posthumously. Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all who are fighting for our independence! Glory to Ukraine!"
"President of Ukraine: Our plan is to deoccupy our entire territory, and we don't care about Russia’s plans",2022-05-31T18:58:00Z,"The situation on the eastern frontline is currently difficult due to the lack of necessary weapons, but Ukraine will liberate its territories focusing on the effectiveness of hostilities and the maximum preservation of people's lives. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a meeting with media representatives following talks with President of the Slovak Republic Zuzana Čaputová in Kyiv. ""In the east, it is difficult for us because of the lack of appropriate weapons... If our steps or operations to deoccupy this or that region cost tens of thousands of our dead people, we will wait for appropriate weapons to save as many of our people as possible. It is they who de-occupy the territory. Because, to be honest, these territories without living Ukrainians are not a priority for us. Therefore, I believe that first of all we should think as much as possible about our people who are able to repel all the plans of the Russian Federation,"" the President said. According to him, Ukraine plans to de-occupy all its territories that belong to it in accordance with international law. ""This is our plan. As for the plans (of the Russian Federation - ed.), June 1 or July 1, or August 1 - at least not September 1 yet, maybe on September 1 they will have other plans... We do not care about Russia's plans,"" the President said."
Slovakia will continue to provide maximum security assistance to Ukraine - Volodymyr Zelenskyy following the meeting with Zuzana Čaputová in Kyiv,2022-05-31T18:35:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with President of the Slovak Republic Zuzana Čaputová who is on a visit to our country. Greeting Zuzana Čaputová in Kyiv, he stressed that Slovakia had taken a principled position and supported Ukraine from the very beginning of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation. ""The Slovak people fully support Ukraine and the citizens of our country in the struggle for freedom and realize that it is a struggle for our common freedom and common values of a free, united Europe,"" said the Ukrainian Head of State during a meeting with media representatives after the talks with the President of the Slovak Republic. The key topics of the meeting were defense and economic assistance to Ukraine, support for granting our country the status of a candidate for EU membership, as well as strengthening sanctions against Russia. ""Slovakia's contribution to strengthening our defense capabilities is really significant. I also highly appreciate the personal role of the President in providing defense assistance to Ukraine. This cooperation of ours is based on the common vision that a reliable peace in Ukraine and in the whole of Europe is possible only on the basis of full restoration of territorial integrity and respect for the sovereignty of our state. And I was assured that Slovakia will continue to provide maximum security assistance to Ukraine,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. He also said that Ukraine and Slovakia have a common view on the need to strengthen sanctions against Russia. ""A situation where more than 50 days have passed between the fifth and sixth sanctions packages against Russia is not acceptable. It is good that we see progress in approving the EU's sixth sanctions package. I hope that the sixth package will be approved in the near future,"" the Ukrainian Head of State stressed. According to him, the key restrictions that should motivate Russia to end the war should apply to the Russian energy sector as an energy weapon. The Presidents also discussed Ukraine's European integration and agreed on further steps on Slovakia's support for granting the EU candidate status to our country. In addition, during the meeting the parties discussed cooperation on border infrastructure and the operation of checkpoints. ""We are moving towards the introduction of joint control at the borders of neighboring countries. We are grateful for Slovakia's willingness to help create new routes and hubs for the export of agricultural products and other critical goods from Ukraine. This is a significant support for our economy in the context of Russia's blockade of Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea and the Azov coast. Such cooperation of ours is also important for global food security,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. The leaders discussed financial support for Ukraine, Slovakia's involvement in post-war reconstruction and assistance to Ukrainians who have been forced to leave their homes temporarily due to the war. ""Today, 78,000 Ukrainians have taken refuge in friendly Slovakia, 31,000 of them are children. Mrs. President told me that more than 400,000 people had crossed the border. Almost 450,000 Ukrainians felt like home in the friendly Slovak Republic. I am very grateful for such support. Ukrainian migrants received a warm and sincere attitude. And I am confident that cooperation between our states will make it possible to do everything so that Ukrainian migrants can return home to Ukraine as soon as possible,"" the Ukrainian President said. For her part, the President of the Slovak Republic noted that her visit to Ukraine is aimed to demonstrate the support for our state and the Ukrainian government. Zuzana Čaputová said that during her visit she had visited Borodyanka in the Kyiv region and had been deeply shocked by the consequences of the Russian invasion. ""I saw concentrated evil,"" she said. The President of Slovakia stressed that her country had supported Ukraine from the very beginning by providing humanitarian, political and military assistance. ""We have a clear position that we will not be able to stop Russia's aggression with medications and hygienic wipes alone. You are waging a fair defensive war, so we consider it fair to help you,"" Zuzana Čaputová noted. She reminded that Slovakia had provided Ukraine with the S-300 system, demining equipment, and supported the imposition of sanctions on Russia. In addition, her country supports granting Ukraine candidate status on the path to EU membership. ""I could talk to you about how the whole democratic world looks at your courage, your determination and your personal leadership, Mr. President. This is important and valuable,"" Zuzana Čaputová emphasized."
Olena Zelenska discussed with Queen Mathilde of Belgium the National Program of Mental Health and Psychosocial Support for War Victims in Ukraine,2022-05-31T17:53:00Z,"Wife of the President of Ukraine Olena Zelenska had a phone conversation with Her Majesty Queen Mathilde of Belgium, during which the National Program of Mental Health and Psychosocial Support developed at the initiative of the First Lady was discussed. The program aims to help Ukrainians overcome the extreme stress and consequences of the traumatic events of the war. Her Majesty is a professional psychologist and advocates for global mental health as a UN Advocate for Sustainable Development. Olena Zelenska invited Queen Mathilde to join the development of the program, as Belgium has successfully reformed the adult mental health system and introduced a new policy on the mental health of children and adolescents. Therefore, such an experience would be extremely useful for Ukraine. ""I am especially worried about the children in this regard. They see too much. We have the example of an 18-year-old boy who witnessed his mother's death and took care of four younger siblings. He can't talk about what happened without tears. And this is not an isolated case, children are traumatized by the deaths of loved ones, military brutality, loss of home. We have to save their psyche during the war,"" said the First Lady. Her Majesty assured: Ukraine can count on the solidarity and assistance of the Belgian people. In particular, Dr. Hans Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe, has extensive working experience in hotspots, having participated in Médecins Sans Frontières missions in Liberia and Somalia. Therefore, according to Queen Mathilde, he can pass on to Ukraine all the practices that were successfully applied during the reform of the Belgian mental health system. The program is to strengthen the public sector through cooperation with non-governmental organizations. It provides training for mental health professionals, as well as family physicians, educators and community social workers. The training will cover a wide range of issues, from basic communication and support skills to specialized practices for dealing with the consequences of emergencies. ""We want them all to be able to adopt the best world experience and the latest practices. We have very little time, we can't spend it on experiments, so we count on the support of the international community to develop and implement the program as soon as possible,"" Olena Zelenska stressed. The President's wife also thanked Her Majesty the Queen and the Belgians for their support, as the country has already sheltered more than 80,000 Ukrainian IDPs."
Spain supports Ukraine's European integration progress - Ihor Zhovkva,2022-05-31T14:37:00Z,"During a working visit to the Kingdom of Spain, Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Ihor Zhovkva held a number of meetings with representatives of the Government and Parliament of this country. During the talks with Minister of Foreign Affairs, the European Union and Cooperation of the Kingdom of Spain José Manuel Albares Bueno, the issue of granting Ukraine the status of a candidate for EU membership was discussed in the context of the European Council meeting to be held on June 23-24. In addition, the parties stressed the importance of strengthening the defense capabilities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine by supplying our country with heavy weapons. ""Restricting Russia's access to funds and technology should weaken its readiness to launch constant strikes at Ukraine's territory and replenish its military capabilities,"" Ihor Zhovkva said. The interlocutors exchanged views on the possibilities of involving Spanish business in the reconstruction of certain regions and cities of Ukraine destroyed by Russian aggression. The Deputy Head of the Office of the President informed the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Spain about the establishment of new channels for the export of Ukrainian grain to the European and world markets. Ihor Zhovkva also took part in an event marking the 40th anniversary of Spain's accession to NATO, attended by King Felipe VI of Spain, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. An important topic raised by the speakers was the need to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities against the background of Russian aggression. The Deputy Head of the Office of the President discussed with First Vice President of the Spanish Congress of Deputies Alfonso Rodríguez Gómez de Celis and Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Spanish Congress of Deputies Pau Mari-Klose the importance of strengthening inter-parliamentary contacts between our countries. Ihor Zhovkva thanked the Spanish people for their support for the temporarily displaced Ukrainian citizens. During the meeting with Secretary of State for the European Union of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the European Union and Cooperation of the Kingdom of Spain Pascual Ignacio Navarro Ríos, the focus was on Ukraine's practical steps towards full membership in the European Union. Ihor Zhovkva stressed that Ukraine's achievements in reforms, market integration and the stability of institutions during the war are important prerequisites for accelerated integration into the European Union. He expressed hope that a positive conclusion from the European Commission would be received soon and that Spain would support granting Ukraine the status of a candidate country in the near future.   ""Ukrainian society has already proved its Europeanness, so our expectations for the status of a candidate country in June are reasonable, justified and labored,"" said Ihor Zhovkva. At the meeting with Secretary General of Defense Policy of Spain Admiral Juan Francisco Martínez Núñez, the cooperation between Ukraine and Spain in the military-technical sphere was discussed. The Deputy Head of the Office of the President thanked for the military assistance received from Spain and expressed hope for its increase in order to strengthen resistance to Russian military aggression. During working meetings with Diplomatic Adviser to Prime Minister of Spain Emma Aparici Vázquez de Parga and Director of the Spanish EU Presidency Coordination Office María Aurora Mejía Errasquín, the issues of practical implementation of Ukraine's European integration strategy and the possibility of using advisory and other practical assistance from the Spanish government were discussed. Ihor Zhovkva praised the active position of Mayor of Madrid José Luis Martínez-Almeida in support of Ukraine, in particular in the organization of the May 28, 2022 marathon ""Run for Ukraine. Run for peace"". According to preliminary estimates, the event held in the downtown of the Spanish capital and dedicated to supporting Ukraine's status as a candidate for EU membership brought together more than 3,000 participants. As part of the visit of the Deputy Head of the President's Office, a ceremony of launching the “Spain with Ukraine” postage stamp was also held. In the premises of the Spanish Post Office, Ihor Zhovkva together with Chairman Juan Manuel Serrano Quintana took part in the ceremony of cancellation of the first samples of this first Spanish stamp dedicated to Ukraine."
"In any case, Europe will have to give up Russian oil and oil products, because it is about the independence of Europeans themselves from Russia's energy weapons - address by the President of Ukraine",2022-05-30T23:28:00Z,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today, one of the key tasks of the day was communication for the approval of the sixth package of sanctions by the European Union. The pause in agreeing on new sanctions in Europe has been too long. The fifth sanctions package was introduced on April 8. So, a lot of time has passed without strengthening European sanctions against Russia. I emphasized that this should finally be corrected - and corrected immediately - in my address to the leaders of European countries who gathered for a meeting of the European Council. In particular, to discuss this issue. I am grateful to Charles Michel, President of the European Council, for supporting the interests of Ukraine, the interests of the whole of Europe and for trying to find the necessary compromises as soon as possible so that the European Union's sixth sanctions package can be adopted. Russia must feel a much higher price for its aggression. The key point is, of course, the oil. I believe that Europe will have to give up Russian oil and oil products in any case. Because this is about the independence of Europeans themselves from Russian energy weapons. And the sooner this happens, the more complete the abandonment of Russian oil will be, the greater the benefit will be for Europe itself in the end. I also spoke today about strengthening sanctions with the Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of France. Catherine Colonna paid a visit to Kyiv. In addition to sanctions, we also discussed the issues of defense support for Ukraine, our European integration and the need to act much faster to prevent the escalation of the food crisis in the world. Now, due to the fact that Russia has blocked our ports in the Black Sea and seized our part of the coast of the Sea of Azov, we cannot export 22 million tons of grain that are already in warehouses in our country. This is the volume that was to enter the foreign market. And Russia's blockade of our exports is destabilizing the situation on a global scale. As a result, food is becoming increasingly expensive in different countries. Consequently, there is a threat of famine. In Africa, in Asia, in some European countries. This threat could escalate into a new migrant crisis. And this is what the Russian leadership clearly wants. They are deliberately creating this problem. So that the whole of Europe faces difficulties. And so that Ukraine does not receive billions of dollars for its exports. These are the billions that our economy really needs now. And the inhabitants of African and Asian countries are used by the Russian state simply as a bargaining chip. Against this background, the stories of Russian officials at various levels that some sanctions allegedly do not allow them to increase exports of their food look particularly cynical. As if they allegedly want to prevent a crisis, but sanctions allegedly hinder them. It is clear that they are lying, as always. First, Russian food was not blocked by sanctions. And secondly, in our occupied territory, the Russian invaders have already stolen at least half a million tons of grain and are now looking for ways to illegally sell it somewhere. To sell it in a way to make money on what was stolen and to keep the deficit in the legal market. I spoke today with Turkish President Erdoğan, in particular, about this threat to food security. About how to ensure normal traffic from Ukrainian Black Sea ports. And, of course, about how to speed up the end of this war - Russia's war against our state. We also discussed further defense cooperation between Ukraine and Turkey. Today in the Luhansk region, the occupiers disrupted the evacuation from the areas of hostilities by firing at a car following the locals. French journalist Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff was killed by the shelling. He worked for the French TV channel BFM TV. A little over a month ago, I gave an interview to this particular TV channel. This was my first interview with the French media during a full-scale war. My sincere condolences to Frédéric's colleagues and family. He became the 32nd media representative killed after February 24. The situation in Donbas remains extremely difficult. The Russian army is trying to gather overwhelming forces in certain areas to put more and more pressure on our defenders. There, in Donbas, the maximum combat power of the Russian army is now gathered. Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Kurakhove, Slovyansk and some other settlements remain key targets for the occupiers in this direction. And I am grateful to all our defenders who, despite the technical and sometimes quantitative advantage of the occupiers, heroically hold the defense. Today, Russian troops shelled Kharkiv again. The territory of our Sumy region was also shelled across the border between Ukraine and Russia. The struggle for the Kherson region continues. Step by step, we are liberating our land and gradually approaching the point where Russia will have to lay down its arms, count all its dead and move to diplomacy. Definitely have to. Eternal glory to everyone who defends the independence of Ukraine! Eternal memory to all who died at the hands of the occupiers. Glory to Ukraine!"
We can't agree on Minsk-3 because it's a ticket to a postponed war; we need an agreement on security guarantees - Mykhailo Podolyak,2022-05-30T21:41:00Z,"Any agreement between Ukraine and the Russian Federation like Minsk-3 is a postponed war that will bring much more victims and risks to the existence of our state. At the same time, concluding an agreement on security guarantees is a matter of a proper end to the war in Europe. Mykhailo Podolyak, Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine and a member of the Ukrainian delegation at the negotiations with Russia, said this in an interview with LB.ua. According to him, due to the strong Russian lobby and their own indecision, some politicians in Europe are beginning to say that Ukraine must stop fighting and make some ""peace"" with Russia in the current positions. So far, individual political groups are talking about this, and this does not mean that Europe will refuse to support Ukraine. But this means that today it is difficult for our country to prove the need to provide the Ukrainian army with heavy weapons. ""Because Europe believes that we must stand where we stand today. And they directly say: God forbid, some Ukrainian projectile will hit the territory of the Russian Federation. That is, Europe is gradually starting to say strange things,"" Mykhailo Podolyak said. ""We can't support any of the options that are being talked about. We can't agree on Minsk-3 - that's obvious. Because it's a ticket to a postponed war. We cannot talk about a ceasefire before the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. It is clear that they will dig trenches, create their own fortification lines, and it will be very difficult for us to drive them out of Ukraine. We cannot agree to any ultimatum from Russia, because it will mean that they win. And any, even small victory of Russia only means escalation. Russia is an expansionist state, which offers the world one idea: we will enter any territory and take it away or destroy it,"" said the Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President. According to him, the public opinion of the Western world is definitely on the side of Ukraine, and European politicians, to please their societies, say that they provide a lot of help to our state, but in terms of the amount we need, this is not the case at all. ""Russia has concentrated all possible resources in the east of our country, from all its military districts. They have been conducting covert mobilization since April 1. And we are not a military state, we lived in another world, invested money in development,"" he said. Mykhailo Podolyak is convinced that if Europe supports any pro-Russian concepts, in particular on forcing Ukraine to make territorial concessions, it will mean that Europe is dying. The Adviser to the Head of the President's Office noted that the negotiation process between Ukraine and Russia is currently suspended in the political and diplomatic part, but it is continued in the humanitarian part - on the exchange of prisoners, humanitarian corridors and evacuation of people. ""Why has the political and diplomatic part been stopped? Because negotiations are a question of inter-relation between what is happening in the real world, not only on the battlefield, but in general: sanctions, reputation, partners. Russia is inadequately looking at all this. This is a phenomenon that will also be included in textbooks,"" Mykhailo Podolyak is convinced. At the same time, according to him, when the Russians begin to suffer significant military defeats in Ukraine, they will probably assess the reality more adequately. ""When the pressure of sanctions works in full, they will begin to understand. When certain leaders, especially European ones, with whom they are still communicating, start talking not as Kissinger, but as anti-Kissinger. Then they will look at the situation more objectively,"" said the Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President. He noted that President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is best informed about the economic, military situation and the psychological state of society, may decide that a certain tool, including negotiations, is needed right now. ""This will be the decision of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief given the operational situation as of the day when he will make such a decision,"" Mykhailo Podolyak explained. He reiterated that any so-called Minsk-3 is a war postponed for a year. ""What does this mean for us? Many more victims and greater risks to Ukraine's existence. Because if Russia doesn't lose, it will accumulate weapons, prepare reserves, work on mistakes, remove generals who work very ""effectively"" today, take young lieutenant colonels and colonels who understand how to fight, and we will get a much bloodier war in a year. We have no chance to compromise and make concessions,"" said the Adviser to the Head of the President's Office. Therefore, according to him, Ukraine needs an agreement on security guarantees. ""The issue of guarantees is a matter of the proper end of the war in Europe. That is, we return to the key thing - the willingness of the global elite to take responsibility. Because just forming an alliance is one story, and taking responsibility, for example, on the border with the Russian Federation, is another,” he said. Mykhailo Podolyak also said that for him personally the victory of our state would mean the following: ""This is territorial integrity within the full, internationally recognized borders of Ukraine, the Iron Curtain with Russia, Russia's worthless, completely zero reputation."""
Address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the European Council,2022-05-30T20:14:00Z,"Dear Mr. President Michel. Dear Mrs. President Roberta. Dear friends! I am glad to be able to address all of you without exception. Today is the 96th day of Russia's full-scale war against our state, against all of us and against all of you. Against European unity. Russia wants to see at such meetings not a united European Council that we see now, not a united European Union, but 27 separate states, 27 fragments that cannot be put together. This is their wish. This policy of the aggressor is consistent, and there is no delay in it. Unlike Europe, Russia does not need to hold such summits and seek compromises for weeks. By the way, I want to thank you for talking about these compromises, for striving to find help and support for Ukraine. So, they are not ready to compromise, choosing what to do to achieve their goals. And now we see how the Russian offensive in Donbas is destroying our cities, destroying the communities of Ukraine, and at the same time how the European unity, the desired European unity may falter. On April 8, the 44th day of the war, the EU's fifth sanctions package was imposed. And 52 days have passed since then. What happened during this period? At that time, as of April 8, there were 169 children on the list of those killed by the Russian occupiers in Ukraine. As of today 243 children are on the list. At that time, as of April 8, 928 educational institutions were destroyed. Kindergartens, schools, universities. As of today – 1888. According to the information for the past day, the number of Russian missile strikes at Ukraine is already almost 1,600. Russia has used more than 2,400, almost 2,500 different missiles against us, against the civilian population. And then, as of April 8, there were less than a thousand strikes and they used about a thousand missiles. This is the progress of their aggression. And, of course, I want you to understand me - I'm not blaming any of you. It is only the Russian state that is to blame for everything that is happening. But I am convinced that it is obvious to each and every one of you that there should be progress in sanctions for this aggression. And for us it is crucial. And it will help us a lot! The progress that makes Russia begin to seek peace. And only this can be our common demand. Peace. There can be no compromises at the expense of our territorial integrity, our sovereignty! I am grateful to everyone who promotes the sixth sanctions package and tries to make it effective. However, unfortunately, for some reason it is not there yet. And why do you depend on Russia, on their pressure, not vice versa? Russia must depend on you. Why can Russia still earn almost a billion euros a day by selling energy resources? Why are banks of a terrorist state still working with Europe and the global financial system? Serious questions. And why are Russian propaganda channels still active in the European Union? This is an information weapon of the Russian Federation. Why are Russian civil servants who support the war and judges who openly support repression still not under sanctions? Each of these important questions is not just about sanctions packages or the war in Ukraine. All this is about us. All this is about Europe itself. Dear friends! Ladies and Gentlemen! Only through greater unity can we find effective responses to everything that Russia is doing against us and against you. If someone torpedoes a ship, one or more cabins cannot hope to stay afloat when others drown. You can see that the consequences of Russia's aggression have gone beyond our continent. And they will definitely return with even bigger problems for the whole of Europe. For example, large-scale famine in Africa and Asia will mean a threat of a new large-scale migrant crisis for southern and south-eastern Europe. And when you hear food blackmail from Moscow, please know that this is their deliberate strike at your societies. To ensure this strike, Russia simply uses the people of Africa and Asia as hostages, deliberately pushing them to starvation. So that people from there flee to you en masse. Are you ready for this? I don't think so. Let's take a look at price instability in the energy market. It's not just some of the usual market fluctuations periodically observed. Last year, Russia created conditions for the record increase in gas prices. Now, investing in instability, Russia is making all energy prices skyrocket. For what? For Europeans to protest, not against the aggressor and their aggression, but against their own states. Against you personally. Against their leadership. And if this is a threat to each and every one of you, if this is Russia's bet on political chaos in your countries, why do some people still think they can defend themselves alone? Europe must show strength. Because Russia perceives only strength as an argument. It's time. It’s time for you to be not separate, not fragments, but one whole. Ukraine has shown by its own example why this is important. Why it's important to be united. In our country, starting from February 24 there is the maximum unity, everyone is working for one result - state protection. And thanks to this we managed to do what the world did not expect, Russia did not expect - Ukraine stopped their army, and everyone was afraid of it, everyone remembers. And we managed to liberate part of our occupied territory. Greater unity is truly the foundation of this strength. You know this. Finally, all quarrels in Europe must end, internal discord that only encourages Russia to put more and more pressure on you, on the whole of Europe. The sixth sanctions package must be agreed upon. It must be effective - including oil. So that Russia feels the price of what it is doing against Ukraine and against the whole of Europe. And for you and us to finally become independent from Russian energy weapons. At least from its oil part. And we must immediately find a solution that will prevent the food crisis from unfolding. Of course, I thank you for your efforts together with partners to create green corridors for agricultural exports from Ukraine. But still, you understand that a reliable guarantee of food security is impossible without ending Russia's war against Ukraine on our land. Because there can be no peaceful trade, no steady agricultural production, if Russia retains the ability to intercept ships with Ukrainian agricultural products. And not only in the Black Sea. Or to strike at our cities, ports, elevators, other infrastructure. Mr. President Michel! You were recently in Odesa and were forced to go into a shelter due to a missile attack. Mr. President has felt for himself what I am talking about now. And if this was felt even at such level, why is Russia still not recognized as a terrorist state, a state - sponsor of terrorism? And another aspect. The European home was never complete without Ukraine. It won’t be. There will never be a full-fledged European power without Ukraine. The very fact that Ukraine remained a fragment of Europe, somewhere outside your countries, contributed to the fact that Russia has developed an aggressive appetite to seize its neighbors. Only the enlargement and strengthening of European unity can prevent the recurrence of what Europe experienced on February 24, in 2014, and even in 1968 or 1956. Therefore - at the strategic level - the status of a candidate for membership in the European Union for Ukraine should be approved already in June. I would like to express gratitude to the countries of the Western Balkans for their understanding and support for granting candidate status to our country. Thank you very much. On April 8, when the fifth sanctions package was approved, we also received a questionnaire from the European Union. And we have already answered it over this time. We have already provided these answers to the European Commission. Unprecedentedly fast, and most importantly - in a coordinated manner. We expect the same reaction from Europe. And we reject any attempt to find an alternative that no one needs, or to find something else for Ukraine. We need to be like you. We want Ukraine to receive candidate status. We have met all the necessary criteria for this status. And I am sure that those individual states that are still hesitant about us, you know it well, will change their minds and show our united strength. The strength of our nations who support our membership in the European Union by an unprecedented majority. The strength of your nations, the strength of your states and a united Europe. I want to thank you for your unity, ability to be united, energetic, to have a future in a strong European Union and to ensure that the developments in the world depend on us. So that we depend on ourselves, not on some offices somewhere in Moscow. Right now you can determine whether everything that the European Union says about itself is true. About unity in diversity, common values and the same approach to all European democracies. We need a common customs space that will strengthen both Ukraine and all those involved in trade with us. We need a common payment space that will accelerate integration at the level of ordinary people. And a common roaming space. It is very important for our displaced people, more than 5 million of them, not to experience discrimination. And, of course, further armed and financial support for Ukraine is absolutely necessary. Now our common freedom depends on our success on the battlefield, and your stability depends on our stability. And this is another reason to find and freeze, and then confiscate all Russian assets and allocate them for the reconstruction and compensation for the damage caused by the war. Dear colleagues! Dear friends! We have already started a conversation with most of you about rebuilding Ukraine. We are creating a large-scale recovery plan. The global United24 support project has been activated. The European Commission is also preparing a platform for reconstruction. I urge all of you to join these initiatives now. If rebuilding begins during the war and becomes truly pan-European, it will be one of the most convincing pieces of evidence for everyone and, of course, for Russia in particular, that Europeans are strong. And they will not allow any of the integral parts of Europe to be destroyed. Neither Ukraine nor any other part. And finally. A 9-year-old girl died today as a result of the Russian shelling of the Kherson region of Ukraine. Two more children were wounded: a 7-month-old baby and a 5-year-old girl. A normal person can’t just put up with it. With such crimes. Daily crimes. These are the deliberate killings by the Russian military of our civilians, our children. They know exactly who they are firing at. And I really count on your principledness and activity to bring to justice every Russian soldier who killed or tortured our people, and every commander who gave or condoned such orders. Europe can definitely do that. Let's do it! Because this is not just a question of the aggressor's responsibility for a particular war, but of protecting humanity as such. Thank you for your attention. Glory to Ukraine!"
President of Ukraine met with the Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of France,2022-05-30T18:21:00Z,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had a meeting with Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of France Catherine Colonna, who is on a visit to Ukraine. The President noted the importance of the visit of the Minister to Ukraine, which is another manifestation of the support for our country by the French Republic. ""I want to thank you, France and President Emmanuel Macron for supporting Ukraine, for the constant support for our territorial integrity and sovereignty,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The interlocutors discussed the key issues for our country's victory: assistance in armaments, strengthening sanctions and bringing our country closer to EU membership. Special attention was paid to the issue of unblocking Ukrainian ports in order to prevent the global food crisis. The Head of State stressed that Ukraine counts on France's leadership in our fight against the Russian aggressor and the protection of European values. During the meeting, the parties stressed the need to introduce the next, sixth package of sanctions against Russia by the EU as soon as possible. The President noted that Ukraine counts on the support of France for the decision of the leaders of the European Union to grant our country the status of a candidate for EU membership in June. ""We have repeatedly heard that friendly France sees Ukraine in the European Union,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. During the discussion of Russia's use of food security as a weapon in the war against Ukraine, the President called on French partners not to give in to the aggressor's blackmail and pressure to mitigate the sanctions against Moscow.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked in particular for the financial support for our state and the assistance of the French government in the treatment of wounded Ukrainian servicemen."
"This war is going on now for the happiness of living your normal life and just walking the streets of your city, that's what we are fighting for in it – address by the President of Ukraine",2022-05-29T20:58:00Z,"Strong people of our indomitable country! All our defenders! This address of mine is dedicated to four cities of Ukraine: Kharkiv, Kyiv, Severodonetsk and Kryvyi Rih. And through them - to our whole state, to all our cities and communities. Today I visited Kharkiv. Both the city itself and the frontline positions of our military in the region. Kharkiv suffered terrible blows from the occupiers. Black, burnt-out, half-ruined apartment buildings face east and north with their windows - from where Russian artillery was firing. From where Russian combat aircraft arrived. They face Russia. And in them now, like in a mirror, the Russian state can see itself. See how much it lost during these 95 days of full-scale war against Ukraine. Russia has already lost not only the battle for Kharkiv, not only the battle for Kyiv and the north of our country. It lost its own future and any cultural ties to the free world. They all burned down. In particular, there, in Saltivka. I held a meeting with the leadership of the region and the city. Thanked them for being and remaining together with the people of Kharkiv, together with Ukraine. And - what is very important now - together with each other. They have one hundred percent cooperation - the army, the police, the mayor of Kharkiv, the regional state administration - everyone really works for victory and does it very effectively. Unfortunately, this cannot be said about the local leadership of the Security Service of Ukraine. I arrived. Clarified the situation. Dismissed the head of the Security Service of the region. For not working to defend the city from the first days of a full-scale war, but thinking only of himself personally. What were the motives? Law enforcement officers will find out. One third of the Kharkiv region is still under occupation. We will definitely liberate the entire territory. And everyone should work for this result in positions both at the local level and at the state level. Before the trip, I signed a decree awarding our defenders. 222 combatants were awarded state awards. And during the trip today I had the honor to personally present some of the awards from this decree and others that were signed earlier. The post-war reconstruction of Kharkiv and the Kharkiv region was discussed very objectively with the local authorities. We must use only advanced ideas, only modern technologies in reconstruction. In particular, security technologies. And the best offers from our partners. Kharkiv and all other cities and communities in our country affected by the war must be reconstructed to have the most modern look in Europe. Returning from the east to Kyiv at this time leaves a rather ambiguous impression. After Saltivka's silence, there is Khreshchatyk, full of people and smiles. After the roar of artillery on the frontline - the relaxation of Kyiv residents who today walked the city. On the City Day, the Day of Kyiv, which is celebrated by thousands of people every year. But it is for such happiness to live, live your normal life and just quietly walk the streets of your own city that this war is going on now. That's what we are fighting for in it. For everyone in Ukraine. Freedom and peace is what could really be felt in Kyiv today. Even in spite of the air-raid siren that sounded today as well. So, I wish you, the people of Kyiv, to keep this peace - the peace of life. Take care of your city. And be sure to remember what it cost to defend the capital. Remember how many lives were given for the capital. I understand that in your eyes - it's summer already. I understand all this. But I want you to have an understanding - we still have to fight. The war is not over yet. Sophia and Lavra, Andriivskyi, Podil, Volodymyrska, Reytarska, Lypky and Khreshchatyk... I am grateful to everyone who made sure that the occupiers would never have a place here in Kyiv again. And I am very much looking forward to the day when I will be able to say similar words to another of our cities. A city that should celebrate its Day today in the same way as Kyiv. But... Russia came too close to it. It gathered too many forces in our Donbas. It was too prepared for the offensive there. I consider it very symbolic that the Russian military began the attempt to capture Severodonetsk by entering a hotel called “Myr” (Peace - ed.). Peace is indeed Russia's first target. Having taken away our peace in 2014, the occupiers want to take away everything else. Literally everything. They want to leave us neither freedom, nor houses, nor life. As a result of the Russian strikes at Severodonetsk, the entire critical infrastructure of the city has already been destroyed. 90% of houses are damaged. More than two-thirds of the city's housing stock has been completely destroyed. There is no mobile connection. Constant shelling. Capturing Severodonetsk is a fundamental task for the occupying contingent. And they don't care how many lives they will have to pay for this attempt to raise the Russian flag on 32 Druzhby Narodiv boulevard (Friendship of Nations - ed.) - no matter how bitter the name sounds now - where the Severodonetsk administration is located. We are doing everything to repel this offensive. There was not a day that we did not try to find more weapons, more modern weapons to defend our land, to defend our people. And I am grateful to everyone who defends Severodonetsk and demonstrates to the occupiers that peace will still be ours. In all our state, in all Donbas and of course - in Severodonetsk. And another city I want to address today. For me, of course, the city is special. My native Kryvyi (Kryvyi Rih - ed.) also celebrates its birthday today. Already 247th. It would celebrate. But the time is not appropriate. The conditions are not appropriate. And the enemy is still on our land. The time to celebrate will be after our victory. And it will come. And today I want to wish just that - to my hometown and to all cities and communities of our great country. A shorter time to victory. We must all work for this - each and every one without exception. In my inaugural speech three years ago, I said that each of us is a president. And right now it is felt the most. Because our future depends not only on my actions in this office, the office of the President of Ukraine, or on what is being done in other offices in Kyiv. But also on what is being done in Kharkiv, Sumy, Kryvyi Rih and Odesa, Lviv and Uzhhorod, Lutsk and Vinnytsia, Mykolaiv and Dnipro, Zhytomyr and Chernihiv, Poltava and Kropyvnytskyi, Chernivtsi, Frankivsk, Ternopil, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi and Cherkasy. Of course, in Kherson, in the Zaporizhzhia region, and in all territories of our Donbas and Crimea. The unity I saw with my own eyes today in Kharkiv. The heroism our soldiers in Donbas show every day. The determination of Kryvyi Rih. This is our path. The path to ensure that the peace of life is always felt throughout Ukraine and that smiles always reign, not the roar of artillery. Eternal glory to all who defend our state! Eternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
President held a meeting on the current situation in the Kharkiv region and the recovery of the region from the effects of the war,2022-05-29T15:03:00Z,"A working meeting on the situation in the Kharkiv region and Kharkiv was chaired by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Head of State heard reports from Head of the Kharkiv Regional Military Administration Oleg Synegubov, Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov, the military command and the leadership of law enforcement agencies in the region. The Head of the Kharkiv RMA informed the President that currently 31% of the region's territory is temporarily occupied, 5% has been liberated from Russian invaders. ""We are not yet able to fully inspect some of the liberated settlements, conduct full-fledged demining and begin rebuilding critical infrastructure, as shelling continues. Where we can do it remotely - we do it,"" said Oleg Synegubov. According to him, the actions of the Russian army led to the destruction of 2,229 high-rise buildings, of which 225 were completely destroyed. In Kharkiv, the northern and eastern districts of the city suffered the most damage and destruction - 30.2% of the total housing stock. During the working trip, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among other things, inspected the destroyed residential buildings in the Saltivka district of Kharkiv. During the meeting, the President proposed to analyze the feasibility of restoring damaged panel buildings, in particular, taking into account the program of thermal modernization of housing. ""If this is already the case with the war, then it is worth considering the possibility of removing panel buildings across the country, especially in the destroyed areas,"" he said. According to the Head of State, this is also an opportunity to modernize the country and cities, to build modern housing. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that new houses must be built with bomb shelters. ""We have to find funds, credit lines. The state must ensure this in terms of guarantees, and the leaders of cities and regions must find great projects and money,"" said the President. In addition, during the trip, Volodymyr Zelenskyy inspected the administrative buildings of Kharkiv, which were destroyed by Russian missiles."
President of Ukraine visited the frontline positions in the east of the country and presented state awards to the military,2022-05-29T14:51:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the frontline positions of the Ukrainian military during a working trip to the Kharkiv region. The Head of State got himself acquainted with the operational situation in the area of responsibility of the relevant units. Volodymyr Zelenskyy presented state awards and valuable gifts to the servicemen, and talked with the defenders of Ukraine. ""I want to thank each of you for your service. You risk your life for all of us and our state. Thank you for defending Ukraine's independence. Take care of yourself!"" the President said."
Terror has become in fact the only form of Russian action against both Ukraine and Europe - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's address,2022-05-28T21:59:00Z,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! The 94th day of the full-scale war is over. The situation is very complicated. Especially in those areas in Donbas and the Kharkiv region, where the Russian army is trying to squeeze at least some result for themselves. The key areas of struggle at the front are still Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Bakhmut, Popasna and other cities where the Russian offensive is concentrated. But our defense holds on. It's indescribably difficult there. And I am grateful to all those who withstand this onslaught of the occupiers. We work every day to strengthen our defense. This is primarily a supply of weapons. Every day we are bringing closer the time when our army will surpass the occupiers technologically and by firepower.  Of course, a lot depends on the partners. On their readiness to provide Ukraine with everything necessary to defend freedom. And I expect good news on this already next week. Today, the Russian army has launched absolutely senseless, openly barbaric strikes at the Sumy region. Missiles, mortars. And for what? And what does it give? Ukrainians of the Sumy region, as well as any other region of our state, have already understood everything about Russia. And it will not be able to add anything by the new terror. And even more so, it will not be able to intimidate. As a result of the Russian shelling of Mykolaiv today one person died, seven were wounded, two - in a grave condition. The shells hit a residential area, twenty meters from the kindergarten. These are the enemies chosen by the Russian Federation. Again and again I will remind the world that Russia must finally be officially recognized as a terrorist state, a state - sponsor of terrorism. This is simply true. This is fair and reflects the daily reality that the occupiers have created in Ukraine and are eager to bring further to Europe. And this must be legally enshrined. I am preparing for the meeting of the European Council, which will take place on May 30-31. I will address the participants of the meeting. In particular, I will talk about it. About terror, which has become in fact the only form of action of the Russian state in relation to Europe. Terror on the land of Ukraine. Terror in the energy market of Europe, not just our country. Terror in the food market, on a global scale. And what terror will be next? Only together - all Europeans - will we be able to stop such a policy of such a state. Of course, in my address to the European Council I will pay due attention to the progress in the development of our state, which has already been achieved and which can be achieved in the near future. I will also continue to address the parliaments of European countries next week. There will be many other international activities aimed at strengthening our state and increasing the joint pressure of the whole free world on Russia. I spoke today with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. On defensive support and fuel supply to Ukraine. On how we can unblock Ukrainian ports, and therefore prevent the food crisis from unfolding. Security guarantees for Ukraine were also discussed separately, and we need to intensify work on them. There is more and more information that the occupiers are trying to limit the departure of our people from the temporarily occupied areas of the Kherson region. They do not provide any humanitarian corridors. And they have closed the individual departure of people. Those who are confident in their position would definitely not make such decisions. This is clearly a sign of weakness. Manifestation that they have nothing to give people. And people do not want to take anything from them. So they try to take people hostage. But Ukraine will return everything that belongs to it. Everything. Definitely. And it's only a matter of time. And every day this time, the time of liberation, is reduced. We do everything for this. Eternal gratitude and glory to all who defend our state! Eternal memory to everyone whose lives were taken by the occupiers. Glory to Ukraine!"
"If the occupiers think that Lyman or Severodonetsk will be theirs, they are wrong; Donbas will be Ukrainian - address by the President of Ukraine",2022-05-27T23:44:00Z,"Unbreakable people of our bravest country! All our defenders! Today I want to begin this address with words of gratitude to all emergency care workers. Today is their professional holiday. These are people who are really indomitable, really brave, really committed to a good cause. It is impossible to even count how many lives were saved by emergency care workers. No matter what the conditions are, no matter what the time is, they always do their job. I am grateful to everyone for a really quick help and really dedicated work. Grateful for the work during the pandemic. I am grateful that now, during a full-scale war, people have access to the ""ambulance"" in areas of hostilities. I am grateful for the real heroism, which is shown everywhere - by both paramedics and drivers. Unfortunately, this war also took the lives of those who did everything to save others. Eternal memory to them! Today, the representatives of our state - the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health - presented awards to emergency care workers. And this is the minimum that the state can do to honor what they are doing. But there will definitely be a maximum. Before this war, until February 24, we did everything to raise the salaries of the emergency care employees to a decent level. And we will definitely continue this policy when we achieve peace for our country. I held a meeting with the Cabinet of Ministers today. Heard the reports on a wide range of issues. I expect greater activity from government officials. In particular, to overcome the shortage of fuel caused by Russian strikes at the refinery in Kremenchuk and oil depots in different regions of the country. And to provide jobs for our people. And on other important economic issues. I continue to gather the broadest possible international support for our struggle. Today I addressed the political and expert communities of Indonesia. We talked about the threats that Russia has created for every country in the world now. The food crisis alone means a lot. Due to the Russian blockade of our ports, there is a shortage of food in the market. Consequently, price increases are being provoked. Consequently, political chaos is being provoked in those countries that are most dependent on our exports. I am grateful to the Indonesians for understanding the arguments of our country and for their support in countering crises Russia is provoking. I talked to Stanford University students today. It is one of the world's leading universities. It was nice to see Ukrainian students studying there. It was also gratifying to hear how sincerely and fully the American student community is aware that we in Ukraine are fighting for our common freedom - one for all in the world. I invited Stanford students to join the implementation of the project of reconstruction of Ukraine after graduation. Because this will really be the biggest project of protecting freedom for their generation. I spoke today with Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi on how to prevent further development of the food crisis. And on the supply of fuel to Ukraine - this topic is a must in all my contacts with European partners. And on the defensive support for our state. Of course, the situation on the battlefield was discussed in detail. Difficult situation in Donbas. As expected, the situation is very difficult. The occupiers are trying to achieve in at least a hundred days of war the goals they hoped to achieve in the first days after February 24. Therefore, they concentrated maximum artillery, maximum reserves in Donbas. There are missile strikes and aircraft attacks - everything. We are protecting our land in the way that our current defense resources allow. We are doing everything to increase them. And we will increase them. If the occupiers think that Lyman or Severodonetsk will be theirs, they are wrong. Donbas will be Ukrainian. Because this is us, this is our essence. And even if Russia brings destruction and suffering everywhere there, we will still rebuild every city and every community. And there is and will be no alternative to our Ukrainian flags there. As always, I signed a decree today to award our military. 198 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 4 of them posthumously. As well as 27 servicemen of the Main Intelligence Directorate. Eternal glory to all who fight for our independence! Eternal memory to everyone who gave their lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
"Ukraine does not need to strengthen the powers of the authorities, but it is necessary to create a strict security system - President",2022-05-27T23:06:00Z,"Ukrainian society will not accept the strengthening of the powers of government institutions, but the state needs to build a strict security system. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during an online conversation with the Stanford University community. The Head of State stressed that today Ukraine is fighting for the values of freedom and democracy, so there can be no question of strengthening the powers of the authorities. ""If we defend it, how can I have a different opinion? Our people simply will not understand me. No, definitely no. But at the same time, we must seriously talk about a strict, built-up vertical for the security of our state,"" he said, answering students' questions. The President noted that the current security situation in Ukraine remains difficult, so it is necessary to pay special attention to the institutions that protect our state. ""As for the specific vertical, the specific institutions that work to protect people - everything here must be very serious. There can be no liberal things here. And in everything else our state is liberal, our people are liberal. You can see how our people are fighting for their freedom,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed."
"Volodymyr Zelenskyy: Sanctions are the right weapon against the aggressor, which does not take people's lives",2022-05-27T22:59:00Z,"The effectiveness of sanctions against the Russian Federation, which are already in force and under discussion, requires a single strong position of the whole world, which would make it impossible to circumvent these restrictions. This was emphasized by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during an online conversation with the Stanford University community. The President reminded that the leading international experts, members of the Yermak-McFaul group, are developing proposals on sanctions and submitting them to the world's leading states. Also, these experts analyze the effectiveness of certain restrictions applied against Russia. ""Today, unfortunately, Russia mostly circumvents sanctions. Why? Because there is no single strong position of the whole world against the aggression of the Russian Federation,"" the President stressed. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that the people of many countries of the world support Ukraine today, they understand whose side is the truth, who is to blame for this war, who is taking the lives and who is defending themselves. This encourages the leaders of these states to impose sanctions against the aggressor, because they are afraid of political pressure from societies. ""But secretly, they are helping Russia circumvent many sanctions. Therefore, we do not see that the sanctions put too much pressure on the Russian Federation,"" the President said. He stressed that sanctions are the world's right weapon against Russia, which is now taking the lives of Ukrainians. ""Sanctions are the weapon, which does not take people's lives. It simply shows that international law, human rights, sovereignty cannot be violated, that one cannot take someone else's property, moreover take people's lives. That is why such tools are needed,"" the President summed up."
"Ukrainians and Americans have become much closer: we equally understand the word ""freedom"" - address by the President of Ukraine to the Stanford University community",2022-05-27T22:53:00Z,"Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear friends! It is truly an honor to address your community for a second time - the Stanford University community - students, lecturers, all American men and women who care about Ukraine and empathize with our struggle for freedom. I am grateful to you for your interest and for such a number of sincere and caring bright eyes that I see now, see today. I see people in front of me, people who are not in bulletproof vests, who are not in helmets and who are not in bomb shelters. There are no wounded by enemy shelling among you. I am very glad. Glad for you. And this meeting of ours cannot be interrupted by an air alarm signal, because California is not threatened by Russian missiles. But, unfortunately, this is not the case in Ukraine. A lot has changed since last September, when I first visited Stanford during a visit to the United States. But on the other hand - much remains the same. As I said then, Ukraine is a country where anything is possible. And so it was. But now the whole world knows that even what others have been afraid to think about for many years is possible in Ukraine. Ukraine is a country that has destroyed the myth of the extraordinary power of the Russian army. An army that allegedly could conquer anyone it wants in a few days. But Ukraine is a country where the Russian army continues to wage a war it does not want to end. Now Russia is trying to occupy the whole country. But we feel strong enough to think about the future of Ukraine, which is and will be open to the world. Between September last year and May this year, our society has endured so much that I would not wish on any other nation. And we still have a new path to go from May this year to, say, the new September. I know that this path will be very difficult. Very painful. It will be a path on which young people won't look at university professors or their friends from a peaceful life, as you do. But at their comrades in the trenches. And at the enemies who can be seen in sight or on video from reconnaissance drones. But I also know that for Ukraine on this path there will definitely be a stage where peace will begin. Now I use words that each and every one of you read and hear very often in the media, in books. ""Struggle for freedom"", ""myth"", ""Russian army"", ""war"", ""survived"", ""trenches"", ""path"", ""peace"". Each of these words seems to be immediately clear. But do you feel all their depth now? Yesterday, Russian troops again shelled the largest city in the east of our country - Kharkiv. Using MLRS and special artillery called ""Pion"". This is heavy artillery - long range and powerful. It was with these weapons that the Russian army fired at ordinary residential areas of Kharkiv yesterday. Just houses. There was no military object there. As a result of this and other shellings, 9 people were killed in Kharkiv yesterday. Peaceful inhabitants. A family with a small child, 5 months old, was also shelled. The father died. The child died. The mother is badly wounded. We have been receiving such or similar messages for 93 days since February 24 and for 8 years since 2014. That's how it is in Ukraine. Everyone who studies at Stanford is equally familiar with the question: what matters most to you and why? To study at your university, you need to write an essay in response to this question. And I'm sure a lot of brilliant essays have been written over the years at Stanford. And I am sure that in the last 8 years there have been many brilliant students at your university. Apparently, among them were those who survived the war. And their answers to this question - what matters most to you and why - probably differed significantly from the answers of those who were lucky enough to live in peace. And now I'm not talking about the quality of the text. I'm talking about the depth of the sense of words by a particular person. After the start of the full-scale war, we are holding a special award ceremony in Ukraine for our defenders. Those who excelled the most. And who was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. As a special tribute, I present the Order of the Golden Star to the Heroes of Ukraine in the hall of the presidential residence where the highest officials of foreign countries visiting Ukraine - presidents and heads of government - were usually met. Or I give the Order to the Hero's relatives, if this title is awarded posthumously. One of our pilots was recently awarded. Combat aviation pilot. One of the best. He died in the battles for Ukraine. When I gave his Golden Star to his wife, I expressed my condolences. Condolences that he passed away. And tears appeared in her eyes. She replied that he had not passed away. That he had been in the sky for 30 years. And now he remained in the sky. And tears appeared in my eyes. I felt that death did not conquer these people, this family. He remained in the sky. He is alive to her. And it will always be so in this family. And all these words: ""sky"", ""life"", ""death"", ""Hero"" - for him, for her, for me, for you - they are different. With their depth. Although these words sound the same to us. And this depth, this distance in the feelings, in fact, weighs a lot today. It explains, for example, why even on the 93rd day of the war we are forced to talk about increasing sanctions on Russia, which will be enough for this country to finally start looking for peace, at least thinking about it. It explains why it is sometimes so long and difficult for us to negotiate with our partners about the supply of exactly the weapons needed to liberate our land. Although they want to help. So for me, this question, on which you had to write an essay, feels different, a little different. Because, in fact, I have been answering this question for a very long time, more than 93 days, when I try to give my country everything it needs so that we can survive, defend our freedom and, in the end, win. What matters most to me and why? I do not know whether the current presidents of a state fighting for its freedom have ever answered this question. But here is my answer. Pragmatic. Weapons that will help overcome the technical and quantitative superiority of the Russian army. Sanctions that will stop the flow of money for Russian terror. Finances that will allow Ukraine to maintain social normalcy while the war continues. Blockade and confiscation of all Russian assets in foreign jurisdictions that should be used to rebuild everything that this Russian army has destroyed. A fair tribunal against all war criminals who killed, tortured, raped and deported our citizens. Updated efficient security architecture that will prevent such new wars in the world. And, of course, a complete restoration of normal peaceful life in our country. So that our people, our students, like you now, can communicate freely and in complete safety with the presidents of democratic states. So that Ukrainians, like you now, won’t need to think where the bomb shelter is. And so that they will not need to know what the air alarm sounds like at all. And I am grateful to all our friends in the world who make these words - and their depth - sound the same for everyone on whom decisions to help Ukraine depend. Many Ukrainians have recently learned about one of our boys. A child from Mariupol, a city that was completely destroyed by Russian shelling. This little boy in the evacuation was very grateful to all those who sheltered his family and other residents of Mariupol. He really wanted to thank those who helped. He invited everyone to pay a visit to him. He said - come to us next summer, to Mariupol. And he says: yes, there is no more city... but the sea is left! And this story is about life. Which is sure to win. And which matters most, in fact, for each and every one. And this story is about a man who remains sincere and grateful even in the most terrible circumstances, because he is a free man. And I believe that Ukrainians, having survived this war, will remain just that. Sincere, grateful and free. And I'm sure that after this war, something will change in the relationship between you - the American people - and us. It is already changing. We became much closer in our feelings. We know for sure that we mean the same thing when we say the word ""freedom."" When I returned to Ukraine last September, I was very encouraged. I thought about how much we could do together. But now I feel a similar uplift. Because I see your eyes and I believe that many of you will be in Ukraine and will help our reconstruction after the war, because this is the biggest project on the protection of freedom, in which your generation can take part. Our cities are destroyed. Our sea is still blocked. But we remain free. And finally. On February 24, a full-scale war against Ukraine began, when 18-year-old Russian guys, military men, entered our country and entered the homes of our people. To kill, torture, rape. It is difficult to understand - for what? Difficult. And exactly three months later, on May 24, on the other side of the globe, in Texas, an 18-year-old guy entered a regular school to kill 19 children and 2 adults. It is impossible to understand at all. This is a tragedy. And we live in a terrible time when Americans express condolences to Ukrainians over the deaths in war. And Ukrainians express condolences to Americans over the deaths in peace. Please accept my condolences. Every day you should not just ask yourself another question, but be sure to find the answer: who matters most and why? This is the main question for me: who matters most and why? Take care of yourself, your family, loved ones, friends. Take care of the world. Thank you, America! Glory to Ukraine!"
President held a meeting with members of the Government of Ukraine,2022-05-27T19:09:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a working meeting with members of the Cabinet of Ministers on topical issues of the executive branch. The meeting was also attended by the Deputy Heads of the Office of the President. Among the most pressing issues discussed were the situation with the supply of fuel to Ukraine, price control and availability of fuel at gas stations amid growing consumption, economic recovery and preparation of farmers for the harvest campaign. Officials reported to the President on steps being taken to meet fuel demand and accumulate reserves. In addition, Volodymyr Zelenskyy was informed about what has been done and what is planned to be done regarding the accounting of destroyed property in order to attract donor funds and confiscated assets of the Russian Federation. He was also informed about the data on frozen Russian funds all over the world. Particular attention was paid to the preparation of a program for the return of temporarily displaced citizens to Ukraine, in particular the creation of jobs for them. It was stressed that the state must return its citizens immediately. The parties also discussed the organization of the government's work regarding the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. Among the important issues of the President's meeting with government officials were the end of the school year, conducting an external independent evaluation and admission campaign, as well as prospects and proposals for organizing the educational process in the country starting from September 1."
"President: Thanks to journalists, we managed to unite Ukrainian society and the whole world",2022-05-27T17:10:00Z,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the entire journalistic community for objectively covering the events in Ukraine since the first days of the full-scale Russian invasion and for conveying truthful information to people around the world. The President made this statement during an online meeting at the Foreign Policy Community of Indonesia think tank. ""I want my voice to be heard by the world. Only thanks to journalists we managed to unite the world, and we united ourselves within our state,"" the President stated. According to him, in this struggle of Ukraine against Russian aggression, honest and truthful journalists are no less important than weapons. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that he was impressed by the fact that since the first days of the war, 6,000 media representatives from different countries have been constantly working in empty Kyiv. ""I have never seen such a thing: an empty city, civilians left, the military fought and there were journalists everywhere. They have done a great job,"" he said. At the same time, the Head of State stressed that the war is not over, in some areas an active stage of hostilities is underway, and somewhere everything is just beginning. Therefore, Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on journalists to continue working to cover events in Ukraine and bring truthful information to the world, as this brings the victory of our state closer. ""I want to ask you not to leave us, because you are bridges between Ukraine and other countries. This information saves our lives. This is something we can't live without. This is a great job, and I am thankful to the entire journalistic community. There are no orders here - just say what you see. Tell the truth, and I'm sure we will win. Because the truth will win anyway,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged. The President also expressed his condolences to the relatives and friends of the media representatives - journalists, cameramen, technicians who died during this war."
Olena Zelenska discussed safe return of children to school with the UNICEF Representative in Ukraine Murat Sahin,2022-05-27T16:33:00Z,"First Lady Olena Zelenska met with UNICEF Representative in Ukraine Murat Sahin. In particular, The parties discussed the opening of 50 ""Together"" centers in Ukrainian cities. These are UNICEF-initiated hubs for families with children - IDPs, where you can get medical, psychological and information assistance. The President's wife also spoke about humanitarian projects she takes care of during the war. Among other things, it is the evacuation of children with cancer and children from orphanages abroad, humanitarian aid to orphanages in Ukraine and residents of cities where hostilities are taking place, the launch of a program of psychological assistance to Ukrainian citizens, implemented with WHO support. ""After World War I, there was a whole lost generation. It is important for us not to lose any generation of Ukrainians. In World War II there was the term ""children of war"". We must help children so that they do not associate themselves with the war all their lives, so that they can happily outgrow it and grow up with a peaceful worldview,"" said the First Lady about the purpose of the psychological rehabilitation program. In addition, Olena Zelenska informed about a new humanitarian project - helping people who have lost limbs. ""The war has given our doctors a completely unusual task: hospitals receive adults and children who lose their limbs due to gunshot wounds, mines and explosions every day. They all need prosthetics and very long rehabilitation, and Ukraine simply has not faced so many such injuries. So when the question arose whether we could send such patients for treatment abroad, I offered my help to the team of the Ministry of Health,"" said Olena Zelenska. For his part, Murat Sahin stressed the need to return Ukrainian children to the safe school education process from the new school year. UNICEF is planning a national campaign to restore education and rebuild destroyed schools. The First Lady stressed that she was ready to join such a project: ""As a mother of a child studying at home, I am also interested in her return to school."" The President's wife said that together with the first ladies of other countries she takes care of organizing summer vacations for Ukrainian children abroad. ""My proposal is to send Ukrainian children to local recreation camps, where they could learn the language of the country that sheltered them, and at the same time communicate more with peers. During the school year, the children were busy with lessons. It is important that they do not feel abandoned in the summer. In addition, many of our mothers have already found jobs, so such camps will be a great help for them. If UNICEF already has experience in this area, perhaps developed programs for the summer holidays, we will be happy to join forces,"" she said."
G20 must demonstrate its clear position on Russian aggression - Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-05-27T16:19:00Z,"Partner countries are providing significant support to Ukraine in the fight against the Russian invasion, and the G20 must demonstrate its clear stance on the aggressor country's policy at the autumn summit. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during an online meeting at the Foreign Policy Community of Indonesia think tank. He noted that due to the war, Ukraine's state budget deficit is $ 5 billion a month. The United States and partner countries provide significant financial assistance to our country. ""Today our partners help us cover (budget deficit): the European Union, separately at the bilateral level - non-EU countries, the United States, Canada, Australia and many other partners. Also financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund. And this is a big job,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The Head of State added that funds have been set up in a number of countries to help IDPs from Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also said that he had accepted an invitation from Indonesian President Joko Widodo to take part in the G20 summit to be held in the autumn. He expressed confidence that only partner states, not occupiers, would be represented at the G20 summit. The President stressed that in order to end the war in Ukraine, all democratic forces in the world must unite their efforts to put pressure on Russia. ""The ongoing war in the center of Europe must end. And this is where the unification of all forces is needed. It is a unification of more than just weapons - all politicians, diplomacy and the world's major economies. In order not to support the Russian Federation, its business, not to support trade with it, any relations with it until they stop their aggressive policy,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The Head of State is convinced that the G20 should give a clear assessment of Russia's aggressive policy. I think the G20 should put an end to this. At least to express its clear position in support of Ukraine,"" the President summed up."
President of Ukraine: We must prevent a large-scale famine provoked by Russia,2022-05-27T16:06:00Z,"The sooner Russia unblocks Ukraine's seaports, the sooner the food crisis in the world will stop. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during an online meeting at the Foreign Policy Community of Indonesia think tank. “Russia has blocked access to our ports in the Black Sea and occupied our part of the Sea of Azov. As a result of this military blockade, most traditional Ukrainian trade routes have been closed. Currently, 22 million tons of grain in Ukraine are in storage facilities. We cannot direct them to the world market, where they are needed right now, at this time,” the Head of State noted. According to the President, it has already affected the prices for grain, and soon will affect the prices for other food products, which could rise catastrophically. The governments of food-exporting countries have to adopt decisions to suspend the export of certain agricultural products from their countries to somehow keep domestic prices from explosive growth and protect their own consumption. “According to the UN, this year the world's hunger will affect an additional 40-50 million people. I consider such an assessment conservative. Hunger does not come alone. It is always accompanied by political chaos, which further aggravates the situation, destroys social life and creates even more dangerous conditions for ordinary people,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. According to him, the growth of food prices is a harbinger of poverty for the poor and impoverishment for the middle class if we do not take measures to change the current situation. “Just imagine the political chaos this could end with in certain regions,” the Head of State added, According to him, Russia's blockade of Ukrainian ports is a kind of example for other potential aggressors who want to conquer neighbors or take away their territory. “If Russia manages to go unpunished with this in the war against Ukraine, other states will see that the naval blockade is a supposedly permissible instrument of pressure in the modern world. Consequently, none of the trade routes at sea and no country will be safe after that,” the President stressed. Answering the audience's questions, the Head of State said that many countries will run out of last year's harvest stockpiles in July, and a crisis similar to the one in Europe's energy sector last year may arise in the autumn. “The sooner this war can be ended, the better it will be for each nation. Not just for us. The sooner our ports are unblocked, the sooner the food crisis will stop, because we will be able to send our stocks and new crops to the world market,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. He expressed hope that, in particular, the G20 summit would find a way to stop the unfolding of both the food crisis and the war in general."
Russia's war against Ukraine affects global situation - address by the President of Ukraine to the Foreign Policy Community of Indonesia (FPCI),2022-05-27T15:18:00Z,"Ladies and Gentlemen. Thank you for the opportunity to contact you today and for the upcoming communication. I hope that this conversation will bring us closer to understanding how to prevent large-scale crises from unfolding in many parts of the world. And the world is now really on the verge of several crises. My country, Ukraine, is one of the largest and absolutely conscientious food exporters. Every year we export tens of millions of tons of grain and other agricultural products. Our producers provide a high place for Ukraine in the world's top exports of wheat, corn and vegetable oil. But for the fourth month in a row, Ukrainian exports have been blocked due to a full-scale war waged by Russia against our state on our territory. Russia has blocked access to our ports in the Black Sea and occupied our part of the Sea of Azov. As a result of this military blockade, most traditional Ukrainian trade routes have been closed. Currently, 22 million tons of grain in Ukraine are in storage facilities. We cannot direct them to the world market, where they are needed right now, at this time. It is already felt that prices for grain, and later for other food, could rise catastrophically. And the governments of food-exporting countries have to adopt decisions to suspend the export of certain agricultural products from their countries to somehow keep domestic prices from explosive growth and protect their own consumption. According to the UN, this year the world's hunger will affect an additional 40-50 million people. I consider such an assessment conservative. Hunger does not come alone. It is always accompanied by political chaos, which further aggravates the situation, destroys social life and creates even more dangerous conditions for ordinary people. Already in July - when last year's stockpiles will run out in many countries - it will become clear that the catastrophe is really approaching. Just look at the prices in stores now - their growth is a harbinger of what will surely affect people if nothing changes, if we can't change anything. It is a harbinger of poverty for the poor and impoverishment for the middle class. Just imagine the political chaos this could end with in certain regions. And I have cited only one aspect of how the war waged by Russia affects the whole world. And there are many such aspects, in addition to the threat of hunger and chaos. The very fact of Russia's naval blockade of Ukraine is no less destabilizing for coexistence in the world. This is not just an act of aggression by one state against another. This blockade of our ports is a kind of training for other potential aggressors who want to conquer neighbors or take away their territory. If Russia manages to go unpunished with this in the war against Ukraine, other states will see that the naval blockade is a supposedly permissible instrument of pressure in the modern world. Consequently, none of the trade routes at sea and no country will be safe after that. Let's take the third aspect - the nature of the war waged by the Russian state against us. Since February 24 this year, the Russian army has used 2,400 different missiles against Ukraine. The vast majority was aimed at civilian infrastructure. The enterprises, warehouses, in particular warehouses with food, apartment houses, railway infrastructure. By the way, this is also important in terms of food security. We want to prevent the food crisis from unfolding. We are working to shift our exports to new routes - as much as possible in wartime - and to supply grain to the world market by rail through European ports. Of course, this may be a smaller volume of exports than through the Black Sea. But Russia is also trying to thwart our efforts by destroying railway bridges, railway stations and logistics centers with missiles. Dozens of Ukrainian cities and hundreds of villages were destroyed by shelling by Russian aircraft and artillery. It's just ruins. Black, scorched, empty cities. In three months, Russian warplanes have appeared in our skies more than 3,000 times. And there are no objects that they would try not to bomb. More than 600 healthcare facilities were destroyed - hospitals, maternity hospitals, clinics and outpatient clinics. Almost two thousand educational facilities - universities, schools, and kindergartens. Dozens of religious sites - churches, mosques, and other meeting places of religious communities - were burned or damaged by Russian shelling in various regions of Ukraine. Only yesterday and only in one of our cities, in Kharkiv, 9 people died as a result of Russian artillery strikes. Among them - a 5-month-old child and her father. The explosion threw the child from her father's arms onto the roof of the house. She was not even found at first. The mother was seriously wounded. The Russian military fired at ordinary residential neighborhoods. And this is the daily reality of our country since February 24. But the Russian invasion of Ukraine began much earlier. Back in 2014, Russia captured our Crimean peninsula and started a war in Donbas - in two regions of our country. This war remained local for 8 years, until Moscow decided to go on the offensive against our entire state. What is the meaning of this war for Russia? They talk about it openly. The Russian leadership believes that Ukraine should be a colony of Russia. And the Ukrainians? If the nation does not want to submit, it is decided to destroy it. The occupiers are also deporting our people to Russia and settling them in various remote regions. The number of such deported Ukrainians is hundreds of thousands. And this is also one of the ways to conquer the people. In fact, it is shocking how frankly Russia is trying to bring back to world life the order of the old days, when colonizers and empires imposed their policies or their domination on other nations. The fourth aspect is the attitude of the Russian occupiers towards the people in the occupied territories. We have the experience of Crimea, which since 2014 has been under control of Russia as an occupier. And it has become one of the most dangerous places in Europe. For all those who value freedom, for the indigenous people of Crimea - the Crimean Tatars, and for Muslims on the peninsula. There is not a single week - I emphasize this: not a single week in 8 years - that there is no news of repressions or trials against those whom the occupiers are not satisfied with. As a result, you will not find a place in Europe other than the Russian-occupied Crimea, where Muslims and all others who simply want to live their free lives are being repressed with such impunity and massiveness. How can this be ignored? This is happening in front of the eyes of the whole world! And the fifth aspect is that there has long been no such risk of using weapons of mass destruction. Russian state propagandists are openly threatening nuclear weapons. World politicians are preparing for the possibility of Russia's use of so-called tactical nuclear weapons or chemical weapons, biological weapons. What does this mean for the world? First of all, it can lead to a change in the attitude of different states to weapons of mass destruction. If Russia indulges in nuclear blackmail with impunity, it may seem logical to various forces in the world to acquire nuclear weapons for themselves. To say that it is dangerous for the whole world is to say nothing. Ukraine has made the greatest contribution to nuclear disarmament by relinquishing its third largest nuclear arsenal. This happened in the 1990s. Now Russia, contrary to its documented commitment to guarantee Ukraine's security after our state's renunciation of its nuclear status, is waging a war of aggression and colonization against us. And at the same time threatens with nuclear weapons. Who can believe in the idea of nuclear disarmament after that? And how to reliably guarantee long-term security to those regions that choose non-nuclear status after that? Six months ago, it was impossible to imagine that such questions would arise. But now it is also one of the consequences of Russia's aggressive policy. Ladies and Gentlemen! I have given you only 5 aspects of how Russia's war against Ukraine affects the global situation. I'm sure you realize that there are many more such aspects. This is the largest war in Europe since World War II. And today no one can predict one hundred percent what negative aspects for the world will definitely not be caused by this war. The sooner this war can be ended, the better it will be for each nation. Not just for us. The sooner our ports are unblocked, the sooner the food crisis will stop, because we will be able to send our stocks and new crops to the world market. Which this year, by the way, will still be less, as Russian troops deliberately mined fields and destroyed agricultural machinery. I believe that Russia has deliberately made a bet on the food crisis. To increase the dependence of other countries on themselves and to make access to food another factor of pressure in global politics. The sooner our lands are liberated from the occupiers, the more secure, in fact, will be the protection of people all over the world. Protection from the aggressive desires of those who want to pursue colonial policies, as in the old days. If the world is truly united and honest about this Russian aggression against our sovereign state, the speed of ending this war will be measured in weeks. Weeks, not even months. I am grateful to the leader of your country, the President of Indonesia, for inviting me to the G20 summit in the autumn. I accepted this invitation. And I believe that by the summit in the autumn, the world will have solved all these big problems. We must prevent large-scale famine. We must stop mass killings and repression. We must permanently wean any countries in the world from nuclear blackmail and playing with the threat of chemical or biological weapons. And I believe that at this Summit there will be only friendly states, partner states, and there will be no occupiers. I ask all Indonesians to pray for peace in Ukraine, for the people of Ukraine and for the wisdom of the world to be enough to save humanity from existing threats. Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!"
"Pressure on Russia is a matter of saving lives, and every day of delay is new killed Ukrainians and new threats on the continent - address by the President of Ukraine",2022-05-26T23:51:00Z,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! Exactly eight years ago, on May 26, the Donetsk airport stopped working. There is still a message about this: ""Attention! From 7 am, Donetsk Airport will temporarily suspend flights. The resumption of the airport's functioning will be announced additionally."" On that day, apparently, no one foresaw how events in Donbas would develop over these years. And then - throughout Ukraine after a full-scale invasion. No one predicted for how long the word ""temporarily"" would be delayed in this announcement. But that day and any day later, and today, two things can be said with confidence. First. Ukraine will always be an independent state and will not be broken. The only question is what price our people will have to pay for their freedom, and Russia - for this senseless war against us. And second. The catastrophic developments could have been stopped if the world had treated the situation in Ukraine as its own. If the strong of the world had not played with Russia, but really pressed to end the war. Just look at the situation now. Look at the number of weeks the European Union has been trying to agree on a sixth package of sanctions against Russia. So far, it receives almost a billion euros a day from Europeans for energy supplies. Of course, I am grateful to our friends who are promoting new sanctions. But where did those who block the sixth package get so much power? Why are they still allowed to have so much power, including in intra-European procedures? Look at the number of weeks the world has not dared to block the Russian banking system - all banks without exception, to deprive the aggressor of the opportunity to finance not only the war against us, but also the policy of creating splits and crises around the world. Look at how long we have been struggling to provide Ukraine with all the weapons it needs to change the nature of hostilities and start moving faster and more confidently to the expulsion of the occupiers. All weapons, including MLRS. The systems that are really needed to stop this aggression. We are confident that thanks to our efforts we will still be heard. Starting from May 26, 2014, and even more so from February 24 this year until today, there have been many opportunities for those who really have the strength to do so to put an end to it and say: now Russia will really feel the full price for what it is doing against Ukraine, against European unity and against freedom as such. The current offensive of the occupiers in Donbas can make the region uninhabited. They want to burn Popasna, Bakhmut, Lyman, Lysychansk and Severodonetsk to ashes. Like Volnovakha, like Mariupol. In cities and communities closer to the Russian border, in Donetsk and Luhansk, they gather everyone they can to fill the place of those killed and wounded in the occupation contingent. All this, including the deportation of our people and the mass killings of civilians, is an obvious policy of genocide pursued by Russia. Today, the occupiers shelled Kharkiv again. At the moment, the list of the dead includes nine people. 19 wounded. All civilians. A child (five months) and a father were killed. The mother is in grave condition. Among the wounded in Kharkiv is also a nine-year-old girl. Missile strikes again in the Sumy region, in Donbas again. Significant intensification of the occupiers' artillery in the Zaporizhzhia region again. Again, their efforts to burrow into the ground in the south. Pressure on Russia is literally a matter of saving lives. And every day of delay, weakness, various disputes or proposals to ""appease"" the aggressor at the expense of the victim is new killed Ukrainians. And new threats to everyone on our continent. I addressed the Latvian parliament and people today. Expressed gratitude for the help Ukraine received, including the defensive one. And for the help which the Latvian state and the Latvian people provide now. If everyone in the world had the same determination to defend our common freedom as Latvia and other partners who do not hesitate, there would simply be no evil that the Russian state has done to Ukraine, Europe and the world. I spoke today with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. I informed him about the situation on the battlefield, about the intensification of the occupiers' activities. We discussed how we can adequately enhance Ukraine's ability to defend itself and repel these attacks. I signed a new decree on awarding our heroes. 180 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 28 of them posthumously. The total number of awarded servicemen as of today is over 16,000. Precisely - 16 thousand and 44. In 92 days. But it is clear that there are hundreds and hundreds of times more feats and victories of our defenders. I am grateful to everyone who holds the defense. Who helps the army and all our defenders. And finally. Usually these days in May we celebrate the last bell in schools and congratulate boys and girls on the beginning of a new stage in life. Frankly, a brighter stage than childhood. Because finally opportunities in life emerge. Adult opportunities. But childhood is still not over yet. This year there is no traditional school holiday in Ukraine. And this is understandable. Such a time. Such a situation. And not all schools in Ukraine finish the education process in May this year. And not all graduates are now in our country. But the constant thing is whatever the time and whatever the situation, we must not lose our opportunities. We have to fight. We have to develop. We have to defend our freedom and be able to use that freedom. So, we have to be educated and brave. Don't lose a single day in your life. Know what you live the day for. And be sure to believe in Ukraine. Because it is here that Ukrainians have the best chance of success. And especially - after our victory. Which we will definitely gain. And we will definitely remove the phrase ""temporarily occupied"" in relation to our land, which will be liberated forever. No matter how difficult it may be. Eternal glory to all who stood up for Ukraine! Eternal memory to everyone whose lives were taken by the occupiers. Glory to Ukraine!"
The only way to bring Ukrainian grain to international markets is to stop the war or at least all military actions in the Black Sea - Oleg Ustenko,2022-05-26T20:34:00Z,"Ukraine has enough stored grain to meet domestic and international demand until at least the end of 2022, perhaps into 2023, but for this, all military actions in the Black Sea must be stopped. This was stated by Oleg Ustenko, an economic adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in a comment to Newsweek. As the media notes, the blockade of Ukrainian seaports by Russian troops, doesn't allow Ukraine to sell the country's excess produce abroad. Before Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukraine exported more than 6 million tons of grain via the Black Sea each month. Ukraine now has moved its exports to railways and roads, but these do not have the capacity of seaports. In April, for example, only 617,000 tons of produce were exported by rail. The adviser to the President emphasizes that Russia planned the blockade of Ukrainian seaports from the very beginning of its aggression to create a food crisis in the world and put as much pressure as possible on the West.  “Russia wanted to weaponize food as well,"" Oleg Ustenko noted. ""They are playing different cards at one time on the same table: energy, food, plus they have their “military operation” on our land and they're destroying infrastructure, all our food storage,"" he explained. According to the President's adviser, Russia is currently firing at any ships that appear in the Black Sea. But if a ceasefire is declared in the region, Ukraine will react quickly and ships with grain will leave seaports. ""If the fighting stopped, we could do that almost immediately because we have access to the main ports,” Oleg Ustenko said. ""My view is that the only way to move this grain to supply international markets is to stop the war, or at least to stop all military actions in the Black Sea,"" he emphasized."
Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Saeima of Latvia,2022-05-26T16:22:00Z,"Dear Mrs. Speaker, Mrs. Ināra! First of all, thank you for such kind words, thank you for your arrival, thank you for this support. Dear Mr. Prime Minister! Dear deputies of the Saeima! Dear Latvian people! I am glad to have the opportunity to address you today and, above all, to thank you for all the help that Ukraine has received from the Republic of Latvia and from many ordinary citizens of Latvia. You perceive our struggle for freedom as your own struggle. And this is true - because right now in Ukraine the fate of all of us, all Europeans, is being decided. It is the strength of weapons in the war that Russia has launched against our country, against Ukraine, and at the same time against the freedom of all its neighbors, that determines what will dominate in Europe for decades to come. Either it will be justice for every nation we strive for with you, or Russia will manage to make the words ""occupation"", ""repression"", ""deportation"" main again for different nations. I am grateful to you for the determination you've stood up for justice with. As early as 6 pm on February 23, ""Stingers"" from Latvia arrived in Ukraine. The weapons we received from you, from the first hours of Russia's full-scale aggression, began to save the lives of our people. While many others hesitated, looking for excuses, you were among those who acted. And continue to help us to the maximum now. In the defense sphere, with the support for sanctions, humanitarian support and extremely warm attitude to our citizens who have found temporary shelter in Latvia. Ukraine will always remember your help. I am grateful to you for this, grateful for this help! So why did it happen that someone resolutely chooses the path of action and support, and someone does everything to really do nothing? Why can those who do not have great resources show great courage, and some quite powerful actors in global relations do not find in themselves a percentage of the power you have? Why can they tolerate criticism for cowardice, double standards and hypocrisy, even accusations of direct indulging in Russian aggression just to stay away and maintain contacts with Russia? There are various answers to these questions. Of course, often the answer is just money. There are those who are just looking for benefits and are able to think only about profits, interest and account statements. There are those who hope in vain that they will be able to pacify Russia if they remain silent and do not really fight aggression. But, in fact, these are not decisive factors. They are an add-on. The basis of everything is contempt for values. There are people - and many of them among the powerful of this world - who believe that not all nations matter. Who believe that a nation can simply be forgotten to try to keep peace. Even the temporary peace, even the illusory one. Even peace at the cost of tens of thousands killed, hundreds of thousands deported or millions deprived of their homeland. They are OK with that. Peace at the cost of the lives of others. But this should not be normal! In the past - and even in the very recent past - this disrespect for certain nations has led to terrible and insidious conspiracies and pacts that deprived statehood, destroyed borders and inflamed the appetite for war. Millions of people died because of it. The lives of generations have been poisoned. And it seemed that at least Europe and the Western world drew conclusions from their experience. But now we hear again that Russia should be given what it wants. That supposedly it is necessary to accept that some nations may be deprived of part of their foreign policy rights, because certain, as they say, ""historical force"" wants it. There are quite serious talks about drawing some dividing lines along the body of a sovereign state in order to allegedly ""appease"" the aggressor. And allegedly concessions, concessions and concessions again are needed - of course, at the expense of the state, which was attacked, so that the aggressor allegedly mercifully stops. And this is about Ukraine, which has been defending itself for the fourth month already in a full-scale war against the second strongest army in the world. And what will happen if Russia starts a war against states that have less internal potential for defense than Ukraine? Will the world help such states? Or will they be given up without any disputes at all? And it's not just some speculation - it's a reality. This is our reality. In Russia, they openly say that they will not stop in Ukraine. They need the Baltic states, Poland and other European countries. That is why we must restore full respect for the fundamental values on our continent. We must fight absolutely clearly and at all levels for the principle: every nation matters. The interests of any nation cannot be ignored, betrayed or exchanged for something in a relationship with those who want to make that nation dependent on themselves. When this principle is truly respected by all, in full, then European unity will work. And then Russia will stand no chance either in the war against Ukraine or in the war against any other European country. When Ukraine is told that we should not be given all the weapons we need to win, they actually mean that our nation is allegedly less important than other nations who have already been given or can use such weapons. When we are told that we have to give away part of our land because it is supposed to be a ""necessary compromise"", it means that our people are considered less worthy of having their interests taken into account. Moreover, when they ask us to wait “a little longer” in the European Union's reception room - years or decades - not agreeing to give us full membership, and some still doubt the candidate status for Ukraine, it only emphasizes that the principle of respect for every nation does not work. And it must work. Because if Russia starts a war, say, against any state, God forbid Latvia, all NATO members will have to decide whether to defend Latvia. If Russia provokes an emergency crisis on the borders or inside a country of the European Union, all EU members will have to decide whether to provide help. And what will they be able to decide if there is no respect for each nation? We must do our best to never see the obvious answer to the question asked this way. Ladies and Gentlemen! On March 1, at a meeting in Riga Castle, a decision was made to award me the Order of Viesturs of the first degree - the highest award of the Republic of Latvia. It is a great honor for me. But I perceive this as a distinction not of my personal activity, but of our common struggle. The struggle of the Ukrainian people for independence. The struggle of the Latvian people for freedom in Europe. The struggle of all Europeans, who truly respect our common values, for Europe to be truly strong and truly united. We need this unity to guarantee the security of both Ukraine and every other state that may be threatened by Russian aggression. We need the strength and unity of Europe for Russia to pay for this war - to pay the full price, in particular through sanctions and the confiscation of its assets. Having experienced these losses, it must learn that war creates the greatest problems for the aggressor first of all. It is necessary not only to finally agree on the sixth sanctions package against the Russian Federation, including the embargo on oil, oil blends and petroleum products. But also to prepare the seventh sanctions package - with even more powerful restrictions on Russia for terror against Ukraine. Just like Latvia, the whole of Europe must restrict Russia's energy weapons. Fully. And, of course, we need the full potential of Europe to bring to justice those who organized and are carrying out genocide against the people of Ukraine in a competent court. And I am grateful to your state, to your President, Mr. Levits, for initiatives that will help bring Russian war criminals to justice. Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear Latvian people! Our parents hoped that the war would not hit our generation. That you and I would not be threatened by what previous generations had to endure. Occupation, repression, deportation… We have everything we need to eliminate these threats. And I'm sure we'll do it. Together. And guided by our values. Paldies, Latvija! Glory to Ukraine!"
President of Ukraine held a meeting with the Prime Minister of Finland,2022-05-26T15:44:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a meeting with Prime Minister of Finland Sanna Marin, who is visiting Ukraine for the first time. The Head of State noted the importance of visits of foreign high-ranking officials to our country. ""These are very important direct signals of support, first of all for the Ukrainian people, our people, who see that they are not left alone with today's ordeals,"" he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the government and people of Finland for their support. In particular, for five packages of defense aid, sanctions against the Russian Federation, as well as for financial and humanitarian aid. The Head of State stressed the need to impose the next, sixth package of sanctions against Russia by the EU as soon as possible. The key elements of the development of the democratic community's sanctions policy against the aggressor were discussed separately. The President noted the importance of Finland’s support for Ukraine's future membership in the European Union and for the EU decisions to achieve this goal that are needed now already. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted the importance of Sanna Marin’s visit to Irpin and Bucha. ""It was extremely difficult to look at everything that Russia has done to these cities. Many people died. At the same time, the heroic spirit of the Ukrainian people, who are fighting for their freedom and for the whole of Europe, is admirable,” said the Prime Minister of Finland. Sanna Marin stressed that her country and people today understand Ukrainians very well, given their historical experience. The President of Ukraine also informed the Prime Minister of Finland about the started comprehensive work on planning the reconstruction of our state after the victory. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that the people of Ukraine count on the active participation of Finland in this process and invited them to take a Ukrainian region, city or industry under their patronage for post-war reconstruction."
Those who advise Ukraine to give away territory to Russia do not want to see ordinary Ukrainians living there - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-05-25T23:43:00Z,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! I started this day by talking to the participants of the Ukrainian Breakfast, which took place within the Davos Forum. I want to say something about why I take part in such events, and what others are saying, particularly in Davos this year. The world turned out not to be ready for Ukrainian bravery. For the bravery of all our people who are not inferior to Russia and continue to defend our state. Remember how it all began on February 24, when many in the world did not even believe that Ukraine would be able to withstand a full-scale war. Was that so? It was. And why was that so? Not because all these people who doubted were equally mistaken when assessing the potential of our state. But because many of them did not even begin to assess. Many of them simply did not want to take Ukraine into account. There was no such habit - to take Ukraine into account. Although they have a habit of taking Russia into account. Even when there are no objective reasons for this. It is convenient for them. And really habitual. Often very profitable. Calling certain Russian politicians ""Dostoevsky's heroes"", as if it serves as an excuse for them. Talking about the alleged historical sphere of influence of Russia. And about the alleged balance in relations in Europe, which is allegedly impossible without Russia. No matter what the Russian state does, there is always someone who says: let's take its interests into account. This year in Davos it was heard again. Despite thousands of Russian missiles hitting Ukraine. Despite tens of thousands of Ukrainians killed. Despite Bucha and Mariupol, etc. Despite the destroyed cities. And despite the ""filtration camps"" built by the Russian state, in which they kill, torture, rape and humiliate like on a conveyor belt. Russia has done all this in Europe. But still in Davos, for example, Mr. Kissinger emerges from the deep past and says that a piece of Ukraine should be given to Russia. So that there is no alienation of Russia from Europe. It seems that Mr. Kissinger's calendar is not 2022, but 1938, and he thought he was talking to an audience not in Davos, but in Munich of that time. By the way, in the real year 1938, when Mr. Kissinger's family was fleeing Nazi Germany, he was 15 years old, and he understood everything perfectly. And nobody heard from him then that it was necessary to adapt to the Nazis instead of fleeing them or fighting them. Symptomatic editorials began to appear in some Western media stating that Ukraine must allegedly accept so-called difficult compromises by giving up territory in exchange for peace. Perhaps The New York Times in 1938 also wrote something similar. But now, let me remind you, it is 2022. And behind all these geopolitical speculations of those who advise Ukraine to give away something to Russia, ""great geopoliticians"" are always unwilling to see ordinary people. Ordinary Ukrainians. Millions of those who actually live in the territory they propose to exchange for the illusion of peace. You must always see people. And remember that values are not just a word. That is why I pay such attention to international platforms, addresses to parliamentarians, to parliaments, to the people of other countries, to communication with the expert community, with journalists, with students. We must do everything possible for the world to get a permanent habit of taking Ukraine into account. So that the interests of Ukrainians are not overlapped by the interests of those who are in a hurry for another meeting with the dictator. That's why I always have a lot of international communication in my schedule. Yesterday and today - Davos. Tomorrow - the Parliament of Latvia. The day after tomorrow - Stanford and Indonesia. Then - just as actively. I spoke with Austrian Chancellor Nehammer. I informed him about the situation in Donbas and other areas of hostilities. Expressed gratitude for the support. We agreed that Austria would take our severely wounded servicemen for treatment. Cooperation in the European integration of Ukraine was discussed in detail. I also spoke with the President of Liberia today. The main topic of conversation was the counteraction to the food crisis provoked by the Russian Federation. Expressed gratitude for the support for our sovereignty and territorial integrity, in particular at the UN platform. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence and all those who defend the state are resisting the extremely fierce offensive of Russian troops in the east. In some areas, the enemy is substantially superior in terms of equipment, number of soldiers. The Russian authorities have made an illustrative decision - they have allowed to hire older people for contract service. That is, they no longer have enough young people, but the desire to fight still remains. It still takes time to discourage them from this. We still need the help of partners, especially weapons for Ukraine. Total help! No exceptions, no restrictions. Enough to win. That's what those who really value people are talking about. And I am grateful to everyone who spoke about it, including in Davos. Who talks about it in the media and in the capitals of leading countries. Despite pressure from all those stuck in the XX century, when the interests of nations were indeed often traded for attempts to appease the appetites of dictators. I signed a decree today on awarding our heroes. 144 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 17 of them posthumously. And, of course, I would like to congratulate the communications service employees on their professional day - the Day of the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine. This is one of the most sensitive areas in modern warfare. Our joint success directly depends on the quality of your work, dear communications service employees. The success of our entire state. By my decree, I conferred the military rank of brigadier general upon three colonels of the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection. I am grateful to everyone who defends the state! Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
Ihor Zhovkva discussed with Konrad Szymański Poland’s support for Ukraine during the war with Russia and on the path to EU membership,2022-05-25T16:32:00Z,"Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Ihor Zhovkva held video consultations with Minister for European Union Affairs of the Chancellery of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Poland Konrad Szymański. Ihor Zhovkva expressed deep gratitude to the leadership of Poland and the Polish people for the unprecedented comprehensive support of Ukraine, significant political and practical assistance given the full-scale invasion of Russia. The interlocutors exchanged views on the expected results of the forthcoming special meeting of the European Council on May 30-31, a cross-cutting issue of which will be Ukraine. Ihor Zhovkva and Konrad Szymański spoke in detail about Ukraine's prospects of obtaining candidate status for EU membership. ""We count on the unity of the European Union around the political decision to grant Ukraine the status of a candidate for EU membership at the next meeting of the European Council on June 23-24, 2022. This will be an important strategic decision to ensure the security of the European continent,"" said the Deputy Head of the Office of the President. Ihor Zhovkva reminded that, according to the European Union, Ukraine's progress in implementing the Association Agreement is 65%. Therefore, granting the status of a candidate for membership in the European Union will be a logical continuation of the progress of our state on this path. The parties agreed on the need to approve the sixth EU sanctions package as soon as possible, including an embargo on Russian oil imports, as well as the necessity of international efforts to unblock Ukrainian ports to ensure food security for more than 400 million people. Separately, Ihor Zhovkva and Konrad Szymański discussed the practical aspects of involving Ukraine's international partners, including Poland, in the reconstruction of our country, which should become a common success story."
Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Davos: Both Ukraine and Western countries need unity and self-confidence today,2022-05-25T15:24:00Z,"Today the war for Ukraine's independence and freedom continues, and the end of this war depends, in particular, on the willingness of Western countries to provide our country with the necessary defense and financial support. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during his participation in the video format in the Ukrainian Breakfast within the World Economic Forum in Davos. ""The victory we are striving for is the beginning of a peaceful, united Ukraine,"" the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on Western countries not to be afraid to oppose Russia in this hybrid war, as their citizens are not currently required to take part in hostilities. The President is convinced that after the hot, bloody phase of this war, a diplomatic process will begin, but the date when that happens will also depend on Russia's position. ""After the military part, in any case, there will be a peace process and there will be a negotiating table. The question is with whom Ukraine will negotiate, with which President of Russia. And it also depends on the willingness of the incumbent President of Russia,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Head of State stressed that the current President of Russia is not fully aware of the real picture of events in Ukraine and in the world. And only when the Russian leader understands the scale of the disaster caused by the war will there be grounds for diplomatic negotiations. ""There is one person - the President of the Russian Federation. When he is ready to realize the reality and understand that many innocent people are dying, he will understand the necessity to talk and end this war started by the Russian Federation, no one else,"" said the President of Ukraine. At the same time, with each day of the war, with each new war crime of Russian soldiers, the willingness to negotiate in Ukrainian society will decrease, said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ""When Ukraine says that it will fight until it regains all its territories, it means only one thing: that Ukraine will fight until it regains all its territories. This is about independence and sovereignty,"" the Head of State stressed. However, he stressed that the ongoing hot phase of the war could move to negotiations if Russia demonstrates its commitment to a diplomatic settlement. ""We can move to this stage when we understand that at least the Russian side shows a desire to move from the stage of bloody war to diplomacy,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. According to the President of Ukraine, such a step could be the withdrawal of Russian troops to the positions that existed before February 24, 2022. But so far, he sees no interest in negotiations on the part of the Russian Federation. ""The only positive thing, if we can call it that way, is that the parties have started talking about unblocking Azovstal and evacuating people from Mariupol,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy, noting that the UN, ICRC and other countries helped in this process. According to the President of Ukraine, the Russian side is simply delaying the process, as it has been the case for 8 years in the framework of the Minsk process. ""Therefore, we are against any artificial agreements, without real confirmation by a circle of partner countries that are ready to support and be guarantors of security for Ukraine. Without serious powerful partners, there is nothing to talk about,"" he said. According to the President, the unity of Ukrainian society has enabled our state to resist the invasion of the ""second army of the world"".
 Therefore, the Head of State stressed that both Ukraine and Western countries today need self-confidence and unity. In particular, in the supply of weapons to Ukraine and in the imposition of sanctions on Russia. ""Self-confidence that the West is many times stronger and larger than the Russian army. And the position is much fairer. And they need to know that Ukraine is part of their world. Then they will unite not just with Ukraine, but around the similar state that is equal to them,"" the President said."
The supply of weapons to Ukraine is the best investment in maintaining stability in the world - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-05-24T22:55:00Z,"Strong people of our bravest country! All our defenders! The third month of our defense is over. This is a long time. A term not foreseen by the world's leading intelligence agencies. This was not even assumed by our enemies. And this is what motivates the world to look at our land, Ukraine, in a completely different way. This is three months of war crimes of the Russian occupiers. Three months of their strikes, destruction, blockade. And three months of mass exploits of our people who are defending their own land, their own country. 15,227 Ukrainian men and women were awarded state awards. 12,550 of them are servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. 1801 warriors of the National Guard. 205 border guards. 182 police officers. 167 employees of the Security Service of Ukraine. 138 representatives of the State Emergency Service. 99 representatives of the Main Intelligence Directorate. 38 employees of the State Special Communications Service. And also - employees of the Department of State Protection, the Foreign Intelligence Service, NABU, SBI and the Judicial Protection Service, who also contributed to our defense. 155 Ukrainians were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine, 75 of them posthumously. 1016 settlements of Ukraine have already been de-occupied. And each of these figures is a story. A story of extraordinary courage and self-sacrifice. This is the heroic defense of Mariupol. These are stories of success in the battles for Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv. This is a heroic defense in Donbas. This is the defense of Odesa, Mykolaiv and our entire south. These are protests and resistance in those cities and communities of Ukraine that we have yet to liberate. We must always remember that we have survived these three months thanks to the tens of thousands of feats of all those who defend the state. And at the cost of tens of thousands of lives of Ukrainian men and women killed by the occupiers. Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Another completely inadequate statement was made from Russia today that they were allegedly ""slowing down"" the offensive on purpose. Well, after three months of searching for an explanation why they failed to break Ukraine in three days, they came up with nothing better than to claim that they had allegedly planned to do so. Almost 30,000 Russian soldiers killed. More than 200 downed aircraft. Thousands of lost Russian tanks, armored vehicles and other equipment. Russian missile ammunition is almost completely used up. And they want to cover it up with lies that they are not fighting at full strength? Miserably. And the time will come when they themselves will admit it. Now the situation in Donbas is extremely difficult. In fact, all the strength the Russian army still has was thrown there to attack. Lyman, Popasna, Severodonetsk, Slovyansk - the occupiers want to destroy everything there. But in the interceptions of their conversations, we hear that they are well aware that this war does not make sense for Russia and that strategically their army stands no chance. But it takes time and still a lot of extraordinary efforts by our people to break their advantage in the amount of equipment and weapons. I am grateful to all the partners of Ukraine who help. But I emphasize again and again: the longer this war lasts, the greater will be the price of protecting freedom not only for Ukraine, but also for the whole free world. Therefore, the supply of heavy weapons to Ukraine - MLRS, tanks, anti-ship and other weapons - is the best investment in maintaining stability in the world and preventing many severe crises that Russia is still planning or has already provoked. We continue to work to ensure that Ukraine receives reliable security guarantees after this war. In particular, an international advisory group headed by Yermak and former NATO Secretary General Rasmussen has been set up. The group will include leading experts in the fields of security and defense, diplomacy. Their task is to develop a format of guarantees that will really work. And not for several months or years, but during the lifetime of many generations of our Ukrainians. I spoke today with President of the European Council Charles Michel. At the end of May, an important meeting of the European Council will be held on assistance to Ukraine. So we coordinated our positions. In particular, on strengthening sanctions on Russia. I also spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. First of all, about the defense support for Ukraine. About further political cooperation and providing our state with all the assistance, including financial, which is so necessary to beat the occupiers. I held a meeting with the leaders of the Crimean direction of our policy. In particular, with Tamila Tasheva, Permanent Representative of the President of Ukraine to the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. The Russian invasion began in Crimea. This was not the first item on the list of mistakes of the Russian state towards Ukraine, but the first fateful one for Russia itself. It is from this point that the following, no less fateful mistakes of Russia came, which all together will lead to its historical weakening. And, of course, the occupiers will have to leave Crimea, too. As well as Kherson, Melitopol, Enerhodar, Mariupol and all other cities and communities where they still pretend to be the masters. They will definitely not be the masters there. I am grateful to each and everyone who helps bring this time of liberation of our territory and peace closer. I am grateful to all our military, intelligence officers, border guards, sappers, rescuers, doctors, nurses, police officers, National Guard, communications service employees, diplomats, volunteers, journalists, all transport workers, Ukrzaliznytsia, workers of the energy sector. To everyone who provides logistics. To everyone who organizes the evacuation. To everyone who restores life in the liberated territory. To everyone who continues to teach pupils, to teach students. To everyone who keeps business and, consequently, jobs for our citizens. To everyone who works, saves, helps and promotes Ukrainian interests in the world. I am grateful to everyone who decided to be with Ukraine on February 24. We will definitely win! Glory to Ukraine!"
Olena Zelenska spoke about the humanitarian situation in Ukraine in the framework of the World Economic Forum in Davos,2022-05-24T22:34:00Z,"First Lady Olena Zelenska spoke at the Ukrainian House in the framework of the World Economic Forum in Davos (Switzerland) and spoke about the humanitarian situation in Ukraine. The President's wife joined the conversation via video call from the Ukrainian House in Kyiv. The First Lady showed the participants photos of Ukrainian cities before and after the Russian attack, as well as photos of Ukrainians wounded by the Russian shelling. Olena Zelenska noted that today it is an image of the whole of Ukraine: wounded, the country seeks to live on and is fighting for it. ""When it became clear that the enemy was not just destroying civilian objects, but was doing so deliberately - we have more than 200 destroyed hospitals - we began to rescue the most vulnerable. We started taking children with oncology abroad. We take orphans abroad, and you can meet the children of two orphanages in Switzerland - they were hosted by the cantons of Bern and Vaud. Thank you for that,"" said the First Lady. ""We are rescuing and providing those who stayed in Ukraine with essentials. Incubators for perinatal centers... Today in Ukraine there are several dozen children with limb amputations who need prosthetics and long-term rehabilitation. This is the task I am now beginning to pursue. I will turn to the world's leading clinics. And our brand new project is the National Mental Health and Psychosocial Support Program,"" the President's wife added. Answering the audience's questions, Olena Zelenska commented on the role of Ukrainian women in wartime, calling their resilience outstanding. She also spoke about how to help and support Ukraine. First of all, according to the First Lady, one should not get used to war. ""We ask on behalf of the whole of Ukraine - do not to get used to the fact that somewhere in Europe children are bombed. Talk about it. Because as soon as we all get used to it, Putin will have a psychological victory. Second - verify the information. The information warfare is also ongoing. And if you start to think that there may be some justification for attacking another country, that invasion may make some sense, it means that you are under the influence of the Russian media,"" said the First Lady. Olena Zelenska added that in order to support our state, public representatives should influence their governments, calling on them to increase sanctions on Russia. ""The sooner it feels them, the less people will die in Ukraine. And representatives of big business, people who have financial authority in the world, can influence the situation by ceasing cooperation with Russian companies,"" the President's wife is convinced. The First Lady also told how she manages to hold on during the war: “We have a meme on this. When Russian troops attacked near Kyiv, they dropped bombs from aircraft on the small, cozy village of Borodyanka. And when our people returned, they noticed that there was a kitchen cabinet on the wall of the bombed-out high-rise building. An ordinary one, even with utensils cutlery. So now to the question ""how are you?"" we have the answer: like a kitchen cabinet from Borodyanka, holding on. That's how we all are today."""
Speech by Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak at the Securing Europe panel in the framework of the World Economic Forum in Davos,2022-05-24T20:58:00Z,"Dear panelists, dear guests. Thank you for the honor of opening this meeting. It's dedicated to one of the most pressing issues in today's world. The panel is focused on securing Europe. I am here as an official Ukraine's representative. No more doubts, obviously. Ukraine is Europe. Shame, it took eight years for Europeans to realize it. In those eight years the world order shattered, the political map was illegally changed, tens of thousands of people died and millions more had to escape. However, despite all the crimes Russian soldiers committed in Bucha, Mariupol, Chernihiv, and dozens of other locations, we keep hearing calls for capitulation for the sake of peace in Europe. Some of our partners are still suggesting us to give in to the aggressor to save lives. Negotiations on so-called territorial disputes are proposed. How can one believe it when Russia shows outright intention to destroy Ukraine? How can one hope for it while Russian opinion leaders are calling Ukrainians, us, the wrong Russians? How can one expect it, given the numerous testimonies of acts of genocide against Ukrainians committed by Russian troops? Ukraine does not have any territorial disputes with Russia. Russia has simply occupied and tried to annex Ukrainian territories. Illegally. Absolutely. More than anyone, we strive for a balanced and rational dialogue. However, Russia's political culture does not provide for a dialogue on equal terms. Its basis is dictation. The language of brute force. More than anyone in the world, we seek peace. But it should be just. Our sovereignty and territorial integrity are not subject to compromise. We are dealing with ideologies and practices terribly alike the worst dictatorships of the last century. History teaches us that pacifying an aggressor is futile. They always take peacefulness for weakness. They demand more with every next concession. Therefore, there is only one way to prevent the war in Ukraine from escalating into a continental and even world war: help Ukraine win. Now, you don't have to wage this war. Just help us do it. Otherwise, you'll have to. You'll have to send your troops to the battles. Helping Ukraine is a way to resolve the contradiction between values policy and realpolitik. This is a way to send a clear signal to potential aggressors: their actions will not go unpunished. So, Ukraine's immediate goal is to stop Russia's brutal aggression and ensure the complete withdrawal of its troops from our lands. Then, we must find a reliable way to deter Russia from repeating aggression in the future. But the world order is nearly wrecked and shattered. The UN is semi-paralyzed with Russia's presence in the Security Council. The OSCE has lost its raison d'etre. NATO is the only institution capable of providing a reliable security umbrella to its members. But some of the Allied nations still allow Russia to veto Ukraine's accession. So, we have to take an alternative path.  Today, I'm glad to announce here in Davos that together with the former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen we're establishing an international advisory working group. Its aim is to make some recommendations for reliable and efficient security guarantees for Ukraine. Leading figures from security, policy and diplomacy as well as scientists will be invited to join in and contribute. We look forward to involving the friends of Ukraine who can offer their expertise and experience to efficiently implement the initiative. Our goal is to stop history from repeating and prepare the future for a sovereign and free Ukraine.  Given the Budapest Memorandum experience, we assume that the future agreement should contain security guarantees, not assurances. This is very important. No third parties' security obligations can fully substitute for Ukraine developing and sustaining its own strong defense capabilities. So, the first block of security guarantees is related to enhancing Ukraine's ability to resist aggression. To ensure Ukraine's defense capabilities, the guarantor states should provide our Armed Forces with modern conventional weapons and military equipment. No restrictions nor politically motivated bars. We need weapons to defend. We must be able to withstand any aggression. Since February 24, nearly seven hundred Ukrainian children have been killed, tortured, raped, and wounded by the Russian troops. Those are we know of for sure. So, the toll is probably much higher. Over two hundred and thirty thousand kids were deported to Russia. We must be able to protect our children. They have the right to live in a safe country, and we are to ensure that right. As part of their commitment, partners could help us in the fields of intelligence sharing, information security, cyber security, maritime security. We believe that rapid recovery of defense potential of Ukraine is one of important factors in preventing the new possible aggression. Russia has badly damaged our economy. And we can't put enough money into defense in the coming years. So, we'll need annual financial aid. For reconstruction purposes as well as for financing the security and defense. The next block of security guarantees is sanctions. They are an effective tool for stopping Russian aggression today and deterring it in the future. The current sanctions should last at the very least until the complete withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. Their mitigation and lifting should be agreed with the Government of Ukraine. We should consider the risk of restoring Russia's military-technical potential. We also believe that guarantees of imposition of preventive sanctions should also be provided in case of a real threat to our state. And, of course, in the event of aggression immediate and coordinated sanctions should be provided. The final bloc of security guarantees is related to political and diplomatic support of Ukraine. Embedding Ukraine in multilateral diplomatic processes would improve our integration with the international community. First of all, it's about Ukraine's joining the European Union as soon as possible. I need to emphasize we don't think the so-called alternative formats of integration are acceptable here. Ukraine also supports the establishment of a coalition of responsible states like ""Friends of Ukraine"" or ""Anti-War Coalition U-24"", which will be ready to effectively respond to violations of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within 24 hours. This means providing the necessary military and military-technical, financial and humanitarian aid, as well as imposing sanctions against the aggressor country within 24 hours. When it comes to security guarantees for ourselves, we are not asking. We offer our partners to invest in common security. First, European. In the future, this system could become the basis of a new global security architecture. Thanks for your time."
Volodymyr Zelenskyy discussed with Tamila Tasheva the support for Ukrainian citizens in the occupied Crimea and the development of the Crimea Platform,2022-05-24T18:27:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy held the first meeting with the newly appointed Permanent Representative of the Head of State to the Autonomous Republic of Crimea Tamila Tasheva. The meeting was also attended by Deputy Permanent Representative of the President to the Autonomous Republic of Crimea Denys Chystikov, Head of the Crimea Platform Support Service Maria Tomak, First Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Emine Dzhaparova and Deputy Head of the Office of the President Ihor Zhovkva. Volodymyr Zelenskyy discussed with the participants the mood of Ukrainian citizens in the Russian-occupied Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, the prospects for the liberation of the peninsula and the issue of resistance to the occupation. ""It is important for us to understand the mood of the people in the occupied Crimea and Sevastopol. After all, we realize that active and caring citizens of Ukraine on the peninsula will be our mainstay during the liberation of Crimea from occupation. We must support them,"" the President stressed. According to him, in addition to the work aimed at increasing international political support for deoccupation, the first thing to think about is the adoption of additional laws and regulations that help ensure the rights of Ukrainian citizens in Crimea. Tamila Tasheva spoke about the activities of the President's Permanent Mission aimed at maintaining contact with Ukrainian citizens on the peninsula who are protesting against the war in one way or another and expressing their solidarity with the mainland of Ukraine. She mentioned some high-profile cases of persecution of activists. ""We have to keep in touch with these people. They should feel that we see and appreciate these signals of solidarity from the occupied territory,"" she said. In addition, the participants of the meeting discussed the prospects for the development of the initiative of the President of Ukraine ""Crimea Platform"". In particular, holding international events in August 2022, which will bring together participants of the inaugural summit of the Crimea Platform and potentially expand the geography of states that support the declaration of the Crimea Platform. Tamila Tasheva also handed over to Volodymyr Zelenskyy a letter from the Deputy Speaker of the Crimean Tatar People's Mejlis Nariman Dzhelialov who was arrested after participating in the inaugural summit of the Crimea Platform in 2021. Now the occupiers are holding him captive. In the letter, Nariman Dzhelialov, in particular, thanked the President of Ukraine for signing a law introducing social and legal protection for political prisoners, prisoners of war and civilian hostages."
Andriy Yermak and Anders Fogh Rasmussen will chair an international advisory group that will provide proposals on security guarantees for Ukraine,2022-05-24T18:01:00Z,"Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak has announced the establishment of an international advisory group that will develop proposals on security guarantees for Ukraine.

"Volodymyr Zelenskyy: I have always been confident in Ukrainians and our unity, because we all have common values and views of the most important things.",2022-05-24T12:32:00Z,"The unification of Ukrainians after the beginning of the Russian invasion proves that the citizens of Ukraine, despite some differences, have common values and views of important strategic issues. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during an online conversation at the Ukrainian House in Davos. ""It wasn't a surprise to me that our people are so united. Sometimes different parts of our country have different opinions, different views of some things, there are different people. Russian is spoken more in the east and Ukrainian is spoken more in the west. But we are so united, and I am happy that my confidence in the Ukrainian people has been confirmed. We are different, but the same. We are different in details and trifles, but we are the same in important strategic things, in human things. We have the same values,"" the Head of State stressed. The President also noted that he has always considered Ukraine the best country in the world. ""I am a fan of Ukraine, I have always been. Whenever I had the opportunity to choose where to have a vacation before the presidency, I chose one or another place in Ukraine. Even if the mountains are higher and better somewhere, for me in Ukraine they have always been the best,"" he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that he feels at home only in Ukraine, and defending our country is the same as defending your home from criminals who broke in at 4 am. The President expressed the opinion that after this war Ukrainians will look at their land, their nature and their country differently. According to him, the war gave an additional understanding that the most important things are very simple. ""When the children are around, everything is fine with your wife, parents and loved ones are alive. When neighbors are alive, nothing is burned, the missile did not destroy their property… Because grief is common. And this invasion of Russia is a common grief,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy explained. The Head of State is convinced that now the greatest happiness is probably the opportunity for Ukrainian families to gather together in the evening at home."
"Today, several thousand of our people are in captivity, we must exchange them - the President",2022-05-24T10:26:00Z,"The most pressing humanitarian issues for Ukraine today are the exchange of prisoners, the unblocking of Ukrainian ports and the export of grain, as well as the search for and establishment of the location of Ukrainians illegally deported by the aggressor country. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during an online conversation at the Ukrainian House in Davos. ""The first is the exchange of people. Today, this is a humanitarian moment and a political decision that depends on the support of many states. You know, several thousand of our people are in captivity after the blockade of Mariupol, Azovstal. Besides, there were people from Donbas. They are in captivity today. These are absolutely brave people, I am immensely grateful to them. They did a great job. Heroic, historical. We must exchange them,"" the Head of State stressed. According to him, Ukraine has involved the UN, Switzerland, Israel and many other countries that are trying to talk to Russia in the exchange process. However, according to the President, it is necessary not to persuade Russia, but to put pressure on it, demanding the necessary decision. ""In no case can you play with Russia. You should put pressure politically through business closures, oil embargo. Threats in terms of sanctions, business. And through these threats to achieve the possibility of exchange. To activate the exchange of our people for the Russian military,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The second humanitarian problem, according to the President, is the threat of global food crisis, as Ukrainian ports are blocked by Russia. ""There will be a shortage of food products due to the blockade of all ports in our country. Today, 22 million tons of grain are blocked by the Russian Federation, which completely controls the Black Sea and Azov coasts,"" he said. To prevent food shortages, the world's political and business elites must take measures to ensure that this grain is unblocked and exported to Europe, Asia and Africa, the President is convinced. ""So that people have something to eat. That's how some countries will face this question - that there is nothing to eat. And we have to help with that,"" he added. Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the illegal deportation of Ukrainian citizens to the territory of the Russian Federation the third important humanitarian problem for which there is no practical solution yet. ""About 500,000 people were forcibly deported to Russia or the occupied parts of Donbas. The children were taken away by force, separated from their parents. There are many such cases. We appealed to both the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations. Where they have access, they are looking for these people, we are looking for them,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. According to him, it is difficult to establish the location of illegally deported Ukrainians, as their passports, other documents and phones are often confiscated. ""Personally, I can't find a solution to this problem yet. I would like to draw the attention of the international community to this issue. And I would like to bring people home or at least get information about their whereabouts, about whether they are alive or not,"" the President said."
"President of Ukraine in Davos: There is no notion of distance for the occupation, the most important thing is to stop any aggressor from the very beginning",2022-05-24T09:59:00Z,"Today, Ukraine is fighting for freedom and independence, for the values of all mankind, so the countries of the free world must support our state so that their citizens do not have to face the horrors of war. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during an online conversation at the Ukrainian House in Davos. ""Our task is to ensure that the world doesn't get tired of war and keeps supporting Ukraine, because we are fighting for the values that people live by, the values they breathe like oxygen,"" the President said. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine expects support from the West, including the necessary defense and financial assistance, as well as strengthening sanctions against Russia. “There is no notion of distance for the occupation, the most important thing is to stop any aggressor from the very beginning,” the President said. ""Ukraine is the first. It is on the border with Russia, which is going on the offensive today. If we fall, if Ukraine does not endure - Russia will move on. And then it will go to the Baltic states - Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia. These are small states that, even if the three of them unite, will not be able to protect those values. And then the military of NATO member states will have to come here. And in order for the military of NATO countries, your families, not to see what we see, you need to help Ukraine,"" he explained. The Head of State noted that almost 100 Ukrainian servicemen die every day in battles with the Russian aggressor, but the Russian authorities do not care how many of their soldiers died in this war, and they do not even think about burying them. ""We have tens of thousands of black packages with people who are not taken away by Russia. These are their soldiers,"" the President of Ukraine said. He told how he presented orders to the families of servicemen who were posthumously awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. According to him, there wasn’t happiness from receiving the award, but the tragedy and tears brought by the war in the eyes of the relatives of the Heroes. ""But we have no choice, because we did not start a war. We are on our own land, we have nowhere to go. And that's why we are strong. And that's why we're united. That is why we are fighting for freedom. No one wants to lose their life, but people give their lives for the future. This banal phrase - they give their life for the sake of others - contains great pain, great suffering of the Ukrainian people and any people going through the war. That's how wars end. And it is impossible to assess this pain,"" the President is convinced. According to him, this is not a war to the last Ukrainian, but ""we simply do not have the right to give away the land and the people who live on this land."" ""Therefore, there will be a victory. Because this is our land, our people, we fight for them and pay a high price. There will definitely be a victory, because there is simply no other way out,” the Head of State is convinced. The President stressed that without the wars for independence there can be no freedom and independence, and this should be remembered by the citizens of other free democracies, whose ancestors also fought bravely for the independence of their states. ""We need weapons and sanctions, and we give you freedom and independence for that. It seems to me that this is fair,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy said."
"The coming weeks of the war will be difficult, yet we have no alternative but to fight and win - address by the President of Ukraine",2022-05-23T22:21:00Z,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! Every day, addressing our people, I emphasize how difficult and at what cost it is to defend against Russian aggression. The occupiers are waging a very brutal war against us. Indeed, there has been no such war on the European continent for 77 years. Total war. When the enemy tries to destroy as many people and infrastructure as possible. The clearance of debris in Desna in the Chernihiv region has been completed. 87 dead. And these were only four missiles. In total, since February 24, the Russian army has launched 1,474 missile strikes at Ukraine, using 2,275 different missiles. The vast majority was aimed at civilian objects. In less than three months, there have been more than 3,000 air strikes by Russian aircraft and helicopters. What other country has withstood such a scale of strikes? Every time we tell our partners that we need modern anti-missile weapons, modern combat aircraft, we are not just making a formal request. We say that our request is the real lives of many people who would not have died if we had received all the weapons we are asking for. By the way, today, talking to the participants of the Davos Forum, which began its work, I spoke in particular about this. About the need to provide Ukraine with everything it needs to save the lives of our people. All our partners agree that Ukraine's struggle in the war against Russia is the protection of the common values of all countries in the free world. Our common freedom. And if so, then we have the right to count on full and urgent assistance, especially weapons. My every international negotiations, every address to parliaments or other foreign audiences is necessarily related to this topic. And I am grateful to all those partners who help and provide us with the necessary weapons and ammunition to overcome the advantage of the Russian army, especially in the amount of equipment and weapons. The most difficult fighting situation today is in Donbas. Bakhmut, Popasna, Severodonetsk - in this direction the occupiers have concentrated the greatest activity so far. They organized a massacre there and are trying to destroy everything living there. Literally. Nobody destroyed Donbas as much as the Russian army does now. And I am grateful to all our warriors who are holding their positions and have the courage to counterattack. Today in Kyiv, at the Mariyinsky Palace in the White Hall of Heroes of Ukraine, I presented the Orders of the Golden Star. To the warriors, as well as to the relatives of those of our Heroes who were posthumously awarded. In particular, to the sister of sailor Vitaliy Skakun. He was a sapper of the 137th Separate Marine Battalion of the 35th Separate Marine Brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Ostrogradsky. He died performing a combat mission in southern Ukraine. Thanks to his courage and heroism, we managed to significantly delay the offensive of the overwhelming forces of the enemy and save hundreds of lives of our soldiers. In this war - both from February 24 and from 2014 - the Marines proved their extraordinary bravery. They were among those units that heroically defended Mariupol. They took part in many important battles.  And today - on the Day of the Marines - I express my sincere gratitude to all those who defend the state in these troops. The Russian occupiers are trying very hard to show that they allegedly will not give up the occupied areas of the Kharkiv region, the Kherson region, the occupied territory of the Zaporizhzhia region and Donbas. They are going on the offensive in some areas. Reserves are being accumulated in some areas. Somewhere they are trying to reinforce their positions. The coming weeks of the war will be difficult. And we must be aware of that. Yet we have no alternative but to fight. Fight and win. Free our land and our people. Because the occupiers want to take away from us not just something, but everything we have. Including the right to life for Ukrainians. However, to win, each and every one of us must work for it. And including those in the rear. Help the army. Protect the needs of our state in all international platforms to which you have access, in communication with foreign journalists, even just with your friends and acquaintances abroad. Every vote counts. Today, as every day, I worked to increase the pressure on Russia. Our representatives in Davos are working to give Ukraine more financial and humanitarian support. And for all diplomats of our state the absolute priority is weapons and ammunition for our state. In the evening I signed a decree on awarding our warriors. 161 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 42 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to everyone who gave lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all who are bringing our victory closer! Glory to Ukraine!"
We must integrate psychological support into all spheres of our lives - Olena Zelenska at the 75th World Health Assembly,2022-05-23T21:25:00Z,"Ukraine plans to set up a psychological assistance service to support war survivors. This was stated by First Lady Olena Zelenska during a speech at the 75th World Health Assembly, the highest governing body of the WHO. “Yes, war is a tragedy. But we must find an opportunity to do good even in the midst of the horrors of war. Let us use this period as an opportunity to integrate psychological support into all areas of our peaceful life. I hope for your support. Let's gain this victory together!” Olena Zelenska urged the attendees. The President's wife reminded that the WHO is committed to protecting the most crucial human rights - to life and health. These rights are currently being violated in Ukraine due to an armed attack by Russia. “None of the Ukrainians, neither an adult nor a child, can be sure that they will wake up tomorrow. That the missile will not fly into his house. The doctor cannot be sure that his ambulance will not be bombed on the way to the patient. Today, there are health ministers from different countries. This is especially important because we cannot now ensure the life and health of Ukrainians on our own. And your countries are coming to our aid,” she said. Olena Zelenska noted that the battles will end, every displaced Ukrainian will return, every family will be reunited, wounds will heal, and destroyed schools, orphanages and hospitals in Ukraine will be rebuilt. But the consequences of this war, unfortunately, will remain for years and decades. So today there is another task - the battle for the mental health of Ukrainian citizens. After the things Ukrainians experienced in the occupation, at the front, in bomb shelters, under shelling, abroad, they need rehabilitation just as the physically wounded, the President's wife is convinced. That is why the Office of the First Lady, together with representatives of the Ukrainian government in cooperation with civil society and international partners, is already launching a nationwide initiative to enhance mental health and psychosocial support. “We want to do it with you. Based on your best experience. We count on your expert support to build a truly efficient psychological care service in the world,” the President’s wife noted. The First Lady expressed her sincere hopes that Ukraine would set an example of strengthening global support for the mental health and psychosocial well-being of war survivors. And it will do it quickly, so that “along with the victory in the war, we also gain this victory - over the grief, shock and stress of our citizens."""
President presented the Order of the Golden Star to the servicemen and relatives of the fallen defenders who were conferred the title of Hero of Ukraine,2022-05-23T18:40:00Z,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy presented the Orders of the Golden Star to Ukrainian servicemen who have been conferred the title of Hero of Ukraine, as well as to members of the families of the fallen defenders who were posthumously conferred this title. The ceremony took place in the White Hall of Heroes of Ukraine at the Mariyinsky Palace in Kyiv. ""Every time we greet our defenders, relatives and friends of our Heroes, we emphasize the gratitude of our state to those whose courage allowed Ukraine to preserve independence and our freedom,"" he said. The President expressed gratitude to every defender of Ukraine. ""We must do everything necessary so that all of us and all future generations of Ukrainians remember their names,"" the President stressed. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that today the Day of the Marines is marked in Ukraine, and the warriors of this glorious kind of troops proved themselves brilliantly in the war for the independence of Ukraine. ""The courage of the Marines has many times helped defend the positions of our state,"" the President said. He stressed that the Marines successfully performed extremely difficult tasks independently and together with other units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. ""Marines were among the defenders of Mariupol. They heroically defended the city from much larger enemy forces. After that, the Russian occupiers will remember the strength of our Marines for a long time,"" the President said. The attendees honored the memory of the fallen defenders of Ukraine with a moment of silence. The ceremony was attended by Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak, Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksiy Danilov and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Valerii Zaluzhny."
Volodymyr Zelenskyy canceled “Russian warship… Done!” postage stamp issued on the Day of the Marines of Ukraine,2022-05-23T17:30:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy took part in the cancellation of the postage stamp of the ""Russian Warship…"" series, which was put into circulation by Ukrposhta specially on the Day of the Marines of Ukraine, May 23. Commander of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Oleksiy Neizhpapa and Director General of Ukrposhta Ihor Smilyanskyi took part in the special cancellation of the stamps together with the Head of State. These are the postage stamps “Russian warship… Done! Death to enemies!” for shipments in Ukraine and “Russian warship… Done! Glory to the nation!” for international shipments. They will be issued with a total circulation of 5 million copies. The head of the national postal operator reminded that the Russian missile cruiser Moskva sank 40 days ago, which was also a good reason to issue a new stamp. ""Things like this stamp are first and foremost symbols that help us believe in our victory. That we will definitely win this war, and the occupier will go to the bottom. People's interest in these stamps proves that. I am convinced that we will have many more such symbols of victory,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Ihor Smilyanskyi said that the stamps of the ""Russian warship… Done!"" series will be sold on world markets for the first time, and part of the income will be allocated to support the defenders of Ukraine. According to him, today the stamps will be canceled in all regions of the country, in particular in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Stamps will also be canceled in Kyiv for the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, the cities of Sevastopol and Kherson. Postage stamps ""Russian warship… Done!"" will be sold in more than 1,500 Ukrposhta offices. 1.5 million stamps will be sold on Ukrainian and international websites. There will be a limit on the sale of stamps: two sheets of stamps, five envelopes and five cards for one order."
"After the victory, we must create conditions in Ukraine for both people and businesses to feel safe - President",2022-05-23T16:51:00Z,"After winning the war against Russia, Ukraine will become a powerful and safe state that will get rid of corruption and oligarchic influence and will be able to defend its territory and people. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy while participating in the online format in the World Economic Forum in Davos. Answering the question of the moderator - founder of the World Economic Forum Klaus Schwab about the vision of the future of Ukraine, the Head of State stressed that today, as the leader of a country at war, he thinks more about the present and losses in the war. He added that Ukraine pays dearly for freedom, independence and struggle. At the same time, the President expressed conviction that our state will definitely win, as the Ukrainian people and army have already shown their strength and courage. ""It will be a strong state with concrete security priorities. We understand that anything can happen at any moment with such a neighbor, and, unfortunately, there can be war. The war may be repeated. I am convinced that we must create conditions so that people and businesses are not afraid to develop in our country,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The President stressed that the territory of Ukraine is large, so a solid system of defense must be created. ""Our task is to establish the most advanced air defense system, the most advanced multisystem of security. Our goal is to have a security treaty with other countries that we trust and consider partners. This treaty must be full-fledged, preferably ratified by the parliaments of the strategic partner countries. So that any chances of the aggressor for the future invasion will be eliminated before entering our land,"" the Head of State emphasized. According to the Head of State, the security of both people and business must be guaranteed in Ukraine. ""We do not intend to revive certain corruption steps, corrupt institutions, oligarchic influence. All this will not be the case in Ukraine. And none of this is there now. Exactly such a state – powerful, popular, technological and safe, ready to defend its land and people at any moment,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy summed up."
"At the forum in Davos, Volodymyr Zelenskyy proposed to create an organization that would prevent hunger in the world ",2022-05-23T16:39:00Z,"Ukraine proposes to create an organization of food-exporting states which would serve as a tool to combat hunger on the planet. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “Any response to the mass famine is overdue by definition. The famine should be stopped only preventively - when it has not yet begun. But now there is no such tool in the world. We propose to create an organization of responsible and democratic food-exporting states that can act with respect for human rights and global trade rules,” he said. According to the Head of State, no matter what the turning points in history, humanity must have insurance against hunger. “And Ukraine is ready to provide a platform for the activities of such a new organization - a definitely needed one,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted. Answering the questions of the moderator - founder of the World Economic Forum Klaus Schwab, the President called on the international community to help Ukraine unblock ports to avoid the global food crisis. ""You should know that grain is partly stolen every day by the Russian military, and then exported by ship to certain countries. We need to react very quickly. We at the level of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs work with the embassies of such countries, because if you understand where this grain comes from, where the Russian Federation transports it from, how can you buy it illegitimately just because it is sold to you almost for free,"" said the President. He called on other democracies to help Ukraine fight such actions by the Russian Federation at the diplomatic level, as it will be difficult for our state to do so on its own. During his speech, Volodymyr Zelenskyy also called for increased sanctions on Russia, without waiting for its next shot - the use of chemical, biological and, God forbid, nuclear weapons. “Do not give the aggressor the impression that the world will not show enough resistance. Protect freedom and normal, useful for all peaceful order in the world immediately and in full! That's what sanctions should be. Maximum. So that Russia and every other potential aggressor who wants to wage a brutal war against a neighbor knows exactly what this is leading to. And I think there are no such sanctions against Russia yet. And they must be imposed,” the President said. In particular, according to him, there should be an embargo on Russian oil, a complete blockade of all Russian banks, abandonment of the Russian IT sector and the cessation of any trade with the aggressor. The Head of State called on international companies to fully withdraw from the Russian market so that their brands, offices, accounts and commodities are not used by war criminals in their interests. “Values must matter. Especially since everyone suffers losses when a full-scale war begins and global markets are destabilized due to someone's neglect of values. For our part, we offer every company that leaves the Russian market to continue operating in Ukraine. You will get access not only to our market of 40 million consumers, but also to the common market of Europe. And at the same time, your brands, positions will only be enhanced due to the fact that you really support the protection of freedom,” the President noted. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the representatives of Ukraine in Davos are ready to inform about the details of the prospects that our country opens for business. The Head of State also stressed that his proposals were aimed against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. “We must not be afraid to set new precedents. This is exactly what the world has long had to learn at various turning points, for which it paid a high price. This was the price for the fact that the world only reacted, not acted preventively. So, now we can do it differently. Finally in the right way,” the President concluded."
Speech by Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak at the opening of the Russian War Crimes in the framework of the World Economic Forum in Davos,2022-05-23T15:12:00Z,"Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,  Dear guests. Thanks for having me here. I think today's event is very important. The world should know the truth. Home. Home is comfort. A place where you are well and safe. Home is a worldview. A place where your wishes come true. Home is the future. A place where your children grow. Home is the universe. The place where the journey begins. At our home, in my country, in Ukraine, there is a war. Hordes of butchers, rapists and murderers in Russian uniforms brought it. They look like human beings. But what they do on our land deprives them of the right to be called human. Their home is really the residence of evil. This should be said directly and clearly. Because that's the way the truth is told. From now on, war crime is Russia's second name. And amending the name of once the Russian House in Davos is not just symbolic. It's honest. It's fair. For it's exposing both Russia's worldview and Russia's universe. Anybody can see it's truth by themselves. Anyone can learn the names of those whom the so-called Russian liberators liberated from everything. From peace. From freedom. From life itself. Very often for fun and pleasure.  Still, I'm going to tell you a couple of life stories, real stories of our people. These are stories of Ukrainian children. Victims of war. Victims of genocide against the Ukrainian people. On April 9, Russian troops shelled Vuhledar. It's a city in Ukraine. Ten-year-old Veronica's hometown. They had shelled it on the eighth. And on the seventh. And the day before. All the time, the girl and her family were hiding in the basement. The tank shell flew right into the ventilation window. In a moment, Veronica lost her father, her grandmother, her uncle, and his wife. The girl has been in a coma for several days. Doctors say, she's got severe spinal cord and brain injuries. Veronica can walk already. She is working hard to exercise her paralyzed right arm. And here is the story of ten-year-old Illya. His native city of Mariupol, the name of this city is now famous in the whole world, became a war zone from the very beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion. He and his mother Natalia stayed in the city. At first, they had been hiding in their house basement. And then they lived there. One day they came under enemy fire. They ran to their neighbors for shelter. But luck betrayed them. The woman was wounded in the head. And the boy's foot was crushed. Somehow, Natalia brought her son to safety. Wounded and exhausted, they lay on the couch. Natalia was hugging Illya while her heart was beating. She was gone that night. The next day, the Russian military forcibly took the boy to occupied Novoazovsk. Then he was brought to Donetsk. Local doctors thought of amputating Illya's foot. But he was lucky this time. Meanwhile, Illya's grandmother in Ukraine was looking for a way to get her grandson back. She quickly obtained custody. Then, she crossed the borders of the four countries to take him home. But first, the boy had to get a long-term inpatient treatment. One day Ukrainian doctors said Illya's leg was fully functional and he would be able to walk. He considers the day his second birthday. Ilyusha can already move his toes. He is very determined to recover. He gets very joyful when guests come to him. But sadness remains in his eyes. It is impossible to imagine what this boy had to survive. His pain cannot be forgiven. These are just two stories. As of May 21, there were 660 more stories of wounded and killed children that we knew for sure. But it is impossible to say the exact number of kids who lost their health and lives to the Russian invasion. The war is still going on in Ukraine. None of these stories are about the collateral damage. They are all about genocide. Russian soldiers kill Ukrainians because they are Ukrainians. The Russian army is destroying Ukraine because it is Ukraine. This is the purpose and the goal of the invasion. Russian thugs in uniform seem to use the December 1948 UN Convention definitions of genocide as a source of their inspiration. Not a punishment warning. In addition to murders, torture, and mutilation because of belonging to a certain group, reduction and prevention of childbirth are also on the list. You might have seen footage of the maternity hospital bombed in Mariupol. But it's not the only one. Dozens of them were destroyed all over Ukraine. And there are thousands of damaged hospitals, schools and kindergartens. Forcible transfer of children to other groups is also the sign of genocide. Well. According to Russian sources, as of May 21, the state sponsor of terrorism had deported over two hundred and thirty-two thousand children to its territory. Over 2,000 of them are either orphaned or separated from their parents. Meanwhile, the Russian parliament is preparing to simplify the Ukrainian children adoption by the Russian nationals. It's not about humanism. It's about a frenzy of hatred and destruction under the slogans of humanism. Genocide is one of the vilest crimes known to mankind. It employs pathological sadists, gullible fools, and greatness-thirsty duffers. But the worst thing is that silent people endorse it. The people who lose their humanity because of fear of their own tyrant. Davos is a place of strength. For half a century, a new world has been created here. If I were honored to create the Davos Forum slogan, I think, I would suggest ""Respect. Synergy. Concord."" But today a new world is being born in my country, Ukraine. We are defending from the brutal and ruthless force. We are resisting an empire that sees genocide and crimes against humanity as routine, not taboo. But we are fighting not just for ourselves. The fate of Europe and the world is at stake. Evil has to be stopped for the future's sake. It always comes back if unpunished."
We should not be afraid to set new precedents - speech by the President of Ukraine at the World Economic Forum in Davos,2022-05-23T14:55:00Z,"Dear Mr. Executive Chairman, Professor Schwab, Dear President Cassis, Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear attendees! I am grateful for this opportunity to take part in the discussion at the Forum. The general theme of Davos this year is: History at a Turning Point: Government Policies and Business Strategies. And this year the words ""turning point"" are not just a rhetorical figure. This is really the moment when it is decided whether brute force will rule the world. If it reigns, our thoughts won't matter to it. And we may no longer convene in Davos. Because what for? Brute force seeks nothing but the subjugation of those it wants to subdue. And it does not discuss, but kills at once, as Russia is doing in Ukraine right now, right at this time when we are talking. By the way, please look at the building of the former Russian House in Davos. It has been turned into a house of Russian war crimes. And this is an example of their transformation. What Russia has done to itself by becoming a state of war crimes. And what it brings to the world. Inspiring other potential aggressors. Instead of successful peaceful cities - black ruins. Instead of normal trade - mined sea and blocked ports in Ukraine. Instead of tourism - closed skies and thousands of Russian bombs and cruise missiles. This is what the world will look like if humanity misses this turning point. It will look like a very large collection of war crimes. So, history remembers many moments when everything changed dramatically. It remembers, for example, how just a few shots can lead to millions of casualties. If these were the shots on June 28, 1914 in Sarajevo. History remembers how much grief one person’s evil can cause if he sees that he is not being resisted enough. As it was, for example, in 1938 in Munich. Historical twists were noticeable and not as much. But it was always necessary to react to them. Trying to prepare for other historical upheavals - as they say, to soften the blow. Or - trying to heal the wounds of catastrophes that were behind one or another historical turn. And now we have a large collection of such reactions: the UN Charter with all units of the Organization, the OSCE, the IAEA, the WTO and many, many other important institutions. But are they enough to respond to what we are facing today? And is it enough now to try to adapt those institutions to modern challenges? Definitely not. We need to change the approach. Not to react, but to act. And act preventively. And not only to adapt what we have to the new realities, but also to create new tools. New precedents. Look at what Ukraine has already done. We have set a historical precedent for courage. Without listening to those who said that our defense would not last longer than a few days. We have stopped the Russian army, which was called the second in the world, and at the cost of heavy fighting and thousands of lives, we are gradually driving the occupiers out of our land. But would we have to do that if we had been listened to last year and if the full range of sanctions that can knock down any aggressor had been applied fairly and preventively against the Russian Federation? I'm sure the answer is “no”. Preventing war would be guaranteed if the world's actions had been preventive rather than responsive. Ukraine has set another precedent in these three months. A precedent for the unprecedented unity of the democratic world around the emotion of genuine admiration for Ukrainian courage and around the understanding that freedom must be fought for. And now hundreds of millions of people in democracies are putting pressure, supporting and putting pressure on the governments and companies to limit relations with the aggressor state, Russia, and to help the people they have attacked. But this is happening only now, although Russia started a war against Ukraine in 2014. We are grateful for such support, but if it had happened then - immediately - this unity and this pressure on governments, on companies for the struggle for freedom, would Russia have started this full-scale war and inflicted all these losses to Ukraine and the world? I am sure that the answer to this question is “no” as well. Now we see that the world listens and believes Ukraine. But there is also a certain expectation in the world how this situation will be resolved. What tools will work? What new can we create to prevent such aggressions? And how do we stop the brute force that has challenged everything we really value? That's what a turning point means. Ladies and Gentlemen! Don't wait for the fatal strikes. Don't wait until Russia uses special weapons - chemical, biological and, God forbid, nuclear. Do not give the aggressor the impression that the world will not show enough resistance. Protect freedom and normal, useful for all peaceful order in the world immediately and in full! That's what sanctions should be. Maximum. So that Russia and every other potential aggressor who wants to wage a brutal war against a neighbor knows exactly what this is leading to. And I think there are no such sanctions against Russia yet. And they must be imposed. Russian oil embargo. Complete blocking of all banks without exception - all. Complete abandonment of the Russian IT sector. Complete cessation of trade with the aggressor. This should be a precedent of sanctions pressure that will work convincingly for decades to maintain peace. It is necessary to set a precedent for the complete exit of all foreign businesses from the Russian market. So that your brands are not associated with war crimes. That your offices, accounts, commodities are not used by war criminals in their bloody interests. Values must matter. Especially since everyone suffers losses when a full-scale war begins and global markets are destabilized due to someone’s neglect of values. For our part, we offer every company that leaves the Russian market to continue operating in Ukraine. You will get access not only to our market of 40 million consumers, but also to the common market of Europe. And at the same time - your brands, positions will only be enhanced due to the fact that you really support the protection of freedom. Our representatives here in Davos can inform each and every one of you about the details of the prospects that Ukraine opens for businesses. Ladies and Gentlemen! We offer the world to set a precedent for rebuilding the country after the war, which will show everyone who dreams of destroying the life of a neighbor that the war doesn’t bring the expected result. I invite you to take part in this reconstruction. The amount of work is enormous. We have more than half a trillion dollars in losses. Tens of thousands of objects were destroyed. We need to rebuild entire cities, entire industries. And we offer a special - historically significant - model of reconstruction. When each of the partner countries or partner cities or partner companies will have the opportunity - historical one - to take patronage over a particular region of Ukraine, city, community or industry. Britain, Denmark, the European Union and other leading international actors have already chosen a specific direction for patronage in reconstruction. Thanks to this model of relations, post-war reconstruction can be fast, efficient and high-quality. And this will not only attract the world's best specialists - architects, engineers, builders, developers, managers and others. It will also be the largest opportunity for economic leap in Europe since World War II. And I hope that by the beginning of the international conference in Lugano in July this year dedicated to the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine, which Mr. Cassis spoke about, all our partner countries and most of the world's leading companies will have formed their own packages of proposals. By the way, given the presence of President Cassis today, I would like to thank Switzerland for organizing this Conference in Lugano and supporting our efforts. I would also like to note the efforts of Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen, in particular the proposal to create a Reconstruction Platform, which will be managed jointly by Ukraine and the European Commission and will direct European Union resources to restore normal life in our country. However the list of new precedents needed will not be complete without a few more important decisions. There must be a precedent of punishment for the aggressor and investment in a peaceful life. Russian assets scattered in different jurisdictions must be found, arrested or frozen, and then confiscated and sent to a special Fund from which all victims of this war can receive compensation. Of course, this is not easy. But after that, there will be no motivation left for the various aggressors to do what Russia has done and continues to do. If the aggressor loses everything, it definitely deprives him of motivation to start a war. Let's move on. Any response to the mass famine is overdue by definition. The famine should be stopped only preventively - when it has not yet begun. But now there is no such tool in the world. We propose to create an organization of responsible and democratic food-exporting states that can act with respect for human rights and global trade rules. Our motivation is very simple. Whatever the turning points in history, humanity must have insurance against famine. And Ukraine is ready to provide a platform for the activities of such a new organization - a definitely needed one. And the last point. You know, this war of Russia against Ukraine convinces everyone that aid to the attacked state is more valuable the sooner it is provided. Weapons, finances, political support, sanctions against Russia - if we had received them one hundred percent of our needs in February, the result would be tens of thousands of lives saved. That is why Ukraine needs all the weapons we ask for, not just the ones we are given. That is why Ukraine needs finances. That's at least $ 5 billion a month. And all the funds needed for reconstruction. That is why the United24 Ukraine Recovery Fund was established. And we encourage you to join the support using this platform. Ukrainian state platform. For each donor, we give a specific proposal - how to help and where to send funds. Where the priority is now. The target nature of the work is an absolute priority. And in the future, under this brand, United24, we propose to create a global structure that can provide sufficient support within 24 hours for any country that has suffered a military attack, natural disaster or, for example, a pandemic. That is, we offer a new format of security guarantees. Based on what we went through. What we are going through now. There must be something that sets a precedent of absolutely timely assistance. To everyone who needs it. To preserve peace, to preserve life, to preserve social stability. That is, all the necessary elements for a normal economy. Like, for example, the 911 service, there must be a United24 that guarantees security on a global scale. Ladies and Gentlemen! George Marshall, a well-remembered man, said in 1947: ""Our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine but against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. Its purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist."" These words are still relevant today. My proposals are directed in the same way - against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. And of course against the war unleashed by Russia, which brings nothing but hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. To many in the world. Not just us. Therefore, in order to guarantee peace and tranquility, we must all act quickly and preventively. We must not be afraid to set new precedents. This is exactly what the world has long had to learn at various turning points, for which it paid a high price. This was the price for the fact that the world only reacted, not acted preventively. So, now we can do it differently. Finally in the right way. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!"
Ukraine expands its international ties every week to get everything it needs to end the war as soon as possible - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-05-22T23:31:00Z,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! Today was a real Polish day. I was glad to welcome the President of our fraternal Poland and my friend Andrzej Duda in Kyiv. First, on May 3, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson addressed our Verkhovna Rada online. And today - already personally - there was the President of Poland. And, by the way, this line of cooperation - Ukraine - Poland, Ukraine - Britain was really very effective and remains so during this war. I am glad to note that Ukrainian-Polish relations are finally on a completely clean, sincere basis, without any quarrels and old conflict heritage. This is an achievement. The historical achievement of our nations. And I want the brotherhood between Ukrainians and Poles to be preserved forever. As I said about this today to the deputies: for our unity, the unity of Ukrainians and Poles, to be a constant value that no one will violate. I signed a decree on the introduction of a new award of Ukraine - to thank those cities of partner countries that have helped the most. And Rzeszów became the first such city. The rescuer city. Quite rightly. Another decision I announced today is the preparation of a bill that will be a mirror image of the law on our citizens, Ukrainians, passed in Poland. What is this law? Ukrainian men and women temporarily staying in Poland fleeing the war have de facto and de jure been given the same opportunities as Poles. And it will be the right gesture to pass such a law in Ukraine. Let it be so that the citizens of Poland will never have to use such a law. But let us show our gratitude and our respect. And I also want it to be part of our new neighborhood policy. We must resolve disputes and remove the pressure of the past from our current relations with all Ukraine's neighbors who respect us and are not occupiers of our state. A decision has been reached that is revolutionizing the order on our border. We are introducing joint customs control with Poland. This will significantly speed up border procedures. It will remove most of the corruption risks. But it is also the beginning of our integration into the common customs space of the European Union. That is a truly historical process. Of course, Andrzej and I also talked today about the defense support for Ukraine. And about strengthening sanctions against Russia. And about the steps we need to take to achieve our common goal - full membership of Ukraine in the EU. I am grateful to Andrzej and all the Polish people for the fact that we are going along this path as quickly as possible. In the evening I spoke with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson. I told Boris about our meeting, about the negotiations, about the situation on the battlefield. We are looking for ways to increase the volume of our exports, especially agricultural products. As well as the volume of fuel imports to Ukraine. I am preparing to start a new week of maximum diplomatic activity in the interests of our state. On Monday I will join the discussions at the Davos Forum. This is the world's most influential economic platform where Ukraine has something to say. There will be other public speeches during the week, including an address to the Stanford University community. As well as a special format of communication with the political and expert communities of Indonesia. Of course, the schedule also includes a large number of contacts at the bilateral level with representatives of various states and international organizations. Our state expands its international ties every week to get everything it needs to end the war as soon as possible. There will be a new meeting of representatives of the partner countries - ""Ramstein-2"", if we call this group after the place of the first meeting in Germany. We look forward to new useful decisions for our defense. I signed a decree on awarding our military. 194 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 44 of them posthumously. Everyone should always remember these people. Those who give their lives for Ukraine. So that all generations of our people can live freely and choose independently with whom to be friends, whom to respect and what values to pass on to their children. Eternal glory to all who stood up for Ukraine! Eternal memory to each and every one whose lives were taken by the Russian invaders. Glory to Ukraine!"
"Volodymyr Zelenskyy supports Andrzej Duda's initiative for a new good-neighborly agreement between Ukraine and Poland, which would help enhance relations between the two countries",2022-05-22T19:45:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed support for the initiative of Polish President Andrzej Duda to conclude a new good-neighborly agreement that would help maintain warm relations between the nations of the two countries. He said this during a meeting with media representatives following talks with Andrzej Duda in Kyiv. ""I do not want our nations to risk our relations Relations with Poland today are one of the highest priorities for Ukraine. I am sure that they are now the most powerful in the history of our nations. And I really want us to have agreements not for the sake of agreements, but concrete, substantive ones that can only improve our lives, enhance the relations of our societies,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The President of Ukraine is convinced that such a document should first be worked on by specialists, after which the presidents of the two states will move to the political part, in particular to the coordination of certain issues. For his part, Andrzej Duda noted that it would be symbolic to sign such an agreement between Ukraine and Poland by January 2023, marking the 160th anniversary of the January Uprising, during which Poles and Ukrainians fought against the domination of the Russian Empire. ""It is difficult for me to say now whether we will be able to work out new decisions by this time, but I am sure of one thing: today we are in a completely different situation, and this situation creates a new picture. First of all, it creates a new perspective,"" he stressed. The President of Poland suggested that the leaders of the two countries, together with experts, prepare an agreement that would accelerate the implementation of new prospects and opportunities. ""It would be a big mistake if we did not use this chance,"" said Andrzej Duda."
Poland today demonstrates historical level of support for Ukraine - Volodymyr Zelenskyy following the meeting with Andrzej Duda in Kyiv,2022-05-22T18:17:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with President of the Republic of Poland Andrzej Duda who is on a visit to Ukraine. The heads of state talked in a vis-a-vis format. Then, talks between the Ukrainian and Polish delegations chaired by the presidents took place. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that today Poland is showing a historical level of support for Ukraine, our Armed Forces and citizens who were forced to leave their homes due to the Russian invasion. ""And today the President of Poland also said: Ukraine protects the rights and freedoms not only of its own, but also of every European country. Our friendly Poland and the whole European Union,"" the President said during a meeting with media representatives following talks with Andrzej Duda in Kyiv. According to the President of Ukraine, during the Russian aggression, the Ukrainian and Polish nations show strong ties at various levels. ""We will do everything in our power to ensure that we do not lose this friendship, this warm and strategic partnership,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. According to the Head of State, during the meeting with Andrzej Duda, in particular, the issue of strengthening the Armed Forces of Ukraine was discussed. ""We are grateful to Poland - they worked constantly, every day. And I want to note the special personal role of the President of the Republic of Poland in strengthening (the Armed Forces of Ukraine - ed.) and in the supply of weapons,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Also, according to the President of Ukraine, the current situation on the food market was discussed, in particular, the shortage of food products. ""Now we are thinking about unblocking the supply of our grain, etc. to European countries, Asia and Africa. Here we also work together with our Polish partners,"" the President said. In addition, the parties discussed topical issues of economic relations between Ukraine and Poland. Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for the representatives of the governments of the two states to hold a meeting in the near future to discuss the mentioned issues. ""It is important today to talk about the reconstruction of Ukraine. This is a signal that we will definitely win, I'm sure of it. And to rebuild Ukraine, we need the unity of the countries of the European Union, the United States, and all our friends. And we see Poland among the leading countries that will be in the program of reconstruction of Ukraine,"" the President said. Also, according to him, Poland today plays an important role in Ukraine's movement towards membership in the European Union, because it understands as no one that our country has actually been part of Europe for a long time already. ""We think alike, we believe alike and we defend our freedom and independence. But there are bureaucratic, technical things, and on this path we need powerful ambassadors. And Poland is one of such countries,"" the President said, adding that Ukraine expects to receive EU candidate status in June this year. Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked all Poles for their help to Ukrainians who had to flee the war, and noted that after the victory he would be happy to visit those Polish cities that stood out in support of Ukraine and our citizens in these difficult times. For his part, Polish President Andrzej Duda stressed that Russia's war against Ukraine is not over, it is a given, people are still dying. ""Everything that is happening today in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions - a normal person cannot imagine it. Hundreds of people give their lives every day. This is the scale of the war, which Europe and the world have not seen for a long time,"" he said. Andrzej Duda is convinced that the end of the war requires support for Ukraine by the international community, not only humanitarian, but also military assistance. ""Ukraine needs weapons. Ukrainians have great morale and determination, but they need modern equipment to defeat such an enemy,"" said the President of Poland. He also stressed the importance of coordinated, strong sanctions pressure on Russia. It is necessary to isolate it at the international level and stop doing ""business as usual"". In addition, according to Andrzej Duda, sanctions are needed that will affect Russia's image, including expulsions from international organizations, sports associations, etc. ""We must find a way to create a situation where the war will completely cease to be beneficial to Russia, and will be a threat to Russia itself,"" he said. The Polish leader also stressed the need to already think about rebuilding Ukraine after the war. At the end of the meeting, the President of Ukraine presented Ukrainian vyshyvankas to Andrzej Duda and the First Lady of Poland Agata Kornhauser-Duda."
Volodymyr Zelenskyy conferred the honorary title of the Rescuer City to Rzeszów and invited the Rada to expand the rights of Polish citizens in Ukraine,2022-05-22T16:24:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the signing of Decree № 355/2022 on the establishment of the honorary title ""Rescuer City"", and the first to receive this title was the Polish city of Rzeszów. The Head of State said this in a speech in the framework of joint participation with President of the Republic of Poland Andrzej Duda in the plenary session of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. “Before this speech, I signed a decree noting the special role of the Polish city of Rzeszów. I have introduced a special honorary title of ""rescuer city"" for the partner cities of our state, which today do the impossible to help us, to help our people, to help our army. On behalf of the entire Ukrainian people, I would like to express great gratitude to the city of Rzeszów, the first rescuer city,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The President noted that almost all Ukrainian cities are sister cities of those in Poland. Our nations are also brothers, and our countries are sisters. “We are relatives. And there should be no borders or barriers between us. The Ukrainian and Polish nations have not been mentally separated for a long time. So we agreed to implement this in the near future in the relevant bilateral agreement. First on joint border and customs control, and later on the conditional border when Ukraine becomes a member of the European Union,” the Head of State stressed. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also thanked Andrzej Duda for his readiness to visit the European capitals together with President of Slovakia Zuzana Čaputová in order to lobby for Ukraine's membership in the EU. The Head of State also thanked Polish cultural figures, sportsmen, clergy and ordinary people who support Ukrainians: organize big concerts, take part in competitions with the Ukrainian ribbon, or come from Poznań to Bucha just to bake bread. The President noted the decision of the Polish Sejm, which grants Ukrainian citizens, who were forced to move temporarily to Poland due to the aggression of the Russian Federation, almost the same rights and opportunities as Polish citizens have: legal residence, employment, education, medical care, social guarantees.  “This is a great step, a great gesture of a great soul, which only a great friend of Ukraine is capable of. And this step will not remain unilateral. I believe that in the near future we must submit to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine a similar - mirror - bill. God forbid that Polish citizens will ever need all these advantages in such conditions, in conditions of war. But these laws are of great symbolic significance. They show that Ukrainians and Poles are native and equal. And I am sure that the parliamentary corps of Ukraine will support this law - quickly and, I am sure, by a majority of votes,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. “The unity of our nations must remain constant. Neither now nor in the future does anyone have the right to break this unity. Neither our politicians, nor hostile agents, nor even members of the jury at Eurovision. The Ukrainian and Polish nations gave each other 12 points - today and forever,” he added. For his part, Andrzej Duda assured in his speech that Poland will never leave Ukraine alone. He stressed that the free world today has the face of Ukraine. ""I believe that this new friendship between millions of Ukrainians and Poles will lead to the fact that we will be good neighbors forever. This is a great historical chance,"" said the President of Poland. He also thanked the Ukrainian people for their courage, love of freedom, heroic resistance and protection of their Homeland and the whole of Europe from Russian barbarism and imperialism. Andrzej Duda expressed confidence that Ukraine will receive the status of a candidate for EU membership, and later will definitely become a member of the European Union."
Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during the joint participation with President of the Republic of Poland Andrzej Duda in the plenary session of the Verkhovna Rada,2022-05-22T16:03:00Z,"Dear Chairman, presidium. Dear people's deputies of Ukraine, Dear guests. Andrzej. Ladies and Gentlemen! Guest in the house, God in the house. This is a Polish proverb with which I greet in Kyiv our guest, friend and brother, President of Poland Andrzej Duda. This folk wisdom tells that each of your guests is a grace of God. And this is the worldview according to which the Poles from the very beginning of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, Russia's war against Ukraine, sheltered millions of our citizens - citizens of Ukraine. Our women, our children, the elderly and everyone else whose door was knocked on on February 24 by completely different guests. Guests whom we never wanted to have and who have other proverbs and other folk wisdom. Russia has been proving this ""otherness"" for 88 days. 88 days of madness: their missiles, bombs, projectiles fly into houses, schools, hospitals, museums, theaters, temples, even cemeteries. At the same time, without realizing it, on February 24, Russia destroyed something else as well. A kind of ""repository"" of past contradictions between Ukraine and Poland. They no longer exist. In a day it became clear that all these contradictions have no force when there is the force of such a threat. Threat to the survival of our nations - Ukraine, Poland, the nations of Europe. Andrzej and I sought a true understanding between our nations, and together we dismantled this ""repository."" We planned to build a Memorial of Reconciliation on the common border of Ukraine and Poland. But those who want other memorials, dedicated not to peace at all, have crossed Ukrainian borders.  February 24 changed everything. It changed our nations. Changed our countries. Although this is not accidental. I do not know whether our astronomers Drohobych and Copernicus studied this phenomenon, but the stars are always formed in such a way that during the most difficult periods of eclipse Ukrainians and Poles unite and stand side by side, despite past quarrels and ""nebulae"". We are defending a common universe for us called freedom and independence, at a time when someone is committing barbarism of a cosmic scale. Today the understanding, interaction, friendship and brotherhood of Ukraine and Poland reach the same scale. On February 24, we began writing a new volume of our history. Our common history - it is important. The unity of our nations must last forever. It must never again be dishonored by enmity. St. John Paul II called the incitement of hatred between us a blatant anachronism unworthy of our two great nations. In various letters to our nations, the Pontiff said: “The new millennium requires that Ukrainians and Poles not remain enslaved by sad memories of the past. By committing to a better future for all, let them look at each other with a look of reconciliation. Our two nations have experienced so much bitterness and pain over the past few decades. Let this experience serve as purification. Let everyone be willing to put what unites above what divides. Look for something that cures. So that together they may build a future based on mutual respect, brotherhood, fraternal cooperation and true solidarity."" Learn to appreciate, distinguish, choose. Ukraine and Poland have chosen one path. This path. On it we learned to distinguish enemies and appreciate friends. Appreciate each other and most importantly - respect. The time that Jerzy Giedroyc and Bohdan Osadchuk dreamed of has come. About which Juliusz Słowacki, whose monument stands in Kyiv, and Taras Shevchenko, whose monument stands in Warsaw, wrote. Today, half a word is enough for Polish President Andrzej and I to understand each other. Our parliaments, our governments and our nations in general understand each other as never before. And it doesn't matter whether it is Cyrillic or Latin, it doesn't matter how we write the words ""freedom"" and ""independence"". It is important that Ukrainians and Poles say these things in the same way. And are equally ready to defend them. Ukraine is already doing this. On the very frontline. It defends not just itself but the whole of Europe. Poles know this, appreciate, respect and help Ukraine - not out of courtesy, but as brothers and allies who remember Lech Kaczyński's words about who could be next. This does not mean fear. This means readiness to face the enemy and repel him. That is why, for example, we have the same perception of the sanctions policy against the Russian Federation. We know that half-measures cannot be used when aggression needs to be stopped. Now. Poland is one of the leaders not only in supporting our state, but also in defending and promoting the sanctions that are absolutely necessary to force Russia into peace. The absolute majority of Poles support the embargo on energy resources from Russia. This is just one manifestation - but how important it is - of our common vision of the political front in this war. I believe that Poland's leadership will help establish at the European level what our nations already understand. The unity of our nations must remain constant. Neither now nor in the future does anyone have the right to break this unity. Neither our politicians, nor hostile agents, nor even members of the jury at Eurovision. The Ukrainian and Polish nations gave each other 12 points - today and forever. I want to thank all Poles for their support. I want to remember everyone from this rostrum. So that every voivodeship, powiat and gmina hears this. Whose support and help is felt in every region, every city, village, in every community of Ukraine. Thank you, Warsaw, Kraków. Thank you, Łódź, Poznań, Wrocław. Thank you Gdańsk, Bydgoszcz, Toruń. Thank you, Lublin, Katowice, Opole, Szczecin. Gorzów Wielkopolski, Zielona Góra. Thank you, Rzeszów, Białystok, Olsztyn, Kielce. These are sister cities of our cities - Kyiv, Lviv, Odesa, Kharkiv, Kremenchuk, Kryvyi Rih, Cherkasy, Luhansk, Donetsk, Sumy, Izyum, Starobilsk, Mariupol. Almost all our cities are sister cities of those in Poland. Our nations are also brothers. Our countries are sisters. We are relatives. And there should be no borders or barriers between us. The Ukrainian and Polish nations have not been mentally separated for a long time. So we agreed to implement this in the near future in the relevant bilateral agreement. First on joint border and customs control, and later on the conditional border when Ukraine becomes a member of the European Union. And I am sure that all the necessary decisions will be made first for the status of a candidate for Ukraine, and then for full membership. In particular, thanks to Poland's many years of protection of Ukrainian interests on the European continent. And I am grateful for your willingness - for your willingness personally, Andrzej - to pay a visit to European capitals together with President of Slovakia Zuzana Čaputová to lobby for Ukraine's membership in the European Union in countries - as they say, ""skeptics"". In fact, they are not skeptics, but future optimists. This is how I see our common very important task in this direction. Separately, I thank the Polish Sejm for the recently adopted law on assistance to the citizens of Ukraine. This is a completely unprecedented decision, according to which our citizens, who were forced to move temporarily to Poland due to the aggression of the Russian Federation, will receive almost the same rights and opportunities as Polish citizens. Legal residence, employment, education, medical care, social guarantees. This is a great step, a great gesture of a great soul, which only a great friend of Ukraine is capable of. And this step will not remain unilateral. I believe that in the near future we must submit to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine a similar - mirror - bill. God forbid that Polish citizens will ever need all these advantages in such conditions, in conditions of war. But these laws are of great symbolic significance. They show that Ukrainians and Poles are native and equal. And I am sure that the parliamentary corps of Ukraine will support this law - quickly and, I am sure, by a majority of votes. In addition, before this speech, I signed a decree noting the special role of the Polish city of Rzeszów. I have introduced a special honorary title of ""rescuer city"" for the partner cities of our state, which today do the impossible to help us, to help our people, to help our army. On behalf of the entire Ukrainian people, I would like to express great gratitude to the city of Rzeszów, the first rescuer city. I also want to thank Polish cultural figures, sportsmen, clergy and ordinary people who support us - organize big concerts, take part in competitions with the Ukrainian ribbon, or come from Poznań to Bucha just to bake bread. I believe that soon Ukrainians and Poles will gather at one big table to share this bread. Share the feelings - the most important feelings - of peace. Share the taste of victory. Victory of Ukraine. Joint victory. And raise a toast to your and our freedom. Without a free Ukraine, there can be no free Poland. I know historians often argue about who was the first to say this, who was the author of this phrase. We have resolved this dispute - this is the will of the Ukrainian and Polish nations. Thank you brothers! Together until the end. Niech żyje Polska! Glory to Ukraine!"
"The war continues, and each of us must take care of the defense every day - address by the President of Ukraine",2022-05-21T23:45:00Z,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! This day in our state has a double meaning. This is Science Day. And Europe Day. I congratulate our scientists, who, despite all the difficulties, nevertheless work to ensure that Ukraine preserves and develops its scientific potential. Of course, during a full-scale war, all the forces of society and the state can be aimed only at protection. And these are significant limitations for science, for the cultural sphere, for other fundamental parts of public life. But such is the time we live in. We are doing everything we can to return to the rules of peacetime as soon as possible. I would also like to express my gratitude to all those who are working to make Ukraine a part of a united Europe. To all our diplomats, to all our civil servants who now have a few weeks to complete the task that other countries have been overcoming for years when joining the European Union. And I want to emphasize that our European integration path is not just about politics. It's about quality of life. And about the fact that Ukrainians perceive the values of life in the same way as the vast majority of Europeans. I held talks with the Prime Minister of Portugal in Kyiv today. I thanked him for all the support that Portugal is currently providing to Ukraine. This is defense, political and humanitarian support. I am grateful for the warm treatment of our people who have taken refuge in Portugal. Further sanctions against the Russian Federation were discussed with the Prime Minister. And also - post-war reconstruction of our state. Portugal is ready to join the reconstruction of Ukraine, the reconstruction of Ukrainian schools and kindergartens. And I want to remind you that during the full-scale war, the Russian army has already destroyed 1873 educational institutions. This is a colossal scale of losses. But when a united Europe, American leadership and the whole free world stand with you, you can overcome that as well. I am grateful to President Biden for the immediate signing of the $ 40 billion support package for Ukraine approved by the US Congress. This is a historic contribution to the protection of freedom in Europe. I also spoke today with Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi. The main focus was on the situation on the battlefield and how Ukraine's victory can be brought closer. We agreed that the sixth package of sanctions against Russia should be accelerated. I am grateful for Italy's full support on our path to the European Union. The military situation has not changed significantly today. But it was really hard. Actually, the fact that we are able to say this on the 87th day of a full-scale war against Russia is good news. Russia has sent virtually all its resources to destroy us. In the Russian regions, it is openly said that their so-called ""special operation"" is the cause of the economic downturn - in particular, in the industries such as construction and many others. And also the reason for the impoverishment of people, which may be even greater than in the 1990s. Rising prices, devaluation of income, destruction of all the economic potential that has been created in Russia since the 2000s - all this does not stop the invaders yet. But the colossal costs of the war still do not help them. And will not help. The situation in Donbas is extremely difficult. As in previous days, the Russian army is trying to attack Slovyansk and Severodonetsk. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are deterring this offensive. Every day that our defenders take away from these offensive plans of Russia, disrupting them, is a concrete contribution to the approach of the main day. The desired day that we are all looking forward to and fighting for. Victory Day. And no Russian strikes - neither by missiles in the Rivne region, nor by artillery in the Kharkiv or Sumy region, nor by all possible weapons in Donbas - will give Russia any result. Today I signed a decree on awarding our heroes. 215 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 30 of them posthumously. Almost every day I have such decrees on my desk. On awarding our defenders. On conferring the title of Hero of Ukraine. And this reflects the severity of the military situation. Unfortunately, the war continues. The war is not over. We still need to fight and move towards victory. Maybe someone in the rear cities thinks that one can forget about the war. And become carefree. Or even careless. It isn't so. Every day Ukrainians die for our independence. Every day! And each and every one of us must take care of our defense on a daily basis. With anything they can. In a way they can. Eternal glory to all who stood up for Ukraine! Eternal memory to everyone who gave lives for our state! Glory to Ukraine!"
Ihor Zhovkva met with members of the Italian parliament,2022-05-21T20:51:00Z,"Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Ihor Zhovkva met with Chairman of the Interparliamentary Relations Group with Ukraine in the Italian Parliament Ugo Cappellacci and Member of the Foreign Affairs Commission Matteo Perego di Cremnago. Ihor Zhovkva thanked the leadership of the Italian Republic, parliamentarians and the entire Italian people for their clear and unequivocal support for Ukraine after the beginning of Russia's armed aggression, which was shown not only by political statements, but also by concrete actions, including significant assistance. ""We appreciate the care and support that Italy has provided to Ukrainian citizens who have been forced to flee their homes as a result of the aggressor's invasion,"" said Ihor Zhovkva. Ugo Cappellacci reaffirmed that Italy would continue to support Ukrainians in their defense of their country and European democracy in general. The parliamentary delegation was greatly shocked by the terrible consequences of the war in the city of Bucha, which the parliamentarians visited. Ihor Zhovkva informed his interlocutors about the President's initiative of patronage over the affected Ukrainian cities and regions. In this regard, it was noted that the Italian government is considering the possibility of joining the reconstruction of Ukraine. The Deputy Head of the Office of the President expressed expectation that Italy would clearly support the sixth package of EU sanctions, primarily on the oil embargo and the disconnection of all Russian banks from SWIFT. The parliamentarians said that Italy continues to actively seek and establish alternative ways to supply energy to the country to strengthen its energy independence. Recent European integration steps of Ukraine were also discussed during the meeting. ""Ukraine has promptly completed its part of the job to obtain the status of a candidate for EU membership, now the ball is in the court of the European Union,"" said Ihor Zhovkva. The participants agreed that the unanimous position of the EU member states on granting Ukraine the status of a candidate country for accession to the European Union in June 2022 would be an important symbolic and political step in recognizing the European prospects of the Ukrainian people."

Andriy Yermak noted the importance of resuming the work of diplomatic missions and stressed: ""This is a powerful signal for Ukrainians, a demonstration of faith in our country and its victory."" The Head of the President's Office informed his interlocutors about the situation at the front, where the Ukrainian people are bravely defending their land from the Russian aggressor. Andriy Yermak noted that the Ukrainian state seeks to end this war as soon as possible. But this requires appropriate conditions, including practical defense support from our partners, which will help not only repel the aggressor's pressure, but also to liberate the temporarily occupied territories. ""Ukraine aims to return its territories,"" he said. The Head of the Office of the President paid special attention to the need to strengthen the coordinated sanctions pressure of the international community on Russia, in particular, the approval of the sixth package of sanctions and the start of work on the seventh package. ""Russia must feel the impact of sanctions as soon as possible,"" said Andriy Yermak. He also emphasized the continuation of work on the creation of an international legal mechanism to compensate Ukraine for the damage caused by Russia as a result of the war. He also spoke about the coordination of work on the investigation of crimes against children committed by the aggressor country and the facts of illegal forced deportation of young Ukrainians. ""All citizens forcibly deported to Russia, including children, must return home,"" the Head of the President's Office said. Andriy Yermak informed European diplomats about the work already underway on a comprehensive plan for Ukraine's post-war reconstruction and welcomed signals of the readiness of a number of EU member states, as well as the EU itself, to join its implementation. During the meeting, the parties also exchanged views on the most pressing issues, including key practical areas of assistance to our country, new challenges posed by Russian aggression, as well as prospects for the security situation in the region."
"If the world does not help Ukraine unblock its ports, the energy crisis will be followed by a food crisis - President",2022-05-21T17:19:00Z,"The world community must help Ukraine unblock seaports, otherwise the energy crisis will be followed by a food crisis and many more countries will face it, said President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ""Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food - our grain, barley, sunflower and more. A lot of things,"" the Head of State said during a meeting with media representatives following negotiations with Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa in Kyiv. According to the President of Ukraine, currently the Russian Federation has blocked 22 million tons of food products. The aggressor country is gradually stealing it and trying to sell it. ""There will be a crisis in the world. The second crisis after the energy one, which was provoked by Russia. Now it will create a food crisis if we do not unblock the routes for Ukraine, do not help the countries of Africa, Europe, Asia, which need these food products. You can unblock them in different ways. One of the ways is a military solution. That is why we turn to our partners with inquiries regarding the relevant weapons,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy added. For his part, the Prime Minister of Portugal noted that his country has already sent military aid to our country. These are non-lethal and lethal weapons in accordance with Ukraine's requests. And the provision of such assistance continues."
Volodymyr Zelenskyy expects positive decisions from the second meeting of partner countries in the Ramstein format,2022-05-21T16:32:00Z,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expects that the result of the second meeting of the partner countries in the composition in which they met at Ramstein Air Base, scheduled for May 23 in online format, will be the provision of Ukraine with the necessary weapons to defend its territories. ""To be honest, we have high expectations. I would call it a long-awaited process. We are grateful for the great military support provided by various states. We expect a positive result on the supply of MLRS. I have no secrets, we appeal to all countries - from the United States to every European country - regarding MLRS, thanks to which Ukraine will be able to take over the initiative and liberate its territory,"" said the President, answering questions from media representatives following talks with Prime Minister of Portugal António Costa in Kyiv. To those countries that are afraid to provide Ukraine with MLRS because they believe that our state will attack Russia, Volodymyr Zelenskyy reminded that the war is currently underway on Ukrainian territory, and Donbas has not ceased to be part of Ukraine after Russian passports were issued there. ""These are our territories, and we are going step by step to liberate them. We cannot pay the price of tens, hundreds of thousands of people. So we ask you to help us. In some countries it is just stored (this weaponry - ed.), and for us it is survival, I mean these MLRS,"" the Head of State stressed. According to him, the Ukrainian side knows that the Russian Federation at various levels threatens certain states, trying to prevent the transfer of these systems to Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on the countries not to be afraid and to unite, because that is what Russia is really afraid of. ""It is afraid of a strong union, that the EU and the United States will act as one organism. This is very important for us as well, because Ukraine is a fist in this single organism today. That is why we really need your material help,” the Head of State concluded."
Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with the Prime Minister of Portugal in Kyiv,2022-05-21T15:53:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Prime Minister of the Portuguese Republic António Costa, who is on a visit to our country. The Head of State noted that this was the first visit of the Portuguese Prime Minister to Ukraine. He called it symbolic that António Costa visited our country on Europe Day, because today the Ukrainian people are defending the independence and freedom that are common to all Europeans. ""Today, during the meeting, I once again felt such a closeness of values ​​and a common understanding by our nations of the future of Europe. Portugal has been helping Ukraine since the first days of Russia's full-scale invasion of our land. I am grateful to your country and to you personally, Mr. Prime Minister, for your defensive, political and humanitarian assistance, as well as for the great support for our citizens, forcibly displaced Ukrainians who fled the war and are now on the European continent in various countries, in particular in Portugal,"" said the President, addressing António Costa during a joint meeting with media representatives following the talks in Kyiv. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also praised Portugal's readiness to provide financial assistance to Ukraine. ""Relevant agreements on the provision of financial assistance by Portugal today will be formalized at the governmental level,"" the President said. In addition, according to him, a wide range of important issues related to the defense of Ukraine was discussed during the meeting, including further defense assistance. Attention was also paid to the issue of prosecuting Russian war criminals. ""We agreed to further increase the sanctions pressure on the aggressor. The key issue now is the sixth package of sanctions against Russia, which must include an embargo on Russian oil, oil blends and petroleum products. We appreciate Portugal's understanding that Russia is using all this to put pressure on Ukraine and a united Europe,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The interlocutors also discussed Ukraine's European integration. ""We hope that the state vote of Portugal will be in support of our country on the status of a candidate for accession to the European Union during the consideration of this issue at the European Council in June,"" said the President. Special attention was paid to the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy expects Portugal to be actively involved in this process. For his part, António Costa reaffirmed readiness to join the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war. He noted that his country could be responsible for rebuilding schools and kindergartens that were destroyed during hostilities. According to António Costa, Portugal has significant experience in designing and building educational institutions, which it will be able to use in Ukraine. The Prime Minister of the Portuguese Republic noted the resistance of the Ukrainian people to the barbaric and completely illegal invasion of Russia and the example of courage that Ukrainians have shown to the world. He noted the closeness of the people of Ukraine and Portugal, in particular due to the great contribution of the Ukrainian community to the development of the Portuguese economy in recent decades. António Costa assured Ukraine of his country's support in winning the war and establishing peace throughout Europe. The Portuguese Prime Minister also said that his country is looking forward to the European Commission's report on the prospects of Ukraine's integration with the European Union and is ready to share its own experience of gaining EU membership. António Costa spoke in favor of international sanctions and increased investment in alternative energy sources and ways to supply energy to Europe to overcome dependence on Russia."
"Before the war, the allies recommended that we dig trenches, and we told them: give weapons - President of Ukraine",2022-05-21T12:19:00Z,"A full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine could not be repulsed at once because the enemy was advancing simultaneously from several directions and used a large amount of manpower. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an interview with the host of the United News telethon. The Head of State noted that Ukraine was preparing for a full-scale Russian aggression, but no one knew the methods and scope of this invasion until the end. ""It's one thing when you realize that tanks will go from Belarus. And another thing is that Russia will go to Ukraine through Belarus, another thing is that missiles are flying from Belarus. It seems that the difference is small. There were warnings that there could be an offensive from that side. But the difference is big: you are at war with the forces and means that are on the territory of Belarus, which pass through the territory of Belarus and go to Ukraine, or you are at war with two countries,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The President stressed that Ukraine was preparing for various scenarios of invasion, and our state had sufficient information about the intentions of the enemy. ""In terms of the volume of forces used by the Russian Federation, which used everything, even the reserve, ""quiet"" mobilization... Concentration was in Crimea, in Belarus and in other areas… Along the borders, they concentrated a large number of forces a year before. I think that today no European country would be able to cope with such a volume,"" the President said. He noted that according to analysts, our state could not cope with the full-scale invasion of Russia, at least because Ukraine is 28 times smaller in area and still quite large territorially. ""When you are attacked by a large army, you cannot concentrate your forces around, for example, Kyiv. You need to look and provide air defense, tanks, equipment, infantry fighting vehicles, and most importantly - professional military personnel (throughout the country - ed.),"" said the President. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that in order to protect such a territory, the army should have not 250,000 of servicemen, but much more. The Head of State reminded that at the beginning of the year he signed a decree to increase the number of personnel of the Armed Forces by 100,000 servicemen. ""But even 100,000 plus could not stop them (the aggressor's troops - ed.). Today we have 700,000. You see the result of the work of 700,000 people who are at war,"" the President said. In addition, according to the President, at the beginning of the invasion, the enemy struck at the positions of the Ukrainian artillery and air defense forces. At the same time, as Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted, Ukraine was well prepared for the invasion, and there were many things that the enemy did not know about and that later worked against him. The Head of State is convinced that now Ukraine must quickly provide its army with modern weapons that will protect the entire territory. ""NATO countries have the appropriate weapons - there are Patriots, there is powerful air defense equipment that can protect the sky from missile strikes,"" he said. The President stated that the Armed Forces of Ukraine should move from Soviet technology to the latest models of weapons used by NATO countries. ""But it's a lot of money not only for re-equipment. We need to move from Soviet weapons to NATO models. And if you are a country that is not a member of NATO, how can you do that if you are not given licenses, you are not sold anything, as it was before the war,"" said the President. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that some partners recommended that Ukraine dig trenches before the war. ""By digging trenches, it is impossible to do what we did. Because it is impossible to win a war with a shovel. They told us to dig trenches. And we told them: give us weapons,"" the Head of State said."
"Victory can be achieved only in battle, and fixing the end of the war will still be diplomatic - Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-05-21T11:27:00Z,"Ukraine can win the war with Russia only on the battlefield, but the final dot will still be put at the negotiating table, because that is the only way to settle many difficult issues. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an interview with the host of the United News telethon. The Head of State noted that even today he can repeat the words he said three years ago after his election as President of Ukraine: we did not start this war, but we have to end it. However, the meaning of these words has changed. ""I really thought that the war could end with dialogue. But, unfortunately, I thought that this was a dialogue with the appropriate timing, that it would be possible to find answers to many questions and many decisions with the Russian side. I really thought so. And now it is a hybrid. That is why the war is so difficult. And the victory will be very difficult. It will be bloody, it will be in battle, but the end will definitely be in diplomacy,"" the President explained. At the same time, Volodymyr Zelenskyy is convinced that the end of the war will still lie in the diplomatic sphere, because there are a number of issues that can be resolved only at the negotiating table. ""We want everything back. And the Russian Federation doesn't want to return anything. That's why the ending will be at the negotiating table,"" he said. The Head of State also noted that the specific purpose and agenda of his future meeting with the Russian President, which is inevitable for registration of the end of the war, will depend on the moment when it will take place. ""Everything changes. There is a hybrid war, honestly, there will be a hybrid peace as well. And hybrid meetings. For example, if we met today, the issue of Mariupol would also be on the agenda. If we meet in two or three months, maybe this issue will not be on the agenda, or maybe it will. We don't know,"" he said. At the same time, the President of Ukraine stressed that in any case the issues of the end of the war and the establishment of peace, deoccupation of Ukrainian territories, exchange and return home of Ukrainian military and civilians should be resolved at the negotiating table. ""A lot depends on us, but a lot depends on Russia, too. Without talking to them, we must then state the result we have. We want the territories back and this war to be over. But how and when it will happen depends on the time when the conversation with Putin will take place. I think that the conversation between Ukraine and Russia will definitely take place. But we don't know in what format: with or without intermediaries, in a wide circle or in the format of bilateral conversation,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said."
We urge the partner states to recognize that Russia must be held financially responsible for the crimes it committed - address by the President of Ukraine,2022-05-20T22:25:00Z,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! But also our partners in the world. Today my appeal is broader than usual. And this address is dedicated to the subject on which we will work together in the near future. Namely, compensation for all the losses that Russia has inflicted on Ukraine through its aggression. Please take a look at how this day has passed. Missile strike of the Russian army at the Kharkiv region. In the town of Lozova, the occupiers destroyed a house of culture. Of course, Russia has already done everything possible to ensure that there is no place left for culture on its territory. But what does our Kharkiv region have to do with it? Let them undermine what is left of their houses of culture in Russia, if they want to. The invaders also hit the Odesa region, Poltava region, Zhytomyr region. Attempts to attack Donbas continue. They completely ruined Rubizhne, Volnovakha, just as Mariupol. They are trying to do the same with Severodonetsk and many other cities. They do everything to erode any normal life in the Kherson region, in those areas of the Zaporizhzhia region where they entered. All this and much more that the Russian army has done since February 24 and since 2014 needs a fair response. First of all, liberation. We must fight until we clear our land of the occupiers and guarantee Ukraine's security. Secondly, it is the prosecution of all Russian war criminals. In the Ukrainian courts, in the international tribunal and just on the battlefield while the war continues. But, thirdly, we are working to ensure that Russia compensates in one way or another for everything it has destroyed in Ukraine. Every burned house. Every ruined school, ruined hospital. Each blown up house of culture and infrastructure facility. Every destroyed enterprise. Every shut down business, every hryvnia lost by people, enterprises, communities and the state. Russian money as compensation should reach every affected person, family, business. Of course, the Russian state will not even recognize that it is an aggressor. But its recognition is not required. We urge our partner countries to legally recognize that Russia must be held financially responsible for the crimes it committed. This is important not only in the context of this war waged by Russia. But also in the context of any other aggressive actions, whether by Russia or any other potential aggressor. Evil must get a retribution and know that it will be punished. Therefore, we invite the partner countries to sign a multilateral agreement and create a mechanism through which each and every one who has suffered from Russia's actions will be able to receive compensation for all losses. Under such an agreement, Russian funds and property under the jurisdiction of partner countries must be seized or frozen, and then confiscated and directed to a specially created fund from which all victims of Russian aggression can receive appropriate compensation. That would be fair. And Russia will feel the true weight of every missile, every bomb, every projectile it has fired at us. We invite our partners to become the founders of such a fund, as well as members of a special international commission that will consider lawsuits, i.e. appeals from both individuals and legal entities. It is clear that this task will not be easy. But in fact, the debate has begun about the need for such compensation at the cost of Russian assets. The world is already talking about it. So we have to do it. And we are starting such a special dialogue with our partners. To make the aggressor feel that the war is capable of inflicting maximum damage not on anyone else, but on the one who went with it to a neighbor. The world has seen that existing international organizations and instruments cannot cope with all the challenges. Therefore, it is necessary not only to use the opportunities that already exist, but also to offer new ones. It will be effective. I also spoke today about Russia's responsibility for this war with representatives of Ireland who visited Ukraine. The Chairpersons of both Houses of the Irish Parliament were in the capital. We had very meaningful talks with them. And one more thing. Today I definitely want to thank our people who do not stop fighting the occupation. And especially those who are now in the territory that is temporarily under the control of Russia, its army. In particular, the rescuers in Enerhodar who protested today deserve support from all of us. Thank you. Each and every one must show that the occupiers have no right to decide anything on our land. This is an important component of our victory. Another decree on awarding our defenders was signed today. 202 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. In total, during the full-scale war, more than 14,000 of our defenders have already been awarded for bravery and efficiency in defending the country and helping our people. Eternal glory to all who stood up for the state! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine! And definitely the last one. Today is three years since I became President of Ukraine. Thank you for your trust. I am proud to be the President. Love you! I will not let you down! Glory to Ukraine!"
Speech by Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak at the Atlantic Council think tank,2022-05-20T17:27:00Z,"Ladies and Gentlemen Thank you for having the time for this very important meeting for me. I would like to start my speech today with a short video - a documentary footage of the prehistory of current events in Ukraine, what is happening now, and where we are going. Recently, it has become very popular to look for analogies to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the events surrounding this war. Historical parallels are always inaccurate. This is rather ""yes, but…"" than ""exactly so"". But they allow us to imagine a possible future in the light of past experience. Well, we are very pleased that the world has gone the path from the ""second Munich"" to the ""second Lend-Lease"" and the second frontline - this time the sanctions one - in a matter of months. However, today the attempts to turn today's Ukraine, which successfully opposes one of the world's largest armies, into the second Czechoslovakia look very strange. All this time we are emphasizing, and I will emphasize this again: it will not work. We will never give up. More than anyone in the world, we seek peace. But fair peace is crucial for us. Peace at any cost is not an option for us. We did not start this war. We did not seize foreign territories. But we have to return and will return ours. Ukraine is Kherson, Donetsk, Luhansk and Sevastopol. Our sovereignty and territorial integrity are not a compromise for us. This approach did not work in 1938, and now it will not work even more so. Russia's political culture does not provide for a regime of dialogue. Its basis, as we all see, is terror, blackmail and coercion. And the language of power. Therefore, there is only one way to prevent the war in Ukraine from escalating into a war in the region and even a world war: to help Ukraine win. And as soon as possible. First of all, weapons. I would like to take this opportunity to thank President Biden, both parties and the people of the United States for their military assistance. For unprecedented historical support and an inspiring example for others. America has reaffirmed its leadership in the free world by uniting democracies to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine. We truly thank you for the Lend-Lease. Your weaponry saves thousands of lives today, every minute, every second. Not just our soldiers, but also civilians. Because for Russian terrorists who call themselves military, civilians are also perfectly legitimate goals. Just as infrastructure facilities. This means that any weapon for Ukraine is a defensive weapon. Our allies in America, Europe and elsewhere are well aware of this. But I must also tell you that we still lack heavy weapons. We still need high-precision missiles, we need drones, air defense systems, ammunition and much more. And very importantly, we are still waiting for the MLRS. I learned this word, like many Ukrainians, for life. We are still waiting for them. That should not be the case. In the first, critical stage of the war, we spent too much time negotiating supplies, searching for these weapons. Meanwhile, people stopped tanks with bare hands in our cities. Now that we have a chance to completely liberate Ukraine from the aggressor, it is inadmissible to delay. We have very different potentials with Russia. Therefore, the liberation war of Ukraine, the war for freedom, should not turn into a war until the last Ukrainian. After all, it will not end there. If successful, the Kremlin's circle of historical reconstruction will continue to build its empire. Ukraine stands between it and the free world. It protects not only itself. Not only democratic values. It protects the way of life common to the West. Because, despite the hopes of short-sighted politicians, it will not be preserved. It will vanish if we do not win. Then voters will start asking them awkward questions. In particular, about betrayed heroes. However, we do not care about their possible answers now. We need weapons. Without limits. Immediately. I would like to repeat once again: we are very, very grateful for the Lend-Lease. But I will allow myself a baseball term: this is the first base. We are not just set up for a home run. According to Wikipedia, our big goal is a grand slam. We need to move on. All bases must be reached. So, the second thing I would like to talk about is the increase in sanctions pressure. To motivate Russia to stop the war, it is necessary to deprive it of resources - financial, technical, technological. More aggressive financial and energy sanctions are needed. In March, the President initiated the creation of a special sanctions group. And after talking to our friend, friend of Ukraine Michael McFaul, we decided to create this group. I am happy that the Atlantic Council has joined this group as well. We have assembled a team of international and Ukrainian experts. Michael and I are co-chairs of this group, so it is often referred to as the Yermak-McFaul group. It is working on assessing and improving sanctions mechanisms. Today we can already talk about certain results of this group's work. We have already published two detailed documents on what sanctions are needed and how to implement them. These documents are in fact guides to sanctions policy. Due to lack of time, I will list only the key areas. I must emphasize at once that the United States, the European Union and other democracies have done a lot here. But most of the work is still ahead. The Kremlin will be influenced only by a total ban and embargo on Russian energy. As it is both a key source of power for Russia's imperial ambitions and a geopolitical weapon. We warned about this, by the way, at the beginning of the Nord Stream 2 project. Unfortunately, not everyone heard us then. The current situation provides a unique chance to overthrow Moscow's energy dictatorship in the short term. In other words, the restructuring of Europe's energy consumption today is what we believe is self-defense and investment in its development. In particular, green energy. Energy freedom and energy democracy seem to us to be the key to the future. Full blocking sanctions are also needed against all Russian banks, starting with the largest. Payments for gas in rubles are categorically unacceptable. Sanctions should include disconnection from payment systems, freezing of assets and their subsequent confiscation. All sanctions must be coordinated and synchronized. To achieve maximum effectiveness, secondary sanctions mechanisms against states, businesses and individuals that help Russia circumvent them are essential. This is where the United States can play a crucial role. We move to the third base. Economic assistance to Ukraine. We are without exaggeration astonished by yesterday's Senate decision on an additional 40 billion for Ukraine and are infinitely grateful for the strong support provided earlier. We also hope for the facilitation in the post-war reconstruction of our country as soon as possible. Obviously, we will need comprehensive resuscitation tools like the Marshall Plan. The opening of the markets of our allies and partners for Ukrainian goods would give impetus to the further recovery of our economy. Post-war Ukraine, and we do not just believe, we are sure, will be a huge construction site, a field for innovation and investment. This is a chance to build a global showcase for the success of the community of democracies. At the infrastructural, technological, and, of course, value levels. After all, the crisis always opens up opportunities. Ukraine enjoys an unprecedented credit of confidence. We paid very dearly for it - human life. Thousands of human lives. But thanks to this the world saw that the contradiction between the politics of values ​​and realpolitik can be overcome. Those who support Ukraine today are making a value-based choice, but that choice will pay dividends. Today, even Hollywood and Silicon Valley are familiar with such things. And they are with us - at the call of the heart and with a view to the future. It is an organic union of freedom and entrepreneurship. Because Ukraine today is a frontier. The land of brave and sincere people. President Zelenskyy, our fighters and the entire Ukrainian people prove it every day. At the same time, justice is when the aggressor pays for the restoration. And pays as much as possible. Therefore, the issue of reparations and compensation is extremely important for us. We need a legitimate international mechanism that will compensate for the losses caused by Russia and operate despite its categorical refusal to cooperate. By the decree of President of Ukraine Zelenskyy, a profile working group has already been established, which I have the honor to chair. Ukrainian and international experts, including Markian Kluczkowski, Jeremy Sharp, Amal Clooney and many others, are working on a project of such a mechanism, and we will soon present it officially. Home base. Restored must be preserved. Ukraine will remain an outpost of democracy in Europe. Literally. So we need security. We need security guarantees. This war must be Russia's last. And if Moscow is openly claiming that it is at war with the West in Ukraine, the West should make every effort to ensure the victory of Ukraine. So that Ukraine fully restores its territorial integrity and sovereignty, and Russia does not try to take revenge. It should be clearly understood that when we talk about security guarantees for ourselves, we are not asking. We offer to invest in our common future. What do we see as these guarantees? The war taught us to believe only in facts. And here they are. We live among the wreckage of a world order. Russia's presence in the UN Security Council paralyzes the organization's activities. The OSCE has lost its meaning of existence. NATO is the only institution today capable of providing a reliable security umbrella to its members. However, its doors are open to everyone except Ukraine. In such circumstances, we are forced to look for other options. After all, our goal is to deter Russia from new aggression. It can be a treaty or a system of treaties that will oblige the parties to prevent it. We intend to establish an international expert discussion to develop approaches to solving this problem. I think there are experts present who are ready to join this platform. So we will be glad if you come forward and let us know. Unfortunately, the sad experience of the Budapest Memorandum has convinced us of one thing: any agreement between Ukraine and the guarantor states must be legally binding and duly ratified by the parliaments of these countries. Obviously, we do not see Russia among the guarantors, as it has based its policy on terror and systematic violations of basic norms of international law. Ukraine has proven its resilience on the battlefield, so providing maximum opportunities for self-defense should be one of the cornerstones of this treaty. No security guarantees from third parties can completely replace Ukraine's strong defense potential. So we expect the guarantor states to help in this. In particular, with the removal of all politically motivated restrictions on the supply of conventional weapons to Ukraine, as well as the deepening of military-technical integration and defense cooperation. Due to the long-standing decision of Europeans not to irritate the Kremlin, Ukraine is not a member of NATO. But it can strengthen the defense capabilities of the Alliance's Black Sea and Baltic fronts. This is a good offer, we think. In general, Ukraine's deep involvement in multilateral formats that improve its integration with the international community is a significant security factor. Therefore, we will not accept alternatives to EU accession, which have recently been put forward again. A lasting and flexible sanctions policy as a safeguard against revanchism must also remain one of the key factors in the security guarantees system. We consider this set of measures to be basic. It could become a testing ground, and the basis for the creation of a global coalition of responsible states that will be ready to respond effectively to any aggression within 24 hours. I would like to recall that President Zelenskyy proposed such a format of cooperation in March. We call it U24, United24. At the global level, this security system can start building a new architecture of international relations, reforming institutions and restoring the Westphalian principles of equality and respect for sovereignty. Here, the United States could also play a leading role in the process, once again creating a new model of global leadership. Finally, I will return to the not-so-precise historical parallels that are often made today. In 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait under the slogans ""one people"" and ""response to preparations for aggression."" You all know well how it ended. Here it can be said without objections. This is not about history. It's about the future. I thank you all very much. And availing myself of this opportunity, I would like to thank you on behalf of all Ukrainians for supporting us, for working and contributing, I am sure, to the Ukrainian victory that will take place soon. Victory not only of Ukraine, but our common victory."
President met with the Chairpersons of both Houses of the Irish Parliament,2022-05-20T16:06:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Chairperson of the Upper House of the Irish Parliament Mark Daly and Chairperson of the Lower House of the Irish Parliament Seán Ó Fearghaíl. Stressing the importance of visiting Kyiv at this crucial time for us, the Head of State said: “I am grateful to the leadership of Ireland, both to you and to the Parliament for the strong support of Ukraine, our people at this difficult time. For the support of our struggle for freedom, our territorial integrity."" During the meeting, Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted the importance of increasing coordinated, unified pressure on the aggressor by Ukraine's international partners. The key to this is now the introduction of the sixth package of EU sanctions against Russia. ""It is important for us that Europe remains united. This is the real strength and endurance. We demonstrated this to the world when our people united against Russian aggression. The unification of Europe is also important not only in support of Ukraine, but also in the steps of the offensive against Russia, first of all in the policy of sanctions,"" the President said. The President stressed that our country feels the support of Ireland for our accession to the European Union. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted the importance of making all relevant decisions that the Ukrainian people expect and deserve as soon as possible. The Head of State and the chairs of the Irish Parliament also discussed the prospects for post-war reconstruction of Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy informed about the relevant planned work, which is already underway, and invited Ireland to join the implementation of future projects in the framework of the reconstruction of our country."
Together we must ensure that Russia does not have any success in the aggression against Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-05-19T23:51:00Z,"Unbreakable people of the bravest country! All our defenders! Today, the 85th day of our defense, will be remembered for sure. I am grateful to the United States for approving a new $ 40 billion package of support for Ukraine and democracy in our region. Today, this package was passed by the US Senate. It is a manifestation of strong leadership and a necessary contribution to our common defense of freedom. A meeting of finance ministers, heads of G7 central banks and representatives of international donors also took place in Germany. I always say frankly: the monthly budget deficit in Ukraine now is $ 5 billion. And to endure the war for freedom, we need quick and sufficient financial support. And it's not just expenditures or a gift from partners. This is their contribution to their own security. Because the defense of Ukraine also means their defense from new wars and crises that Russia may provoke. If it succeeds in the war against Ukraine. That is why we must all work together to ensure that there is no success for Russia in its aggression against our state. Neither military, nor economic, nor any other. I spoke today with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. I personally thanked her for the macro-financial assistance in the amount of 9 billion euros, this package was proposed the day before. I also spoke with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. On economic issues, in particular on the export of our agricultural products and fuel imports. And also about the situation in the areas of hostilities and the evacuation of our heroes from Azovstal. I am doing my best to keep the most influential international forces informed and, as much as possible, involved in rescuing our military. I addressed students of Ukrainian universities. And it was a special address. I hope it will be heard not only by students. Because now is the time when we have the opportunity to build the future for Ukraine that we really want. Our future, Ukrainian future. Without any obsolete and toxic things that have nothing to do with our national needs and our character. Ukraine has become the master of its own life and must decide for itself how to live. In total, students of 25 Ukrainian universities took part in today's meeting. Geography is quite wide: Kyiv, Bila Tserkva, Mariupol, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Lviv, Kryvyi Rih, Donetsk, Kherson, Ivano-Frankivsk, Horlivka, Dnipro. Not all universities operate in their cities. Some of them moved. But what was nice and right - students and rectors are confident that Ukraine will win and restore free life throughout the territory. Important current issues were also discussed. Firstly, I instructed the Minister of Education to prepare changes that will allow applicants from all temporarily occupied territories to enter Ukrainian universities under a simplified procedure. Secondly, I instructed the Minister to decide how to ensure the education of those students who study under contract, but come from the currently occupied territories. Obviously, it is extremely difficult to pay for a contract to study in such conditions. The state must help. Therefore, I expect relevant decisions from the Minister, the Government and, if necessary, the people's deputies. We talked with students about post-war reconstruction and how to guarantee the security of our state for decades to come. The Armed Forces of Ukraine continue the liberation of the Kharkiv region. But in Donbas, the occupiers are trying to increase pressure. There's hell, and that's not an exaggeration. The brutal and absolutely pointless bombing of Severodonetsk... 12 dead and dozens wounded in just one day. The bombing and shelling of other cities, the air and missile strikes of the Russian army - all this is not just hostilities during the war. Russian strikes at the Chernihiv region, in particular the terrible strike at Desna, debris clearance continues, many dead; constant strikes at the Odesa region, at the cities of central Ukraine, Donbas is completely destroyed - all this doesn't and cannot have any military explanation for Russia. This is a deliberate and criminal attempt to kill as many Ukrainians as possible. Destroy as many houses, social facilities and enterprises as possible. This is what will be qualified as the genocide of the Ukrainian people and for which the occupiers will definitely be brought to justice. The first trial in Ukraine against a Russian war criminal has already begun. And it will end with the full restoration of justice within the international tribunal. I'm sure of it. We will find and bring to justice all those who give and carry out criminal orders. Today I signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 210 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 48 of them posthumously. The title of Hero of Ukraine was posthumously awarded to Captain Serhiy Parkhomenko, commander of the aviation unit of the 299th tactical aviation brigade. Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to everyone who is fighting for independence! Glory to Ukraine!"
"President offers to extend the simplified procedure for admission to higher education institutions to graduates from all territories of Ukraine, which are currently temporarily occupied",2022-05-19T22:13:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that entrants from all territories of our state, which are currently under the temporary occupation of the Russian Federation, should be able to enter Ukrainian universities under a simplified procedure. He said this during an online meeting with students and rectors of Ukrainian higher education institutions. The President reminded that in 2020 a simplified mechanism for admission to Ukrainian universities for graduates from the temporarily occupied territories of the Donetsk, Luhansk regions and the Autonomous Republic of Crimea was introduced. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, entrants from the temporarily occupied territories of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions should have the same opportunities. ""The issue of the list of temporarily occupied territories needs to be worked out. I will instruct to prepare the necessary decisions,"" the President stressed. In addition, responding to the students' appeals, the Head of State instructed Minister of Education and Science Serhiy Shkarlet to develop a mechanism for resolving the issue of payment under contracts for students from the temporarily occupied territories. ""Today we recognize the Kherson region as a temporarily occupied territory. That's why I don't understand why a student from the Kherson region has to pay money,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The Head of State offered to develop a solution that would help remove this urgent problem for students from the temporarily occupied districts of the Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv regions and Donbas. The President also noted that he likes the motto ""Education despite the war"" and called on Ukrainian students to continue their studies, despite hostilities, because Ukraine needs smart, educated, professional people. ""Students must continue to acquire knowledge. I wish you to take all the knowledge you can. This is also a very important work for the benefit of our state. We need clever people who understand their profession. People who can really revive Ukraine, production, technology,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy summed up."
Speech by Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak at the Chatham House think tank,2022-05-19T21:26:00Z,"“Don't ever take a fence down until you know the reason it was put up,” advises Gilbert Keith Chesterton in the book ""The Thing"". That is, not understanding the reasons for the current state of affairs can lead to wrong actions that will worsen this state of affairs. You are aware of our current state. Ukraine is successfully resisting one of the world's largest armies. Much longer than the world expected. It is important to understand clearly that no concessions could stop the Russian invasion other than unconditional surrender, a renunciation of national identity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. Actual consent to colonial status. Russia's political culture does not provide for a regime of dialogue. Its basis is dictation. The language of power. And Russia gained strength in cooperation with the West. What its military-industrial complex is not able to make - and that's a lot - Russia bought. Mostly for money from the export of raw materials. First of all, energy. And even after Moscow clearly demonstrated its imperial ambitions. In Georgia. In Ukraine. In Syria. Again in Ukraine. Oil went to the West. The money went to Russia. Business as usual continued. This must end. The current war must be Russia's last. It must end with the full restoration of Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty. That is our victory. Our common victory with the civilized world. After all, today Ukraine is defending not only itself. Ukraine today is Thermopylae of Europe. Helping Ukraine is a way to resolve the contradiction between policy of values and realpolitik. It is not just a matter of moral choice, it is also an investment in European and world security. So let me paraphrase Chesterton's statement: do not avoid participation in putting up the fence when you know why it is needed. And you know. It should consist of four parts. The first is weapons for Ukraine. The second is the continuation and intensification of sanctions pressure. The third is the establishment of reparation mechanisms and economic assistance. The fourth is building a reliable system of guarantees. So, about these points.  The first is weapons. We still need it. We are very grateful to our allies for supplying it. We believe in the sincerity of your intention to fulfill your commitments. I must say that we still lack heavy weapons. We still don't have MLRS. I learned this word, like many Ukrainians, for life. This equipment can save the lives of our people. Not just the military. After all, for the Russians, the civilians of Ukraine are also legitimate goals. As well as civil infrastructure. That's why wasting time is too expensive for us - in every sense. The occupation and shelling of nuclear power plants by Russian troops and blackmail by nuclear strikes pose a threat of global catastrophe. The inability to exploit almost a third of our sown areas, the systematic destruction of Ukrainian agricultural and transport infrastructure by Russian troops, and the blockade of our seaports are elements of Russia's overall strategy to put pressure on the international community. The threat of a food crisis and the risk of famine in dozens of countries, as the UN leadership warns, are absolutely real today. Our goal is to establish peace as soon as possible. The longer this war lasts, the greater the risks to the entire planet. But this peace must be fair. Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity is not a subject for compromise. Russia must liberate our territories, including the Ukrainian Crimea and the Ukrainian Donbas. As you can see today, the Russian offensive is bogged down, they are moving to the defense, trying to retain the occupied territories and create the conditions for another agreement, which they will still violate soon. As was the case with the two Minsk agreements. This is unacceptable for us. We can't give the aggressor a chance to devour Europe piece by piece again. That is why the second point is very important here, namely sanctions. Of course, they do not have such an immediate and direct impact on hostilities as the supply of weapons. But they can limit Russia's ability to pursue aggressive policies. They are able to deprive it of the finances, technology and materials needed to restore military capabilities. Therefore, they must be long-term. Effective punishment of Russia will also deter other potential aggressors. The five existing sanctions packages are clearly not enough. To this end, in late March, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy took the initiative to create a ""sanctions"" group. After that, I invited my friend and friend of Ukraine, Michael McFaul, to gather leading international and Ukrainian experts who would promptly assess the work of sanctions and increase their effectiveness. This experience has already been very successful, and perhaps a similar format should be introduced in Europe. We are ready for this. In April, our team presented an Action Plan to strengthen sanctions against Russia. Among the main goals are, firstly, a complete embargo on Russian energy, paralysis of the entire banking sector and access to financial markets. Due consideration should also be given to coordinating partner actions and secondary sanctions against states and companies that help the aggressor circumvent restrictions. At the same time, it is important to conduct thorough investigations to neutralize Russia's corrupt influence in Europe, America and other parts of the world. Recognition of Russia as a sponsor of terrorism is also very important. This is a very powerful and very important step. As you know, the Seimas of Lithuania has already done that. And the US Senate has also already registered a resolution. These actions should serve as an example for other states. On May 9, our team presented a Roadmap - a step-by-step strategy with detailed recommendations for the European Union on the implementation of energy sanctions. This is extremely important. After all, since February 24, the European Union has paid $ 800 million a day for imports of Russian oil and gas. I emphasize that with this money the EU indirectly financed the Russian aggression against our country. We have seen such facilitation before. In particular, during the attempt to implement the Nord Stream 2 project. You remember that we warned that Russia is considering and will consider such projects as geopolitical weapons. Warned about the inevitability of energy blackmail. But they didn't want to hear us until it was too late. Now we want to be heard immediately. We offer partners to use a unique opportunity to get rid of dependence on Russian energy in a short time. Destroy the energy dictatorship. And deprive Russia of geopolitical weapons. In other words, restructuring Europe's energy consumption model today is self-defense and investing in its development and future. Energy freedom and energy democracy are the key to the future. We therefore welcome the European Commission's decision to impose a total ban on Russian oil imports. We welcome the determination of those governments that are implementing the energy embargo. Our Roadmap provides recommendations for reducing shocks for European economies. This includes regulated import tax (or tariff) and storage of funds for energy on a special escrow account. We also welcome a similar initiative by the US government to impose tariffs on Russian oil by the European Union. Especially since the funds from the payment of duties may go to the Fund for Reconstruction of Ukraine. Here we reach another extremely important problem. And this is the third point - the creation of an effective mechanism to compensate Ukraine for the damage caused by Russian aggression. We need to resolve some issues as soon as possible. National courts and international arbitrations have no jurisdiction, the European Court of Human Rights cannot enforce its decisions, and the UN is almost paralyzed by Russia's presence in the Security Council. Sources of compensation can be the already mentioned special taxes and duties on Russian energy and transactions, as well as public and private property. However, Russia's foreign assets are protected by sovereign immunity, and the rights of oligarchs are protected by the inviolability of private property. And this is despite the fact that Russia itself ignores international law, and the capital of Putin's so-called wallets is mostly of criminal origin. Therefore, we need a legitimate international mechanism that will compensate for the losses caused by Russia and will operate despite its categorical refusal to cooperate. The Presidential Decree has already established a profile working group, which I have the honor to chair. Ukrainian and international experts, in particular Markian Kluczkowski, Jeremy Sharp, Amal Clooney and many others, are working on a draft of such a mechanism, and it will be presented soon. We consider reparations agreements as an element of Ukraine's post-war reconstruction. Among such measures, we also expect the regime of maximum admission of Ukrainian goods to the markets of our allies and partners, the launch of the so-called Marshall Plan for Ukraine. The case of Ukraine's reconstruction can be a success story for the whole of Europe, as it will be a huge construction and investment platform that can give impetus to the development of European economies. A number of countries are already taking care of the restoration of our regions. For example, Denmark has taken patronage over the Mykolaiv region, Great Britain is ready to be engaged in the Kyiv region. This format should be extended to other regions. Ukraine can become a global showcase for the success of the community of democracies, absorbing all the best both in terms of infrastructure, technology and values. After all, the crisis opens up opportunities. But these assets need reliable protection. That is, we move on to the fourth point. The war taught us to believe only in facts. And here they are. The current system of international relations has been destroyed by Russia's efforts. Every day of war is a stress test for global structures. In particular, the issue of rescuing people from Mariupol is a very hot topic today. This is the biggest test for both the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations in 70 years. I must note that the United Nations and personally Secretary-General, Mr. Guterres, with whom I am in constant contact several times a day, is now taking a very active part in the humanitarian mission in Mariupol. However, this is about the consequences of aggression, and I would like to talk about preventing it. NATO is the only institution today capable of providing a reliable security umbrella to its members. However - I must say this - because of the national selfishness of a number of states, it continues the policy of double standards. The Alliance, maintaining the illusion of open doors for Ukraine, opens them widely to other countries. In such circumstances, we are forced to look for other options. Look for them together with our partners. What will be the main security contours of Ukraine itself? I would like to emphasize here that we do not consider an alternative to membership in the European Union. We consider any proposals for its ""substitutes"" that we have heard recently unacceptable by definition. For us, integration into the European Union is not only a way to modernize, reform the state and increase GDP, but also one of the factors in ensuring our security. If you take to the streets of Warsaw or Vilnius, or Prague, or Paris, or Vienna, or any European capital, ask ordinary passers-by which country could protect them from Russia in the event of an attack. I am sure that many of them will name our country, Ukraine. Name a country that is not currently a member of NATO, not a member of the European Union. Today, after this war, we are definitely able to strengthen these organizations. We can definitely become a valuable asset for them. And ordinary people in Europe and the world today understand this. Isn't it time for politicians to listen to the opinion of their voters? We have an extremely negative experience of the Budapest Memorandum. We see attempts by some major powers to reconcile Ukraine with Russia on the Kremlin’s terms. In this situation, we have to insist that future security guarantees are legally binding and ratified by all participants. Obviously, we do not see Russia among the guarantors, as it systematically denies the fundamental principle of international law Pacta sunt servanda (""Treaties must be fulfilled""). It is inadmissible to even discuss the possibility of saving the face of the aggressor state and the terrorist state. Our dead and injured will not allow us to do that. The common goal of Ukraine and the guarantor states should be to deter Russia from aggression in the future. First of all, it means ensuring Ukraine's defense capabilities. We have shown the whole world that we are capable of resisting the forces of the enemy that are at times superior. But in the future, we hope that the guarantors will remove all politically motivated restrictions on the supply of conventional weapons to Ukraine and will help quickly restore and maintain its defense capabilities at the appropriate level. Especially during the reconstruction of Ukrainian industry. Another key factor in the security guarantee system must remain a long and flexible sanctions policy. This set of security measures could become a kind of testing ground in the future - the basis for creating a global coalition of responsible states that will be ready to respond effectively to any aggression within 24 hours. Let me remind you that our President Volodymyr Zelenskyy proposed such a format of cooperation back in March. We call it U24, United24. To build this system, we will have to modernize international law. First of all, expand the definition of aggression to include the tools of modern hybrid warfare in it. Basic international organizations need to be reformed. Common sense tells us that no country can be a member of the UN as long as it behaves like a terrorist and an aggressor. It must lose all rights in the UN and other organizations on the first day of the aggression. In the long run, the U24 security system should become global. After all, our world is becoming more integrated. And if someone because of size, wealth or ambition believes that he has the right to reject the rules of civilized coexistence… Well. Apparently, it is exactly about them Robert Frost said: ""Good fences make good neighbors."" Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much for your support. And keep in mind that our victory, which, I am sure, will happen soon, will be our common victory. And Ukrainians will never forget all the efforts of our friends and partners. Because today this war for freedom is not only Ukrainian. It is global."
President of Ukraine: I am proud that Ukrainian is fashionable in the world,2022-05-19T20:55:00Z,"The values that the Ukrainian people defend in the fight against the aggressor are the national idea around which our country and the whole world are united. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during an online meeting with students and rectors of Ukrainian higher education institutions. “Sometimes we look for a national idea… Each of us can have our own national idea. But look at the common values we defend - this is the national idea. Independence, our Ukraine,"" the Head of State said. According to him, the Ukrainian people have united, defending important things from the enemy: our Ukrainianness, our children, our culture. ""We are all united now. We understand exactly who we are, how we are different from our neighbors, who are fighting for what. We are the same. An equally beautiful country. And we are all united. Finally, our people are united. Unfortunately, for such a bloody reason, but finally it happened - the unification of the people, the state, society, mentality, ideas, the unification of the present, and therefore there will be the unification of the future. This is wonderful,"" the President stressed. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukrainians not only united themselves, but also united other countries around them. And interest in Ukraine is now felt all over the world - both among politicians and ordinary citizens: people want to come to Ukraine and look at our heroic people. And this is a change in the world's mentality, the Head of State is convinced. ""We could not believe that we were such a nation. We are a great Ukrainian nation. Both Europe and the United States are shocked and doubt whether they could do so or not,"" he said. ""I am proud that Ukrainian is fashionable in the world. This sounds very cool. Ukraine is number one in the world today. I am proud of everything that belongs to the history of Ukraine, starting with the language and our traditions,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. According to him, Ukrainians deserve such recognition of the world and such an attitude, although now they are going through perhaps the most difficult and very bloody stage. However, the President expressed his firm conviction that this war will end, Ukrainian cities will be unblocked, our army will be rearmed, modern air defense will be created so that the security situation allows our country to live and develop despite some neighbors. The President also stressed that Ukraine needs young people and expressed hope that after the end of the war, Ukrainians who went abroad will return. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that today he is glad to see energy and confidence in Ukrainian students. ""Confidence is what has united our people and given strength to our army. And it helped the Armed Forces of Ukraine to become twice as big thanks to the confidence of our people,"" the Head of State said."
"Thanks to the post-war reconstruction plan, state-of-the-art universities will appear in Ukraine - Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-05-19T20:11:00Z,"Ukraine's post-victory reconstruction plan will make it possible to build a new and modern European country, including educational infrastructure. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during an online meeting with students and rectors of Ukrainian higher education institutions. The video conference included broadcasts from Dnipro, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kryvyi Rih, Lviv, Odesa, Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Kyiv, during which students could ask the President their questions. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the plan to rebuild the country is a global program worth hundreds of billions of dollars, which will involve many countries. ""This is a big program, when every country in the world, our partners and friends will have patronage over a particular region or over a particular industry in our country. We will rebuild our country - modern, technological. This also applies to the field of education - we will completely restore the educational infrastructure. We will do everything for this. State-of-the-art universities will appear in our country,"" the President stressed, adding that the whole of Ukraine will have a different look. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the country's reconstruction plan will include the reconstruction of all infrastructure, including roads, bridges, medical and educational facilities, construction of temporary and permanent housing for people who have lost their homes and internally displaced persons, reconstruction of factories and strategic enterprises that have been destroyed or partially damaged. He assured that after the deoccupation of Ukrainian territories, students and lecturers will be able to return to their native universities. At the same time, the President noted that the state of infrastructure in the occupied territories, in particular in Mariupol, Berdyansk, Melitopol, etc., is still unknown. ""Mariupol is the heart that has been hit by many Russian bullets. The heart will definitely beat. We will definitely rebuild Mariupol - modern, completely new, technological. We will all be proud of it and remember the tragedy that happened to people. We will definitely remember the price at which the city of Mariupol was rebuilt and liberated,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. The Head of State also noted that the destroyed university in Kharkiv will be restored. ""We will build a strong country together. It's not just about the buildings, it's about who we are, what children you will raise and what kind of education they will get in such wonderful universities. And how they will treat our state,"" the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that the whole cities will need reconstruction, so there will be enough work for everyone. ""It will really be at the level of a great national idea - to build the most powerful, most modern state. Of course, at our own expense, at the expense of our budget, we would never be able to do that. But today I personally and our team are working to unite not only the finances and specialists of other countries, but also to unite them with our specialists, students. This will be a new stage for the state,"" he said."
Address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to students and rectors of higher educational institutions of Ukraine,2022-05-19T20:03:00Z,"I am really glad to have the opportunity to talk to you today and I hope that this will be exactly communication. Not a lecture or seminar, which I'm sure you already have enough. I would like to build a dialogue with you, so in my speech I will ask questions, and I am interested to hear each and everyone who would like to answer.  So when you ask your questions, please choose one or several of my questions and give your answer. Let's start. This is a very special time for our country. Millions of our people are now fighting for the right to life and freedom for our people. And it really opens up a space of possibilities. Right now it is our country that is in a situation where we can choose the future for it as we decide. That is, it is not just an adaptation to the conditions created for Ukraine by other generations or even other states. As it is for other countries, and as it was for our state before the war. We can consciously reshape our lives. Here is what is possible now. These are great opportunities, this is the time to determine which Ukraine you want to live in. So my first question to you today is about this: what should our state be like? And this question logically continues with a number of related questions. Do you want to live in Ukraine? Do you expect changes from Ukraine to live here? Or, on the contrary, you believe that our country already has everything for you to live here. Let's move on. There are many countries in the world that are talking about reforms. Even the most developed ones always have it. The words ""the system is not working and needs to be fixed."" This is a common narrative for many politicians. But in few countries, as in ours now, there are opportunities not just to ""fix"" the existing system, but to create a new one. Based on what is best. Not only here, now. But also in those countries where it would be worth taking the best. Of course, this war put an end to many things from the life of Ukraine before. But not to all. For example, our people who have gone abroad while the hostilities are going on say that certain things in our lives are much more progressive than in other countries. Digitization, which we started doing in the public sphere. Internet and communication, which are very accessible due to business. The service sector, in which speed and willingness to work is often greater than in many European countries. It turned out so. We must also not forget that even during a full-scale war, our institutions did not break down. Banking sphere works. The budget system and public administration have endured. Defense and logistics are ensured despite the fact that the enemy in some respects has more forces and equipment. That is, society has a certain foundation, and it would be unwise not to use it. But we must understand that Russia will always be there. And it may always be a threat. After February 24, we have already achieved a lot. And now, for example, you can see how the world evaluates our potential in a fundamentally different way. Perhaps you have seen how two Forbes articles are compared, very interestingly: the headline of February 12 - will Russia invade Ukraine; and the headline of May 16 - will Ukraine's army invade Russia. That is, the world began to look differently at the situation in our region and the balance of power. But it is important what we think about ourselves. What our people feel about our state. So, my next question to you: what should Ukraine be like so that you can be sure that we can protect ourselves from any threat? This question also continues with a number of others. For example, a professional contract army or with the addition of a certain form of conscription? How big should the army be? What share of public expenditures should we spend on defense? The biggest or not? And even in the conditions of the future peace? Should private military companies be allowed? Should there be a universal military obligation in Ukraine for all boys and girls, as is the case, for example, in Israel, so that all our people can defend themselves when needed? And should all citizens or a significant part, as is the case in other states, be involved in military training every year? Suppose, while maintaining the salary and job at the time of the training. Are you ready to personally defend Ukraine with weapons in hands? Or do you think it is fair that someone else will fight on the battlefield? These questions of mine are not rhetorical. We really need answers. And it's not just something purely functional. About state governance or politics. It's about how our people can understand each other and how to stay in Ukraine, because this is our home. Your home. How not to quarrel in it and live developing common interests. For example, people often remain in the rear, but demand from those on the frontline to drive the occupiers all the way to Kuban. It is often the case that a person in the military sphere does not go beyond photographs in camouflage, but at the same time behaves as if he can lead the troops better than anyone else. What is your attitude to such people, for example, in politics? Or in the media? Anyone, it doesn't matter. And how should their personal emotions and ambitions relate to reality, to real war? Does a non-combatant have the right to demand something from warriors? Demand meeting some of your requirements and expectations? Is that fair? You probably see that this war can end for Ukraine with certain security guarantees. And in this regard, I have the following question for you: Which countries do you see among the possible guarantors of security for Ukraine? Should we choose those we trust? Or should we focus on everyone who is strong enough? Security guarantees for Ukraine are a really good opportunity to create a tool for decades that will allow us to live in peace. Although it will not allow us to be careless about security. All the same, we will always think about defense. And we must understand that there is no better security than the willingness of citizens to defend their own state. Because it is the protection of oneself first of all - one's family, one's home, one's land, one's way of life. This is the state - all this. So, if any of you are not personally ready to defend the state - well, tell me why? Perhaps you see your other contribution to the common national security, which is really special? Maybe it's something in the field of cybersecurity. You may want to join some form of volunteering. Perhaps, as future businessmen or scientists - you see for yourself some other option, the third, fourth, fifth.   So, my next question to you: Should the state regulate at its discretion who to involve in defense and how, or leave people the choice during the war? Of course, I have my answers to these questions. But Ukraine differs from Russia and other tyrannies with the fact that not one person decides everything for the whole nation, but people can choose the rules of life for themselves. So, the next block of questions. Given that Russia will remain our neighbor, we need to consider the format of security inside Ukraine. The key question is about weapons. Is there a need for the order of possession of firearms by ordinary people that, say, we see in the United States? Or, as in Switzerland, in a society of ""citizens with weapons"" who can quickly join the defense of their country, and where, for example, a former soldier can keep at home the weapons with which he served. What should be the weapons system? Should it be allowed to carry it openly? Should it be limited to the right to own and keep it at home? Should the rules be the same for all regions of the country or should more liberal ones be provided for those regions where there is a greater threat of invasion? Do you know how to use weapons? How should the border with Russia work after this war? Should it be completely closed or open? In other words, how do you see coexistence with the Russian Federation and its citizens after the war? Could there be what they call the word ""relationship"" between us and them? Or should it be deliberately restricted, even if it occurs at some level? Let's move on. It’s been a long time since I was a student and that's understandable. And I think more about which universities my children will study at. Which Ukrainian universities. This is very important. Maybe my daughter, who will soon be 18, will be in an auditorium one of you is currently studying in. But I remember well when I was a student. And I remember that many people of my generation felt a certain loss of time. Years in auditoria, years of lectures... It seemed to many and, I'm sure, now someone thinks for sure that 5 or 6 years at university is a long time. Probably, if it is a medical specialty, it takes 7 years and a lifetime to study, taking into account all the nuances. But if it is some other specialty, does it always take 5 years? Perhaps 2, 3, 4 are enough for some, given how the modern economy works and how quickly technology is transformed. What do you think about it? And what economic life are you preparing for? Do you anticipate that you will have to change professions during your life? Several times. Or what professions, in your opinion, will always exist and will not be replaced by artificial intelligence and robotics? Maybe it is worth increasing the share of private business in the education system? What do you think about private universities, what do you think about private schools, private education? Can your university's curriculum compete with the curricula and courses currently offered in a variety of formats outside of universities? Don't you feel like you're wasting your time? Because now in the world, even more than before, the main thing is speed. There is such a feeling. Speed in the ability to learn. In everything. At work, in the constant transformation that life demands of the individual. Modern life. I must have been talking for a long time already. Then the last question. Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine has been going on for three months already. After 8 years of war in Donbas. This war for us now is undoubtedly a war for independence. We can say that this is a postponed war. Postponed for 30 years, given how we gained independence in 1991. Or for hundreds of years, given the previous history of our great state. I have no doubt that we will gain independence. And it will be in our history the same as in other countries that fought for independence and won. Countries that ceased to be beggars and became subjects. The real masters of their lives and their future. But we must remember now and always that the price of all this is tens of thousands of lives. The lives of all those killed by the enemy. Tens of thousands. For independence. And for the opportunity for each of you to choose how to live and which Ukraine to live in. So, my question to you: Is it worth it? I really hope to hear the answer to this question."
"Russia is trying to find its ""wonder weapon"", which indicates the complete failure of the invasion and the fear of admitting catastrophic mistakes - address by the President of Ukraine",2022-05-18T23:42:00Z,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! Today, one of the representatives of the Russian state said that the occupiers allegedly began to use laser weapons systems in Ukraine. Allegedly to save missiles. Firstly, it is noteworthy that they need to save missiles and somehow explain it. That is, more than two thousand missiles fired by the Russian army at Ukraine were the main part of their stockpile of missiles. That is, only the remnants are left. Secondly, everyone has already seen Russia at war. Inexperienced conscripts, which it throws into battle like cannon fodder. Marauders who see normal appliances for the first time in a foreign country. Old Soviet ""armor"" without modern protection. Forbidden phosphorous bombs, which they use to burn schools and ordinary houses. And missiles, most of which were spent by the Russian army on the destruction of absolutely civilian infrastructure without any strategic military outcome. Today they hit missiles in such a way at Mykolaiv and Dnipro. Well, in the propaganda of Nazi Germany there was such a term ""wunderwaffe"". Wonder weapon. The clearer it became they had no chance in the war, the more propaganda there was about the wonder weapon, which would be so powerful that it would provide a turning point in the war. And here we see that in the third month of a full-scale war, Russia is trying to find its ""wunderwaffe"". Allegedly laser. All this clearly indicates the complete failure of the invasion. But again, this also shows that they are afraid to admit that catastrophic mistakes have been made at the highest state and military levels in Russia. Therefore, they will come up with more and more ""wunderwaffe"" as the Armed Forces of Ukraine and all our defenders liberate our land step by step. How long will it take? The answer to this question can only be given by the real situation on the battlefield. We are trying to do it as soon as possible. That's for sure. We are obliged to drive out the occupiers and guarantee Ukraine real security. That is why I signed decrees on the extension of the legal regime of martial law and the term of general mobilization. I hope that the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine will support this decision in the near future. Our army and all those who defend the state must have all the legal tools to act steadily. Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Enerhodar, Mariupol and all of our cities and communities that are under occupation - under temporary occupation - should know that Ukraine will return. I said today in my address on the occasion of the Day of Remembrance of the Victims of the Deportation of the Crimean Tatar People that our state does not leave anyone behind and returns what belongs to Ukraine by right. We remember Crimea. And we will never forget 1944 - the genocide of Crimean Tatars committed by the Soviet authorities. And 2014 - the second wave of destruction of everything free on the Crimean peninsula. Especially on this day I signed the law on the protection of persons deprived of liberty by the occupiers, as well as on the protection of family members of such people. We are talking about all the Kremlin prisoners - both in Crimea and in the occupied part of Donbas. The law gives them more protection and assistance from the state. We are also accumulating all possible resources of the world to support Ukraine. I am grateful to Andriy Shevchenko, our legendary football player, for becoming the first ambassador of the new national brand of Ukraine - United24. The state needs this platform right now, which allows, in particular, to raise funds to support Ukraine. Anyone in the world - in one click - can contribute to our victory. And in the direction he or she considers most important. For example, defense and demining, medical care or rebuilding the country. And in early June we will be able to see the first special event in London with the participation of Andriy Shevchenko in support of United24. I thanked President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen for the package of aid to our country announced today. Its amount is 9 billion euros. And also for supporting the plans for restoration of Ukraine. This step by the European Commission is a testament to the true leadership that the European Union is capable of. And it will definitely help us in the struggle for our common freedom. I spoke with the new President of the United Arab Emirates. Congratulated him on his election and invited to take part in the post-war reconstruction of the state. We discussed the threat to global food security that Russia had provoked by the invasion. And traditionally in the evening I signed the decree on awarding our heroes. 197 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 5 of them - posthumously. Also today I had the honor to present the Order of the Golden Star to servicemen who were previously awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. In particular, to Colonel Serhiy Baranovsky for courage and efficiency in the battles in Donbas. And to Colonel Serhiy Musienko for personal courage and success in the battles in the Kharkiv region. Eternal glory to the defenders of Ukraine! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for our independence and freedom. Glory to Ukraine!"
"Ukraine must get everything it needs to win, because prolonging the war is a risk for the whole world - Andriy Yermak on MSNBC",2022-05-18T22:52:00Z,"The Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak emphasizes that Russia's aggressive war against our country may end sooner if the Ukrainian army receives the weapons on which negotiations are underway and there are agreements with partner countries. Prolonging the war is a risk for the whole world, he said on the American television channel MSNBC. Andriy Yermak noted that now the Ukrainian military is succeeding on the frontline, for example in the Kharkiv region. At the same time, very heavy fighting continues in Donbas, which is an unnecessary reminder of the horrors of this war. According to him, Ukrainians have already shown the world that they will fight for complete victory. ""And, of course, we are confident of our victory. And I am convinced that this will be a victory not only for Ukraine, but also for all our friends and partners,"" Andriy Yermak said. The Head of the Office of the President suggested that there are certain forces and people in the world who may be interested in making this war very long. ""But I can say that the longer this war lasts, the greater the risks for other countries, for the whole world that this war will affect not only Ukraine. At first, it will affect states that have borders with Russia, and then it may be a war involving even more countries,"" he said. Andriy Yermak noted that today the Ukrainian nation is showing how not to be afraid and fight. And if Ukraine receives in time everything that was agreed on with our partners and friends, it will win and will do it as soon as possible. In particular, the Head of the President's Office noted that Ukraine is waiting for the US Senate to approve a bill on the allocation of almost 40 billion US dollars in support of Ukraine and for President Joseph Biden to sign it. ""It's vitally important. And we are very grateful to the American people, President Biden and his administration, Congress, the Democratic and Republican parties, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and everyone who is involved and continues to support and help Ukraine,"" he said. Andriy Yermak reminded that a team of leading international and Ukrainian experts (Yermak-McFaul group) has developed an Action Plan to strengthen sanctions against Russia, and one of its key elements is a full embargo on Russian energy. He noted that everyone is currently watching the ongoing discussions and consultations in the European Union on the sixth package of sanctions against Russia, and expressed hope that this decision will be made. ""Because we see the reaction and position of societies in European countries that fully support my country and the struggle of Ukrainians. Because they understand that today Ukraine is defending not only itself, its independence and freedom, but also the freedom and independence of the whole world, especially Europe,"" the Head of the President's Office concluded."
Andriy Yermak talked online with American actor Robert De Niro and producer Jane Rosenthal,2022-05-18T22:36:00Z,"Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak spoke by video conference with renowned American film actor, director and producer Robert De Niro and producer Jane Rosenthal, co-founders of the Tribeca Film Festival, which emerged in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Andriy Yermak thanked the Hollywood legend for his support of Ukraine and his position on the terrible war waged against our state by the Russian Federation. ""When we are supported by people like you, it inspires, gives energy and strength,"" he said. The Head of the Office of the President stressed that today Ukraine is fighting not only for itself and its freedom, but also for the entire free democratic world. Jane Rosenthal noted that it is very difficult to observe what is happening in Ukraine. ""We are trying to do everything possible to help Ukrainians,"" she said. In particular, the producer offered to show the video address of President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the participants and guests of this year's Tribeca festival, which will take place on June 8-19. Andriy Yermak supported this idea. The Head of the Office of the President also invited Robert de Niro and Jane Rosenthal to consider joining support for the United24 project initiated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which should unite people from all over the world to help Ukraine. Andriy Yermak invited Robert De Niro to visit Ukraine at this crucial time, when the opportunity arises. The actor said he was looking forward to that opportunity."
The First Lady met with WHO Regional Director for Europe Hans Kluge,2022-05-18T18:24:00Z,"The First Lady of Ukraine Olena Zelenska met with WHO Regional Director for Europe Dr. Hans Kluge. The President's wife thanked the WHO for its support during the war, including assistance with equipment, machinery, medicines, and participation in the investigation of Russian war crimes against doctors and the destruction of institutions. She also told Hans Kluge about her national program to provide psychological assistance to victims of the war in Ukraine. ""You know about the physical injuries and deaths caused by Russia in Ukraine. We thought about how to heal more insidious and long-lasting psychological wounds. After all, we can say that the mental health of every Ukrainian is currently undermined: those who have directly experienced violence in the occupation, the loss of loved ones under shelling, those who are directly at war,"" said the First Lady. ""Mental problems are also experienced by those who simply live in a state of constant anxiety, uncertainty, who have lost their home and job. These are children and parents, the elderly, people with disabilities - each of them is experiencing the war tragically in their own way. The future of our country depends on how they will overcome this stress and shock, heal this deep wound, without exaggeration, it is a separate victory that we must achieve,"" Olena Zelenska added. She also asked WHO to provide expert assistance in setting up such a program. For his part, Hans Kluge promised to assist in this, as well as in organizing a meeting between Olena Zelenska and Queen Mathilde of Belgium, who is an active UN ambassador for mental health in the world and oversees several relevant funds. Olena Zelenska also suggested a theme for this year's World Mental Health Day, which is celebrated in October. Every year its theme changes according to the challenges of the time. The First Lady of Ukraine has taken the initiative to dedicate this year's date to mental health in wartime. ""The war in Ukraine has affected not only our state. It seems to me that the psychological consequences have been felt in Europe as well, ”she said."
"President supported the initiative to establish the national brand UNITED 24, the first ambassador of which is Andriy Shevchenko",2022-05-18T16:03:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed Decree № 344/2022 on the establishment of the national brand UNITED 24 and congratulated the first ambassador of this brand - the legendary Ukrainian football player and coach Andriy Shevchenko. In early May, the President initiated the launch of the UNITED 24 fundraising platform, which aims to increase charitable donations to support Ukraine in the world, including by joining efforts of international partners, donors, philanthropists to support our country in defending independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty, as well as in the postwar recovery. During the meeting at the President's Office, Volodymyr Zelenskyy congratulated the brand's first ambassador Andriy Shevchenko. “It is important that the first ambassador of the UNITED 24 brand is a Ukrainian who is known all over the world. Andriy enjoys great trust and authority, which he gained through his hard work and sporting achievements. Now he has a new mission - to tell the world about the events in Ukraine and direct his authority to increase international assistance to our country to bring our victory closer,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. For his part, Andriy Shevchenko noted that it is a great honor for him to become the first UNITED Ambassador 24. ""I have been representing Ukraine in the international football arena for many years.

"Along with the embargo on Russian oil, it is extremely important to stop its transportation by vessels under EU flags - Oleg Ustenko",2022-05-18T15:19:00Z,"Russia will be able to circumvent EU sanctions and continue to earn crucial cash from its oil sales. That is why Ukraine insists on a ban on transporting Russian oil by EU-flagged vessels. This was stated by Adviser to the President of Ukraine on Economic Issues Oleg Ustenko in a comment to Politico. The EU countries are now actively discussing the sixth sanctions package against Russia. In particular, they are negotiating whether it will envisage a prohibition for EU-flagged ships from transporting Russian oil to third countries. It is stated that this European Commission idea was shot down by Greece, Malta and Cyprus over concerns their shipowners would lose out to rivals and their economies would take a hit. Global Witness, a climate advocacy group, estimates that vessels owned or managed in Greece, Cyprus or Malta, or sailing under their flags, have picked up at least 150 million barrels of crude from Russian ports between February 24 and May 10. According to a Lloyd's List report, Greek shipowners actually stepped up their Russian oil deliveries in April: accounting for 76 out of 190 tankers shipping crude or oil out of key Russian ports compared with 30 out of 172 tankers in the same period last year. According to the publication, in 2021 Russia received 45% of budget revenues from oil and gas sales. Oleg Ustenko said Russia's oil exports are earning around $1 billion a day — making it crucial to stop shipments immediately. “You can imagine how many missiles and bombs they can buy in order to bomb our cities, to kill our citizens, to rape our women,” he said. “Politicians on the EU side are talking about money and we are talking here about lives,” Oleg Ustenko noted. Foreign vessels are vital to Russia's ability to ship oil. This should be blocked immediately, the President's adviser is convinced."
Address by the President of Ukraine on the occasion of the Day of Remembrance of the Victims of the Crimean Tatar Genocide,2022-05-18T13:52:00Z,"Dear citizens! All our great people! On this day last year, I said we would be back. Return to Crimea. Every year on May 18, Ukraine commemorates the victims of the genocide of the Crimean Tatar people. The people whom they wanted to deprive of their homeland. The people whom they wanted to deprive of their lives. The people whose history and whose name they wanted to erase. But the people who managed to return home. Managed to preserve themselves and the truth. On May 18, 1944, the Soviet authorities began the forced deportation of the indigenous people of Crimea, the Crimean Tatars, from their only homeland. After the terrible war that took place in Crimea, as well as throughout Ukraine, as well as throughout Europe, the whole people was then put on the brink of survival. During and after the deportation, when the Crimean Tatar people were forced to live abroad, almost half of the IDPs died. Almost half the people! It was a deliberate crime of tyranny against the people and against humanity as such. Today we turn again to what was experienced then. And we are doing this in conditions when the descendants of that tyranny are not only trying to deprive Crimean Tatars of their home for the second time - since 2014. They also want to take away the home of the entire multi-million Ukrainian people - all who live on our land. Significant territories are under the occupation of the Russian army. There are so-called filtration camps, through which hundreds of thousands of people pass. The occupiers are destroying our cities, our villages. They forced more than 12 million Ukrainian men and women to leave their home. And again, like 78 years ago, they are forcibly deporting hundreds of thousands of our people abroad to remote areas. Last year, on May 18, addressing the people, I recalled the lines of the Crimean Tatar poetess Lilya Budzhurova ""When we return"": When all our people return home / You will have to remember where we were born / You will have to remember where you yourself were born / Showed up as uninvited guests here. And this year, in the days of this war, we prove: Ukraine is really coming back. The truth is coming back. And people are coming back. A full-scale invasion of Russia, inspired by the worst the world has seen in the 1940s, raises from ashes the experience of that time. However, it encourages us to return these occupiers to what all anti-human regimes ultimately go through, namely, their defeat. The territory of the northern regions of our state has already been liberated. We are returning the Kharkiv region. Defenders of our state are repelling the most desperate efforts of the occupiers in Donbas. The Armed Forces of Ukraine simultaneously repel the attacks of Russian troops in the south. We defend Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv, Odesa. And we remember every city and every community that is still under occupation. I always emphasize: under temporary occupation. And, of course, we remember Crimea. The occupying forces have already suffered such defeats in Ukraine that Russia has not seen in various wars for decades. Poisoned by state propaganda, many Russians are simply unaware of this yet. They do not want to see how big their losses are - in different senses of the word. People, economy, culture, future. But life will make them feel these losses. In 1944, expelling the Crimean Tatars from their land, the then torturers were convinced that none of the displaced would return home, to Crimea. Now, trying to occupy Ukraine and destroy our lives, the current torturers of the people were also convinced that everything would work out for them and that we would not be able to endure it. And we endured. And we are struggling to bring life back to every corner of our home. And we are coming back. Today, on this very day, I am signing the law ""On Social and Legal Protection of Persons Deprived of Personal Freedom as a Result of Armed Aggression against Ukraine and Members of Their Families"" adopted by the Verkhovna Rada. This law is to protect all those ordinary peaceful, civilian people who have been repressed by the occupiers and who have been taken prisoner by them. This law is, in particular, for Nariman Dzhelyalov and many others who are deprived of their liberty by strangers in Crimea, in their native home. For those who are being held in prisons on the peninsula and who have been deported to Russia. This law is for the relatives and friends of all prisoners of the Kremlin - in Donetsk, Luhansk, in all those areas, and in Crimea. For all who have been tormented by the enemy. This is help and protection. And we will definitely restore justice. Qırım serbest olacaq! Eternal memory to all victims of the genocide of the Crimean Tatar people!"
Missile shelling of a number of regions and subversive activity at the border are an attempt of the Russian army to compensate for a series of failures in the east and south of Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-05-18T00:24:00Z,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! The 83rd day of our defense began with a rather powerful combination of Russian strikes at Ukraine. Missile shelling of the Lviv region, Sumy region, Chernihiv region. Air strikes in the Luhansk region. Specific sabotage activity in the border areas of Ukraine. All this is not just creating tension for our state, not just testing our strength. This is a kind of attempt of the Russian army to compensate for a series of failures in the east and south of our country. They cannot demonstrate success with general military action in the areas where they are trying to advance. So they are trying to show success through their missiles and other activities. To no avail as well. These strikes, like many previous ones, do not change anything radically. Especially since our air defense and anti-sabotage measures are becoming stronger. I had a conversation today with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Quite productive. First of all, about the defense support for Ukraine, about our cooperation at the EU level. I informed him about the current situation on the battlefield and the possible development of this situation. I had a conversation with President of France Emmanuel Macron. Substantive and long. We discussed the sixth package of sanctions being prepared in the European Union. We also discussed the negotiation process with Russia and evacuation of our heroes from Azovstal. The evacuation mission continues, it is overseen by our military and intelligence. The most influential international mediators are involved. We also spoke separately and substantively with the President of France about our European integration steps and the consideration of Ukraine's application for EU candidate status. I continue to gather the largest possible international audience for Ukraine. To support our state at all levels. And to put pressure on Russia at all levels. Information, diplomatic and cultural pressure is what we need. So that, as in the days of World War II, the struggle for freedom can rely in particular on the power of art. So today, during the opening ceremony of the Cannes Film Festival, I addressed the world filmmaking community. I reminded that now, as in the 1940s, it is necessary to boldly and openly defend freedom and fight the dictatorship. Right now is the time. When the language of cinematography can and should become the language of the struggle for freedom. Today I signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 165 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 13 of them posthumously. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to 3 servicemen of the 24th separate mechanized brigade. To those who showed extraordinary courage and efficiency in the battles in Donbas. Today I bid farewell to the first President of Ukraine Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk. The ceremony took place in Kyiv. In Kyiv, which will remain Ukrainian. The capital of an independent state. From 1991 and forever. Eternal glory to all who stood up for Ukraine! Eternal memory to everyone who fought for independence! Glory to Ukraine!"
"Today there is a war for freedom again, and again it is necessary for cinematography not to be dumb - address by the President of Ukraine to the filmmaking community at the opening of the 75th Cannes International Film Festival",2022-05-17T23:48:00Z,"It is a great honor for me to address you. Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends! I will tell you a story. Indeed, a lot of stories begin with the words ""I will tell you a story"". But in this one, the finale will be much more important than the beginning. And this will not be an open ending. Finally, it can put an end to a battle that has lasted more than a hundred years. This battle began with the arrival of the train. The hero and the antagonist came out of it. And so the confrontation on the screen was born, which turned into real life. First, cinematography appeared in our life, then it became our life. And then, what the future would be like depended on cinematography as well. My story today is about this battle. About the battle. And about the future. The worst dictators of the 20th century loved cinematography. It is known about them. But the most important thing left after them is the eerie documentary footage of the newsreel. As well as movies that challenged these dictators. The first festival was to begin on September 1, 1939 in Cannes. But World War II broke out. For six years, cinematography has been on the frontlines of this war, along with all mankind. For six years, cinematography has been fighting for freedom, and also, unfortunately, for the benefit of the dictatorship. Now, going back to that movie, we can see how freedom was moving towards victory. And in the end, it did not allow dictators to capture people's hearts. There were many important points along the way. However, the most outstanding was in 1940. When, in contrast to the antagonist, the world saw, at first glance, an inconspicuous guy who did not look like a hero at all. But he turned out to be so. ""The Great Dictator"" by Charlie Chaplin did not destroy the real dictator then. But thanks to it, cinematography ceased to be dumb. Dumb in every sense of the word. Cinematography spoke, and it was the voice of the future victory of freedom. Even then, in 1940. When the screens sounded: “The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish…” Since then - since those words of the hero played by Chaplin - mankind has produced many beautiful movies. It seemed that everyone already understood that one can conquer people with the beautiful, gathering them near the screens, and not with the ugly, gathering them in bomb shelters. It seemed that everyone already believed that the horror in the form of a full-scale war that could cover the entire continent would not have continuation. But again, as then, there is a dictator. Again, as then, there is a war for freedom. Again, as then, it is necessary for cinematography not to be dumb. On February 24, 2022, Russia launched a full-scale war against Ukraine. Planning to go further to Europe. And what kind of war is this? I want to answer this question as clearly as possible. Armed with the words that were said by cinematography in the years after the previous continental war.   You have already heard most of these words. They sound eerie. On the screen. But, unfortunately, this has become a reality. Remember that? Remember how it sounded in the movies? “You smell that? Napalm, son. Nothing else in the world smells like that. I love the smell of napalm in the morning…” Yes, it started in Ukraine in the morning. At four o'clock, when we heard the first missile explosions. When the air strikes began. And when death, going to Ukraine across the border, marked its equipment with the swastika analogue - the ""Z"" symbol. ""They all want to be better Nazis than Hitler..."" Now, there is not a single week passing without mass graves of killed and tortured people found in the territory where Russian troops were or still are. 229 children were killed as a result of the Russian invasion. “They can't get anywhere but kill, kill, kill! They have sown Europe with corpses…” You saw what the Russian military did in the small town of Bucha. You saw Mariupol. Saw Azovstal. Saw the theater blown up by a Russian bomb. By the way, it was similar to where you are now. Ordinary civilians were hiding there from the shelling. Two large and noticeable inscriptions ""Children"". They were on the asphalt near the theater. And we will never forget it, because it is not even Hell. “War isn't Hell. War is war, and Hell is Hell. And of the two, war is a lot worse…” More than 2,000 Russian missiles have already hit Ukraine. Dozens of cities were completely destroyed. Scorched villages. More than 500,000 Ukrainians have been deported to Russia by force. Tens of thousands are in Russian camps created on the model of Nazi camps. No one knows how many prisoners will survive there. But everyone knows who is to blame. “You think soap can wash you?” Unlikely. The worst war since World War II is already in Europe. First of all, because of one person who is in Moscow. Other people die every day. And they will not come to life after the phrase ""Stop, cut!"". But what do we hear about it now? Will the movie be silent or will it speak? If there is a dictator, if there is a war for freedom and if again, as then, everything depends on our unity, will cinematography remain outside this unity? Our cities are not destroyed by virtual graphics. Many Ukrainians have become Guido and are trying to explain to children why they have to hide in the basement. Many Ukrainians have become like Aldo Raine. The land of our country is already streaked with thousands of trenches. Of course, we will continue to fight. And we have no alternative but to fight for freedom. And I am sure that the dictator will lose. But words should sound like in 1940. Sound from all screens of the free world. We need a new Chaplin, who will prove again that cinematography is no longer dumb. Remember how it sounded then: “Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness… To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair… The hate of men will pass, and dictators die.” We must finally win this battle. And we need cinematography that will provide just such a finale. So that every voice is on the side of freedom. And, as it has always been seen, first of all the voice of cinematography. I thank you all! Glory to Ukraine!"
Ukraine enjoys the strong support of the Czech Republic as regards the prospect of EU membership - Ihor Zhovkva,2022-05-17T20:27:00Z,"Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Ihor Zhovkva is on a working visit to the Czech Republic scheduled for May 16-18. During a meeting with Prime Minister of the Czech Republic Petr Fiala on Tuesday, Ihor Zhovkva conveyed words of profound gratitude from President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the Czech government and the Czech people for their strong support in countering Russian military aggression. ""The Czech Republic is one of Ukraine's key European partners, which provides significant political and practical assistance to Ukraine and is one of the five key suppliers of weapons to our country,"" said Ihor Zhovkva. In the context of the reconstruction of Ukraine, the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic was invited to consider the possibility of patronage over one of the cities or regions of our country. During a meeting with President of the Senate of the Czech Parliament Miloš Vystrčil, ways to strengthen the parliamentary dimension of cooperation between the two countries were discussed. Ihor Zhovkva thanked for the uncompromising position of the Czech Parliament on Russian aggression, in particular for the recently approved Senate resolution in support of Ukraine, which recognizes Russia's actions as genocide of the Ukrainian people. The agenda of the meeting with Foreign Minister Jan Lipavský included the coordination of the efforts of Ukraine and the Czech Republic to overcome the challenges associated with full-scale Russian aggression against our state. In particular, the results of the meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council held the day before were discussed. The interlocutors agreed on the need to further strengthen sanctions against Russia and to impose a sixth package of sanctions as soon as possible, which must include an oil embargo. The Deputy Head of the President's Office thanked the Czech Republic and the Czech people for providing temporary shelter to more than 300,000 Ukrainians who were forced to leave their home due to the war, and for creating all necessary conditions for their comfortable stay. The key topic of Ihor Zhovkva's meeting with Minister of European Affairs Mikuláš Bek was to attract the support of the Czech Republic in the implementation of Ukraine's aspirations to become a member of the European Union. In this context, the Czech side's attention was drawn to the importance of the approval by EU member states of the decision to grant Ukraine the status of a candidate country for EU membership in the near future. Ihor Zhovkva called on the Czech side not only to support such a decision, but also to make efforts to persuade other EU states, which are still showing a more restrained position. Mikuláš Bek outlined the priorities of the Czech presidency of the EU Council in the second half of 2022 and presented some initiatives to consolidate the financial support for our country. Ihor Zhovkva thanked his interlocutor for the fact that Ukraine has a special place among these priorities of the presidency. ""We look forward to the active role of the future Czech presidency of the EU Council in supporting the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine. Despite all the challenges to the security of our country, despite Russia's military aggression and numerous casualties and destruction, Ukraine is confidently moving towards the dream of membership in the European Union. And on this path we are assisted by true friends, such as the Czech Republic,"" Ihor Zhovkva said. The key topics of the meeting with Head of the Foreign Department at the Office of the President of the Czech Republic Rudolf Jindrák were the priorities of the Czech presidency of the EU Council and the importance of coordinating the parties' efforts to combat Russian aggression. Ihor Zhovkva made special emphasis on the need to increase the sanctions pressure on the aggressor state. Meetings with representatives of the Czech and Ukrainian business circles are also planned during the visit. Possibilities of attracting business to the reconstruction of our state, as well as prospects for expanding trade and economic cooperation, which will be opened in the process of Ukraine's integration into the European Union, will be discussed."

Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive - this is our principle - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-05-17T00:17:00Z,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! The 82nd day of our defense is coming to an end. A difficult day. But this day, like all others, is aimed precisely at saving our country and our people. Regarding the situation in Mariupol. Thanks to the actions of the Ukrainian military - the Armed Forces of Ukraine, intelligence, the negotiating team, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations, we hope that we will be able to save the lives of our guys. Among them are the seriously wounded, they are being provided with medical aid. I want to emphasize: Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive. This is our principle. I think that every adequate person will understand these words. The operation to rescue the defenders of Mariupol was started by our military and intelligence officers. To bring the boys home, the work continues, and this work needs delicacy. And time. We also maintain maximum diplomatic activity in other areas in the interests of Ukraine. I spoke today with IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva. On how to speed up the provision of financial assistance to Ukraine, given the state budget deficit during the war, which is about $ 5 billion a month. We also talked about the main directions of further cooperation. On the eve of the meeting of the G7 finance ministers, these talks with the IMF Managing Director are a direct preparation for very important decisions for Ukraine. A high-ranking Polish delegation worked in Kyiv. Consultations with them were held regarding cooperation at the European Union level. In particular, it concerns the acceleration of our integration into the European Union and the expected decision on the candidate status for Ukraine. We are also working to ensure that the European Union agrees on a sixth package of sanctions on Russia. The oil embargo must be a part of it, and it is in the interests not only of our state, but also of the whole of Europe. I am grateful to those leaders of the continent who are aware of this and help promote the respective decision. I addressed the student community of the United States of America - representatives of leading universities. I also talked to the rectors and presidents of these educational institutions. The key issue is to involve American universities in rebuilding our education system after the war. In addition, we discussed political issues, including the protection of democracy, countering Russian propaganda and fakes. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are repelling constant attacks in those areas where Russia is still trying to advance. Severodonetsk and other cities in Donbas remain the main targets for the occupiers. We do everything to protect our land and our people. I signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 201 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Senior Lieutenant Ahasyiev Kyrylo Yashar oğlu - platoon commander of the 92nd separate mechanized brigade. And posthumously to Lieutenant Colonel Yerk Vyacheslav Volodymyrovych, commander of the aviation squadron of the 40th tactical aviation brigade. Eternal glory to everyone who stood up for our state! Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"

We still do not know how many Ukrainian children died in the occupied territories - President,2022-05-16T22:29:00Z,"Ukraine still does not know how many children were killed by the Russian enemy in the temporarily occupied territories and how many young Ukrainians were forcibly deported. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during an online meeting with the US university community. The Head of State noted that today almost 300 children are known to have died in the formerly occupied territories of Ukraine as a result of Russian shelling, bombing and torture. ""But (still - ed.) there are temporarily occupied territories. And we do not know how many people died there, how many victims and how many children died or are in critical condition. We will be able to understand this only after the deoccupation of certain territories,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. In addition, according to the President of Ukraine, about 500,000 people were forcibly deported from the temporarily occupied territories to Russia. ""Children and adults were separated. According to our data, children were sent to different families or to orphanages, boarding schools - where there are orphans, children without parents. That is why it is a tragedy for us. We do not know this number of children, we do not know the number of people, we do not know in what condition they are. It was a deportation by force. Documents were confiscated from them, from adults in the first place, passports were confiscated and exchanged for Russian ones,” the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed the need to investigate every case of forced deportation of Ukrainians. In addition, the President thanked all states that provide education to Ukrainian children from families of IDPs. ""It is very important not to lose the educational program, even if it is in another state. Education should continue in spite of everything,"" the Head of State said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also expressed hope that after the end of the war, many Ukrainian young people who left Ukraine due to hostilities will return home. ""Without science, without education, without students, there will be stagnation in the state. Even all the optimism after the victory will go nowhere, because without the strength of young people, without this energy, it is impossible to build anything,"" said the President."
Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on US academics to join the restoration of Ukrainian educational institutions affected by Russian aggression,2022-05-16T22:22:00Z,"During an online conversation with the US university community, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy invited academics to join a program to rebuild schools and universities in Ukraine, as Russia destroyed thousands of Ukrainian educational institutions during the full-scale invasion. According to the Head of State, a major plan for the reconstruction of Ukraine is being worked out, which will include, in particular, the reconstruction of schools, universities, institutes and other educational institutions. ""Thousands of educational institutions were destroyed. This is a great tragedy for us. Therefore, we will only be grateful to you if we have such projects for restoration at the level of ministries of education, at the level of educational programs, at the level of universities,"" said the President. ""When we talk about restoration, it is a question of not only money, but also specialists. Because we can build an institution, a university, but it is very important that there are people who are carriers of knowledge and specialists. That is why we are ready for such joint work and we will be very grateful if you help us develop new educational programs,"" he added. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that Ukraine's reconstruction plan envisages programs to rebuild various sectors of the economy and public life. ""We form partnerships with one or another institution, with one or another state. We even have patronage. We already have several such examples. I know that the United States, Canada, European countries will choose the appropriate region for the reconstruction of our country,"" said the President."
Address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy to American students during online communication with the US university community,2022-05-16T20:52:00Z,"Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear friends! I am grateful for this opportunity, I am grateful for the honor to address the students today, to answer your questions. Not all of you, however, look like students. You are already rectors, already heads of educational institutions, presidents. But as far as I understand, the student community hears us and it is very important that it sees us. This is really important. Because my speech is dedicated to them and then I will be ready for a dialogue. To them exactly, because the speech is about choice. This is the age when you have to make a choice. The main choice that everyone makes in one way or another in his life. Makes at this, I would say, golden age, student age. Or even earlier. When choosing the answer to the question of who he is. Who are you? What are you like? I will give you my example so that you can feel what I am talking about and what I wanted to tell you. Who am I? I am the President of Ukraine. I studied law. Then practiced in court. Then I became an artist, producer, businessman. And then I became a President - the President of our beautiful state. And each of these stages was supposedly a different life. But in fact, it's one life. This is the answer to the question of who you are in life. Are you a subject or are you just watching? Are you trying to change something or not? Are you worried - and that's all, or are you worried and trying to help, fix, do something? It is a choice that determines life. What you will be. What your country will be like. Each of you, students, even if you don't realize it, makes that choice. Every day. And then it becomes your character, it becomes your destiny. For example, each and every one of you in life has probably been in a situation where there is hatred next to you. When a person insults another person in word or deed. When another person is humiliated. When someone is trying to take something from another person. Are there many who will help in this situation? There are those who just watch. Someone will shoot a video with a smartphone, it is very popular now, and then post it on Instagram or YouTube. Someone may just laugh. And someone will still help. Stop the humiliation. Stop the hatred. Help a person feel dignity again. There are many situations when the word can mean salvation for a person. Who feels that life is not going in the right direction. Or when a mistake is made. Seemingly a terrible and fatal mistake. After which you may not want to live at all. We have all seen such situations in the movies. When a person may attempt suicide. And some have seen it in real life. And some have faced a choice - whether to try to help or not? Or just to walk by? Whether to shoot a video of what you see and then collect likes and shares on your social network? It is good that there are people who do not stay away. Those who take the situation into their own hands and help. I remember a terrible day for your nation and for the whole democratic world - 9/11. I then watched the attack on the ""twins"" on TV - with my friends. And some of them just couldn't believe what was happening. Some even said that this could only happen in America. And he was told very quickly that it could happen in any country, it could happen to anyone. Because terror knows no borders. I remembered how shortly before September 11 I was in New York, I was there - in the ""twins"". And I felt that it could happen when I was there. That I could be among thousands of people - either in the towers or next to them. And I would be faced with the same choice - how to escape? How to save others? Who to help? And could I be able to help myself? When one day you decide for yourself that you have to be the master of your life, then you always stay with that power and look for what to do. After the full-scale invasion of Russia, I heard a lot of advice. All of them came down to the fact that we have to accept that Ukraine has become a victim. Victim of the occupation of Russia. That there is almost no chance for resistance. That the Russian army will allegedly take down all our resistance very quickly - three or five days. And that it is supposedly better for me to just leave Ukraine, because no one will be able to stop Russia. I was offered help with transport instead of help with weapons! But it was just not about us. These were completely wrong proposals. They did not take into account who we are. Who I am. How we see life here in Ukraine. Our country will never be a victim again. It will not just be an observer of life - including its own life. We can, want to and will be subjects in life. We made this choice. This is my choice. And the choice of the vast majority of Ukrainian citizens. This is where our strength comes from, our strong desire for the freedom we are fighting for. And I am grateful to those who made that choice with us. Who also decided to be the subject of life and the struggle for principles, and they are the same for us - the struggle for freedom. There is case law in your country. If once - even a long time ago - a decision was made at the appropriate level by a proper court, similar cases are decided according to this precedent. This is always taken into account. The same is true, in fact, in international politics. What is Russia doing now? It is trying to set a precedent. If it manages to break the statehood of the neighboring nation, other states will do the same. What is Ukraine doing now with its partners? Trying to set another precedent. So that all the aggressors in the world once and for all see that the war will create the biggest problems for them - for the aggressors. So that they know that the hatred they spread against ordinary people like you and me, against other nations, will strike first and foremost at themselves when the free world refuses to deal with those who spread such hatred. This is a very transparent process of struggle. And everyone chooses a role in it. There are states that are trying to stay away. Be supposedly neutral. And not help fight for our common values. It's the same as in life, when help is needed, and there is only a crowd of people watching instead of helping. And there are states that contribute as much as possible to protect freedom. To stop the aggression. To guarantee the force of international law. It is this role that the United States has chosen, and I am very grateful to your people, to your leaders for that choice. After all, it is also the answer to who you want to be in life. Those who do not want to be just a victim or an indifferent observer. But those who can and do defend democracy, because that is how they protect themselves as well. Their freedom, their way of life, their people. Their worldview in which there should be no room for individual violence or brutal wars. Each of you right now - at this age and in the position you are in - chooses this for yourself. How do you respond to challenges? What do you do when you see injustice? And I really want you to choose this path for yourself. The path of clear awareness of who you are. The path of agency. Because if it is your choice, it will always be the choice of your country. Just as it is the choice of our country. Thank you very much! Glory to Ukraine!"

President and the IMF Managing Director discussed the support of Ukraine's economy during the war,2022-05-16T18:48:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a video conference with Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund Kristalina Georgieva on the eve of her participation in the meeting of the G7 finance ministers. The President thanked the IMF for supporting Ukraine's economy during the difficult times of the war. ""Thank you for being a leader in the issues of assistance and overcoming this situation,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Because of the war, not everything is yet possible. But we are ready to show the world that we are moving forward,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. For her part, the IMF Managing Director said she would inform the G7 about the need to speed up the provision of the necessary financial support."
We are doing everything to maintain the world's maximum attention to Ukraine and our needs - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-05-15T23:01:00Z,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! The 81st day of our defense is coming to an end and another week of round-the-clock work for Ukraine and victory is beginning. This week, as always, there will be a lot of international activity in which I will take part. The key is weapons and financial support for Ukraine. Finances not only to maintain stability now, but also to begin rebuilding what Russia has ruined. We are also working to strengthen sanctions on Russia. Partners need to make decisions that limit Russia's ties to the world every week. The occupiers must feel the rising cost of war for them, feel it constantly. Now the priority is the oil embargo. No matter how hard Moscow tries to disrupt this decision, the time of Europe's dependence on Russian energy resources is coming to an end. And that can't be changed. Another task, which becomes even more important the longer the war lasts, is to do everything to maintain the world's maximum attention to us, to Ukraine. Information about our needs should be in the news of all countries that are important to us constantly and every day. In particular, for this purpose - for greater information and political support of Ukraine - on Monday I will communicate with students of leading American universities. These are 63 US universities and two Canadian universities, which unite hundreds of thousands of students and are a large expert and research community. Their voice will definitely strengthen our capabilities. A separate address to Stanford University students is also planned for the end of May. I am also preparing to communicate with Ukrainian students from the leading universities of our country. In my address to them I will answer some important difficult questions that already exist in our society, which are already visible. And I expect profound questions from them, from our students. I will definitely continue to address the parliaments of Ukraine's European partner states. Our task is the status of a candidate for EU membership for Ukraine, and later - accession to the European Union under the fast-track procedure. Every state matters. Every vote counts. It is equally important to have the maximum consent of European countries in the issue of strengthening sanctions on Russia. That is why I will be addressing the Luxembourg Parliament in the near future. By the way, we are also working to expand the geography of such special speeches in the parliaments of Africa and Asia. An address to the participants of the Davos Forum is scheduled for May 23. This year the conference will be especially important for our country. Post-war reconstruction will be discussed. We are doing our best to fully gather the support of the world, and participation in the Davos Forum is one of the best opportunities for that. We continue very complicated and delicate negotiations to save our people from Mariupol, from Azovstal. We deal with this issue on a daily basis. And the main thing is for the agreements to be fulfilled. We expect the United States to adopt important decisions for our country. A new significant package of support and detailed elaboration of the renewed historical program of the Lend-Lease. We are preparing for new attempts by Russia to attack in Donbas, to somehow intensify its movement in the south of Ukraine. The occupiers still do not want to admit that they are in a dead end and their so-called ""special operation"" has already gone bankrupt. But the moment will surely come when the Ukrainian people will force the invaders to fully recognize reality. No matter how ""creative"" they are in Kherson and Melitopol, no matter how they portray their alleged ""power"" in the occupied areas of Pryazovia and Donbas, they are there temporarily. The Ukrainian flag, Ukrainian law, Ukrainian life will still be there anyway. Today's Russian missile strikes at the Lviv region, shelling of Hulyaipole, Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, cities and communities of the Donetsk region - all this brutality of the occupiers, which Ukraine is experiencing every day, will only lead to the fact that Russian surviving soldiers will bring this evil back to Russia. They will bring it back because they will retreat. This is how all the feverish activity of the Russian military we see now will end. And I am grateful to all the Ukrainians who are bringing this time closer. Eternal glory to all who defend the state! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
Support for Ukraine means working to prevent a global famine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-05-14T22:51:00Z,"Wise people of our bravest country! All our defenders! Last year, on May 14, the Day of Remembrance of Ukrainians who saved Jews during World War II was celebrated in our country for the first time. 2659 Ukrainian men and women received the title of Righteous Among the Nations. Our country is the fourth in the world in the number of the Righteous. People who risked their lives, the lives of their loved ones, but still saved those who were threatened with imminent death at the hands of the Nazis. Rescued children, adults, whole families. Each of these rescue stories is impressive. It strikes with courage, because there was total evil around, and people still kept good in their hearts. It strikes with belief that humanity will still win despite the then occupation and the power of the Nazis. The Righteous were in all regions of our state - from Zakarpattia to Crimea, from Odesa to Kharkiv. And we do not know all the stories of salvation. There were many who simply did not have time to tell thanks to whom their life was saved. They also rescued very young children who simply could not understand what was really happening to them. We must always remember that our people have such Righteous among them and that even in the darkest circumstances there are people who carry light. This is exactly the same striving for good that we see today in Ukrainian men and women who help save people from the occupiers, from the same Nazis. I am grateful to all journalists and just all caring people who document modern stories of salvation and record for all generations of our people what Ukraine has to go through and how people show their best qualities saving others - acquaintances and strangers, relatives, children, adults. I held talks today with a delegation of US senators led by Senate Republican Minority Leader Mitchell McConnell in Kyiv. I believe that this visit once again demonstrates the strength of bipartisan support for our state, the strength of ties between the Ukrainian and American nations. We discussed various areas of support for our state, including defensive and financial. As well as tightening sanctions on Russia. I expressed gratitude for the historic decision to renew the Lend Lease program. I called for the official recognition of Russia as a terrorist state. One of the issues I deal with on a daily basis is food security. More and more countries around the world are realizing that Russia, by blocking the Black Sea for us and continuing this war, puts dozens of other countries at risk of a price crisis in the food market and even famine. This is another incentive for our anti-war coalition to act more decisively together. Now support for Ukraine - and especially with weapons - means working to prevent global famine. The sooner we liberate our land and guarantee Ukraine's security, the sooner the normal state of the food market can be restored. The situation in Donbas remains very difficult. Russian troops are still trying to show at least some victory. On the 80th day of the full-scale invasion, it looks especially insane, but they do not stop all these efforts. I am grateful to everyone who holds the line and brings closer to Donbas, Pryazovia and Kherson the same thing that is happening now in the Kharkiv region. Step by step we are forcing the occupiers to leave our land. We will make them leave the Ukrainian sea as well. By the way, now in many cities and communities of Ukraine there are discussions about renaming streets and squares. My advice is to turn to the stories of the Ukrainian Righteous and perpetuate their memory. Because it is about the courage and humanity of Ukrainians who have already proved that the evil that comes to our land will inevitably lose. Eternal glory to all our defenders! Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
President met with a delegation of the US Senate,2022-05-14T15:12:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with a delegation of the upper house of the United States Congress headed by the leader of the Republican minority in the Senate Mitchell McConnell. The Head of State stressed that this important visit is a powerful signal of bipartisan support for Ukraine from the US Congress and the American people. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that today Ukraine is fighting against the Russian aggressor, defending not only its state, but also democratic values and freedoms, the right of nations to freely choose their own future. ""Russia is committing genocide against the Ukrainian people. Commits war crimes that terrify the whole world - torture, mass shootings, rape. ""Europe has not seen such crimes since World War II,"" he said. The President noted the special role of the United States in increasing sanctions pressure on Russia. In particular, he stressed the adoption by the United States Congress of laws banning the import of Russian oil and the suspension of trade relations with Russia and Belarus. Also, according to him, it is especially important to increase the sanctions pressure on the banking sector of the aggressor country. ""I look forward to the United States' support for further sanctions. In addition, we believe that Russia should be officially recognized as a state - sponsor of terrorism,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The President thanked the United States for its leadership in supporting Ukraine. The President called the entry into force of the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act a significant event for our country. After all, strengthening the defense and financial support of our state is extremely important for resisting Russia's armed aggression. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also expressed hope that the US Senate will promptly approve a package of additional funding to support the Ukrainian people, which has already been considered in the House of Representatives and increased from $ 33 billion up to $ 39.6 billion."
Ukraine does not have extra six months to wait for the EU oil embargo as Russia continues to kill our citizens - Oleg Ustenko,2022-05-14T12:53:00Z,"The European Union's embargo on Russian oil imports must take effect immediately, as Ukraine cannot wait another six months while Russia continues killing our citizens. This was stated by Adviser to the President of Ukraine Oleg Ustenko in an interview with the international media organization Project Syndicate. He noted that Ukraine commends the proposal of the European Commission to stop the import of Russian crude oil, but believes that postponing the implementation of this decision for six months is unacceptable. After all, the Russian Federation uses the revenues from the sale of energy to finance its military machine. “Russia is receiving $1 billion per day for its energy exports. You can imagine how many missiles, weapons, and bombs they can buy in the six months before the embargo is fully implemented. Our position is straightforward. We want this embargo to go into effect at once. We don't have an extra six months to wait while Russia continues to kill our citizens. Under the circumstances, we believe that Europe must act immediately,” the Adviser to the President emphasized. According to him, after the introduction of a full embargo on Russian oil in the short term, world oil prices will rise, which could cause losses for Europe. But in the medium term, prices will adjust, as oil producing countries will increase production not only in the Middle East, but also in Africa, and this should lower prices. “Second, the Chinese economy is slowing, which means it will consume less oil. That, too, will move markets toward a new equilibrium and reduce prices,” Oleg Ustenko said. In the long-term perspective, it would be a win-win situation for the whole world, because it is going to be more predictable, stable and secure. Hence, business income will grow. To mitigate the short-term negative effects of the embargo, the Adviser to the President of Ukraine proposes, for example, to limit the price of Russian oil for a transitional period. “The marginal cost of production for Russian oil is around $10 per barrel. Russia should be allowed to keep $10 per barrel sold, and any amount above that should be seized through sanctions. This money should go into a special fund for rebuilding Ukraine,” he said. As for natural gas, here, according to Oleg Ustenko, Europe can continue to buy Russian gas, but the proceeds should go into an escrow account, which is administered by a special board. “With the board’s approval, some of the funds could go to Russia for critical imports such as pharmaceuticals. This would leave Russia with some incentive to continue selling natural gas to Europe, even in the face of the new sanctions. And the board could approve greater disbursements to Russia if it withdraws from Ukraine and stops the war,” the Adviser to the President noted. According to him, this escrow account should be administered by a board formed by Ukraine's allies - the United States and the European Union or the European Commission. Our state must also be represented on the board. In addition, as Oleg Ustenko noted, along with tightening restrictions on oil and natural gas imports, the Ukrainian side would welcome the imposition of new sanctions on the individuals in power in Russia. “There have been some sanctions for top-level individuals, but not yet for their family members. All members of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s party, United Russia, should be cut off from Europe. They and their family members are still spending their time in Europe, rather than enduring life in Russia. They should be stopped from doing that, so that they have a greater incentive to put pressure on Putin to end the war,” the Adviser to the President emphasized. He also said that any trade with Russia must be stopped. Insurance companies must be prohibited from providing coverage for ships departing from Russian ports, and all Russian banks must be excluded from the international payment system."
The European Union and NATO will not be strong today without Ukraine - Andriy Yermak,2022-05-14T08:36:00Z,"Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak emphasizes that today Ukraine needs the unity of Europe in supporting our country, in particular on its path to membership in the European Union, and imposing more effective sanctions on Russia, especially the oil embargo. He said this during an online conversation with representatives of the European Policy Centre. Andriy Yermak reminded that on the initiative of President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy he had gathered leading international experts (Yermak-McFaul group) to work out recommendations on effective long-term sanctions on Russia. They have developed an Action Plan to strengthen sanctions. Its main point is a complete embargo on Russian energy - the main source of funding for the Russian army. On May 9, the expert group presented a Roadmap, a step-by-step strategy with detailed recommendations for the EU on energy sanctions, which contains clear proposals to minimize Russia's oil revenues during the transition period and ensure a managed phased embargo on Russian gas imports. The Head of the President's Office stressed that Ukraine and the Yermak-McFaul group commend the European Commission's decision to impose a total ban on Russian oil imports. He noted that Europe should be united in the issue of the oil embargo. According to Andriy Yermak, the Ukrainian authorities are constantly in contact with European partners, the EU leadership, and all proposals of the Ukrainian side are taken into account, and their effect will be seen in the results. The Head of the President's Office is also convinced that both a strong sanctions policy and Ukraine's accession to the EU are a matter of mutual security - for our country and the whole of Europe, although not all European capitals are aware of this. ""For us, the proposal on “alternatives to European integration” is unacceptable. We believe that it creates the same illusion of an open door as in the case of NATO,"" he said. According to Andriy Yermak, Ukraine today deserves special unprecedented mechanisms for EU membership. The Head of the President's Office believes that in June our country must receive the status of a candidate for EU membership, because otherwise it will be an extremely negative and incorrect signal. ""Today, our country, being neither a member of NATO nor a member of the EU, has been repelling one of the world's most powerful armies for so many days. And today, the European Union and NATO must finally understand that as much as Ukraine needs the EU and NATO, so much does NATO and the EU need Ukraine. I believe that without Ukraine today, neither the European Union nor NATO will be strong,"" he said. Andriy Yermak is convinced that Ukraine will become one of the founders and leaders of the new security system to be created after this war. ""And we want to do it together with our European friends,"" said the Head of the President's Office."
To work every day to make the war shorter - this is our priority - address by the President of Ukraine,2022-05-13T23:08:00Z,"Unbreakable people of our most beautiful country! Our defenders! Today we can report on the 200th downed Russian military aircraft. Russia has not lost so many aircraft in any war in decades. And Russia has lost almost 27,000 soldiers, many of them young conscripts. Russia has lost more than three thousand tanks, armored combat vehicles, a large number of conventional military vehicles, helicopters, drones and all its prospects as a state. And why all this? For a monument to Lenin to stand in the temporarily occupied Henichesk for a little longer? There is no other result for Russia and there will not be any. In fact, no one today can predict how long this war will last. But we are doing everything we can to liberate our land quickly. This is our priority - to work every day to make the war shorter. However, this depends, unfortunately, not only on our people, who are already doing the maximum. It also depends on our partners. On European countries, on the countries of the whole free world. I am grateful to all those who are working to strengthen sanctions on Russia and to increase defense and financial support for us, for Ukraine. This is the only recipe for defending freedom in the face of Russia's invasion. And for Western countries, it's not just expenditures. It is not about accounting. It is about the future. The world has already recognized that Russia's blockade of our ports and this war are provoking a large-scale food crisis. Russian officials are also openly threatening the world that there will be famine in dozens of countries. And what could be the consequences of such a famine? What political instability and migration flows will this lead to? How much will you have to spend then to overcome the consequences? These are the questions that need to be answered by those who are delaying sanctions on Russia or trying to postpone aid to Ukraine. Every day of war is an increase in global threats, it is a new opportunity for Russia to provoke instability in other parts of the world, not only here in Europe. And these are new lost lives in Ukraine: Ukrainian men and women who give their lives so that everyone can live freely. I emphasize this: everyone, especially in those countries where they still find time to argue instead of investing in aid as much as possible. Therefore, much more pressure on Russia is needed. And I talk about it openly and daily to everyone on whom it depends. We continue to restore the de-occupied territories of Ukraine. As of today, 1015 settlements have been de-occupied, which is plus six in the past 24 hours. We return electricity, water supply, communications, transport, social services there. It is important. Of course, we remember every city and every community that is still under occupation. Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Enerhodar, Mariupol and all cities and towns of Donbas... The gradual liberation of the Kharkiv region proves that we will not leave anyone to the enemy. We do not stop trying to save all our people from Mariupol and Azovstal. Currently, very difficult negotiations are underway on the next stage of the evacuation mission - the rescue of the seriously wounded, medics. It is a large number of people. Of course, we are doing everything to evacuate everyone else, each of our defenders. Everyone in the world who can be the most influential mediator has already been involved in the relevant negotiations. Already 37 foreign missions have resumed their work in Kyiv. And I am grateful to all of them, because this is 37 proofs that Ukraine stands strong and has prospects in contrast to the Russian Federation. I am sure that other foreign missions will return to the capital soon. It is worth returning to work for all Ukrainian businesses that have not yet resumed operations, although they may do so in a safe area. Providing jobs and adjusting economic activity to the existing conditions is also a big contribution to defense, to our future. Traditionally, I signed a decree on awarding our heroes. 212 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. Eternal glory to everyone who defends our state! Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
"Olena Zelenska talked to the First Ladies of Poland, Lithuania and France",2022-05-13T20:02:00Z,"The First Lady of Ukraine Olena Zelenska spoke via video call with the First Lady of Poland Agata Kornhauser-Duda, Lithuania - Diana Nausėdienė, France - Brigitte Macron. She thanked the wives of the presidents for the warm welcome of Ukrainian citizens, the opportunity given to Ukrainians to receive medical and educational services on an equal footing with the citizens of their countries. There are currently 2.5 million temporary migrants from Ukraine in Poland, more than 50,000 in Lithuania, and more than 70,000 in France. The First Lady of Ukraine also thanked Poland and France for receiving Ukrainian children with oncology for treatment in the framework of the international evacuation initiative ""Flights of Life"". From March 2022, thanks to an agreement between the First Ladies, the leadership and ministries of health, as well as the cooperation of volunteer and medical organizations, children with cancer are first brought to Lviv, to the Western Ukrainian Specialized Children's Medical Center. Then, accompanied by medical teams, they and their relatives are taken to Poland, to a specially created Unicorn clinic. There, patients are assigned to Poland or other European countries for permanent treatment. Hundreds of children with oncology are currently receiving care in the Republic of Poland, and 45 patients have been transported by plane to France. ""Flights of Life"" will be continued, said the First Ladies. In addition, Olena Zelenska discussed with the wife of the President of Lithuania Diana Nausėdienė a new joint project - the newly established Ukrainian Center in Vilnius, which will become the center of cultural, social and educational life of Ukrainians in the Republic of Lithuania. ""We planned to develop it in such a way as to cover both language courses and psychological assistance, so that the center becomes the Ukrainian heart of Lithuania - a place for conferences, meetings, helping Ukrainians and Ukraine to integrate. By the way, the Ukrainian Center is now the official name, we agreed on it during the video chat,"" Olena Zelenska said. She offered her colleagues new projects for cooperation. In particular, the national program of psychological assistance. ""It is aimed at supporting children and their parents, people with disabilities, the elderly, combatants and their families. Last week, during a meeting with US First Lady Jill Biden in Uzhhorod, we talked about this project and came up with the idea of ​​involving other First Ladies in other countries to address psychological/mental health issues. Creating a system of psychological assistance in Ukraine, we will use the best world experience. The pain of war must be lived through, so that we have the strength to go further and accept life, so that the nation can build the future,"" said Olena Zelenska. The First Ladies also discussed the project ""Books without Borders"" to provide displaced children with publications in the Ukrainian language. To do this, Ukrainian publishers provide book layouts, and local publishers print them. In Poland, First Lady Agata Kornhauser-Duda agreed to take such a project under her patronage. In addition, the parties discussed a project to organize summer holidays for children of Ukrainian immigrants in Lithuania and France. ""When we created the club of the world's first ladies and gentlemen in Kyiv last year, no one expected the tragic circumstances under which its powerful force would be needed. And now every ""how are you?"" from my colleagues heals Ukrainian wounds literally! The friendship that is formed in such conditions will be the strongest. Thank you, friends. I'm waiting for us to be able to hug in a personal meeting,"" Olena Zelenska summed up."
Ukrainians have shown that you can have no fear and fight with one of the largest armies in the world - Andriy Yermak,2022-05-13T16:47:00Z,"The Ukrainian people have shown that you can have no fear and fight with one of the largest armies in the world, so Ukraine's membership in NATO would strengthen this organization. This was stated by Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak in an interview with CNN. He noted that the situation on the frontline is still difficult, but the Ukrainian military is succeeding in a counteroffensive in the Kharkiv direction. ""Our troops have pushed the enemy back, but fighting continues in the south-eastern part of Ukraine. And the situation in Mariupol remains catastrophic, where thousands of people are blocked, including Azovstal,” said Andriy Yermak. ""Our servicemen at Azovstal are blocked and are under constant massive bombardment by Russian forces. We use all our opportunities, we negotiate with many world leaders to save our people. This is very important for us. And President Zelenskyy is personally working 24/7 on this issue,"" he said. The Head of the President's Office thanked the UN for its efforts to evacuate civilians from the Azovstal plant. Andriy Yermak also stressed the need to increase sanctions on Russia in order to encourage it to reach a peaceful settlement. ""If this terrible war continues and every day Russia kills Ukrainians and destroys cities, it will show that the existing sanctions are not enough,"" he said. The Head of the President's Office reminded that the international expert group headed by him and former US National Security Adviser Michael McFaul is actively working to assess the current sanctions and propose new ones. According to Andriy Yermak, the experts have prepared a document containing recommendations on actions in the energy sector. This is a complete embargo on Russia's energy resources, especially oil. He noted that since the beginning of the full-scale war, Russia, according to official figures, has received more than $ 65 billion from energy sales. ""It feeds Russia's military machine and allows the war against Ukraine to be continued,"" he added. Answering the question about Finland's plans to join NATO under the fast-track procedure, while Ukraine has been trying unsuccessfully for a long time to join the Alliance, Andriy Yermak said: “We believe that this situation is a test for the Alliance. We are very happy for our friends in Finland - in fact, it is a logical step. At the same time, it demonstrates NATO's double standards, as the whole world has seen that Ukraine has long ago decided to join the Alliance, but we still do not have any concrete answer. Now our courageous and heroic nation has shown that Ukraine's participation and membership in NATO would strengthen this organization."" The Head of the Office of the President stressed that Ukrainians have shown that one can have no fear and fight against one of the largest armies in the world. Commenting on Russian President Vladimir Putin's statements that Russian troops have been sent to Ukraine to fight the Nazis, Andriy Yermak said that the Russian-speaking cities of Kharkiv and Mariupol had suffered the most damage from Russia. Russia also struck at Uman and Babyn Yar, which are important to the Jewish people. ""Everything it does (Russia - ed.) in Ukraine is directed against Ukrainians. We are grateful to the parliaments of the world who are already recognizing this war as genocide. The picture from Bucha, Irpin and Mariupol gives a clear answer as to who is continuing the Nazi practices of World War II and who is defending native land and country. And we will fight until we achieve victory,"" Andriy Yermak stressed."
"President of Ukraine: If Russia wants peace, it must withdraw its troops from our land",2022-05-13T16:07:00Z,"Given all the crimes committed by the Russian army in Ukraine, Ukrainian society is not ready for dialogue with the Russian side, but President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is ready to continue negotiations to end the war, liberate the occupied territories and save lives. This was stated by the President in an interview with the Porta a Porta project of the Italian TV channel Rai 1. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, every day in Ukraine certain towns are liberated from the occupiers, and traces of tormenting, torture and executions of civilians by the Russian military are found there. This causes Ukrainian citizens to reject the issue of ending the war through negotiations. ""However, as President, I am ready to talk to Putin, but only to him. Without any intermediaries. And on the terms of dialogue, not on the terms of ultimatum,"" he said. Commenting on the words of some European leaders that it is necessary to look for approaches to Vladimir Putin, the Ukrainian Head of State stressed that the search for such ways should not be at the cost of Ukrainian blood, especially when the Russian president does not show a desire to end the war. ""We have been looking for them for many years, and today the corpses of our people are on these paths. And I am not ready to find such bloody paths to Putin,"" the Head of State said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that when people seek to resolve conflicts, they look for ways to dialogue. However, given what Russia has done, such a conversation is no longer possible. ""That is why there must be a pragmatic dialogue today. And Russia's desire is needed. Because it will be late. Another such bloody case as it was in Bucha, Borodyanka or what is happening in Mariupol - and people will not have patience anymore. Because people do not want to forgive anything,"" the President said. At the same time, he noted that if there is even the slightest chance for negotiations, it should be used. ""We understand that peace comes after every war, and even when there is a one percent chance of ending the war through dialogue and resolving a military conflict, we need to cling to it,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Asked what kind of peace Ukraine wants, the President said: “Ordinary things. Respect for sovereignty. Respect for territorial integrity. Respect for traditions, people, language. Just respect for the people, society and the independence of our state."" ""All these ordinary, normal things that the Russian Federation has violated. They need to be restored. What is restoration? Withdraw your troops from our land. There are no our troops on the territory of the Russian Federation. Withdraw your troops, de-occupy our homes, our villages,"" he added. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also stressed that there can be no compromise on Ukraine's sovereignty and independence. ""However, in the negotiations we are ready to say - at least get out of the territory you occupied starting from the 24th (February 24, 2022 - ed.). Yes, in some of our temporarily occupied territories, you unfortunately continue to stay. But this is the first clear step to talk about something. Let's do it,"" the President said. However, according to him, the Russian side does not respond to these proposals. In addition, Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his conviction that dialogue is impossible today without the tough and strong position of foreign partners on Russia's actions, as well as without the defensive support for Ukraine. ""Everyone is united in the opinion that it is necessary to restore the territorial integrity of Ukraine. At least that's what European leaders, the United States, Canada, Britain, and so on, tell me. I am convinced that when it comes to clear values, we are all united. But without a strong real army, Ukraine will not be strong at the negotiating table with Russia. And we need this strength. It is very important for us,"" the President stated."
"Russia's strategic defeat is obvious to everyone in the world, Russia simply lacks courage to admit it so far - address by the President of Ukraine",2022-05-12T23:16:00Z,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! I do not tire of repeating these words, addressing everyone - everyone who defends the state. Today these words sound special. On the International Nurses Day. The professional holiday of tens of thousands of Ukrainian women, as well as Ukrainian paramedic officers who are doing one of the most important things for victory - saving the lives of our soldiers, our civilians. Today I had the honor to present state awards to the representatives of this profession. Those who did not stop working and rescuing people under enemy fire and during the occupation. Tetiana Tarasenko, Alla Chernets and Liudmyla Husak from the Sumy region. Vira Tselyk, Oksana Umanets and Iryna Vernyhora from Chernihiv. Oksana Balandina from the Luhansk region. Svitlana Klymenko and Maria Adamenko from the Kyiv region. Natalia Abashnyk from Kharkiv. With all my heart I thank all the nurses, all the medical workers who help Ukrainians fight every day and every night. And today I urge everyone who has not yet thanked them to do so. Eight years of war in Donbas, two years of pandemic, the third month of full-scale war and all their professional life they dedicate to you, us, everyone - society. So that Ukraine lives. I was very pleased to see the working conditions of our doctors at the Center for Pediatric Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery in Kyiv. The new building of the Center was built as part of our Large Construction program. And this is a truly modern building. There you feel that our medical system, our medicine can really be on a par with the world's best medical systems. We invested in the development of medicine and all social infrastructure before the war, and we will definitely continue to do so after the war. Let the occupiers not hope that they will stop us. During the fighting since February 24, Russian troops have destroyed 570 healthcare facilities. 101 hospitals were completely destroyed. What is it? This is nonsense. This is barbarism. This is the self-destruction of Russia as a state that at least someone in the world could look at as a cultural nation. Tonight they struck at the Chernihiv region, at schools. Of course, the Russian state is in such conditions that any education only hinders it. But what can be achieved by destroying Ukrainian schools? All Russian commanders who give such orders are just sick. Incurably. But all the hospitals that the occupiers destroyed, all the schools, all the universities that they bombed, all the houses, bridges, businesses - we will rebuild everything. The occupiers struck today at the Poltava region, at Kremenchuk. Again at the plant, so that people do not have fuel. Really sick. At the Zaporizhzhia region, at the cities and villages of Donbas. But what does it give them? Russia's strategic defeat is already obvious to everyone in the world and even to those who still continue to communicate with them. Russia simply lacks courage to admit it so far. They are cowards. And they are trying to hide the truth behind missile, air and artillery strikes. Therefore, our task is to fight until we achieve our goals in this war. Free our land, our people and reliably ensure our security. I spoke with the President of Finland. We discussed Ukraine's European integration and defense cooperation. I also spoke with Slovak President Zuzana Čaputová. I thanked her for the support provided to Ukraine. We agreed on the next steps in the whole spectrum of relations: defense, sanctions, economy, including fuel imports, and further rapprochement with the European Union. I am preparing to continue special formats of communication with friendly societies, in particular with students from partner countries. I will address American students soon. And students from European countries as well. We must spread our Ukrainian ideas and explain at all levels how we, Ukrainians, see life in Europe and the world after this war. A war that changes everything in world politics. I am grateful to the friend of Ukraine, Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte, for today's address to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. This is an important gesture of support. More importantly, the Netherlands is advocating the abandonment of Russian oil and is ready to do so without delay. I signed decrees awarding our defenders. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Colonel Kachur Roman Volodymyrovych, Commander of the 55th separate artillery brigade of the Operational Command ""East"" of the Ground Forces. 269 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 14 of them posthumously. Eternal glory to all who stood up for Ukraine! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
Sanctions on Russia must be long-term in order to force it to end the war against Ukraine and prevent similar aggression in the future - Andriy Yermak,2022-05-12T22:38:00Z,"Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak emphasizes that Russia's war against Ukraine is an aggression against the whole of Europe and an attack on generally accepted principles of international relations, and the aggressor must be stopped by joint efforts, including systemic long-term sanctions. He noted this during an online meeting with influential European officials and diplomats. ""It would be naive to expect that the Russian leadership will abandon its plans due to lower living standards of Russian citizens. So we need to make sure that the financial system does not cope with this burden, that Russian industry does not have the technical capabilities, technology and materials to produce weapons of war. Therefore, sanctions must be long-term,"" Andriy Yermak said. The Head of the President's Office reminded that a team of leading international and Ukrainian experts (Yermak-McFaul group), formed as a result of the initiative of President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had developed an Action Plan to strengthen sanctions on Russia. First of all, it envisages a full embargo on Russia's energy resources, the main source of funding for Russia's military machine. It is proposed to maximize transport and insurance sanctions, disconnect all Russian financial institutions from the world system. Recognition of Russia as a state - sponsor of terrorism and its exclusion from the FATF, the expansion of personal sanctions against the vast majority of Russian officials, oligarchs and propagandists are very important. Further sanctions against Russian state-owned enterprises are also needed. Andriy Yermak stressed that it is also important to impose secondary sanctions on states, individuals or legal entities that facilitate Russia's aggression or help it circumvent sanctions. ""I would like to emphasize that the Plan envisages strengthening transparency measures and deepening coordination. Synchronization of sanctions policies in time and legal limits is a very important factor in increasing their effectiveness,"" he said. In addition, Andriy Yermak informed about a new initiative of the group of sanction experts - the Roadmap presented on May 9, which contains a step-by-step strategy with detailed recommendations for the European Union on the implementation of energy sanctions. ""We are making clear proposals to minimize Russia's oil revenues during the transition period and to ensure a managed phased embargo on Russian gas imports. Our proposals are aimed at reducing the shock to European economies from such steps. It is first of all about the regulated import tax or tariff and keeping funds for energy on a special escrow account,"" he said. The Head of the President's Office noted that the Yermak-McFaul international expert group commends the decision of the European Commission to impose a total ban on imports of all Russian oil, which is very important. Andriy Yermak stressed that such decisions should be made quickly today, as they will help save as many lives of Ukrainians as possible, reduce the destruction in our country due to the war, and reduce the food crisis in the world with all its consequences. Decisions to support Ukraine in the trade and economic sphere are also important. According to him, Ukraine's active cooperation with the EU during this difficult period proves that our country is already part of a single European team, and this is facing increasing support among citizens of European countries. And Ukraine's post-war reconstruction and deeper economic integration with the establishment of new high-tech enterprises will also benefit European corporations. Andriy Yermak stated that Ukraine is determined to continue the integration process, and proposals on ""alternatives to European integration"" are unacceptable for our country. ""Ukraine must become part of a united Europe as soon as possible. This is a matter of mutual security,"" he said. Answering the questions of the participants of the meeting about how else Europe can support Ukraine, Andriy Yermak noted that our country still needs more weapons, and European capitals know exactly what kinds of weapons. ""If this war continues, it means that sanctions are not enough and weapons are not enough. And we will not stop talking about these topics,"" said the Head of the President's Office. Andriy Yermak noted that Ukraine will never compromise on its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within internationally recognized borders. He also noted that with the start of this war, it became clear that there was no reliable security system in Europe and around the world. And now one of the main issues is future clear security guarantees for Ukraine. According to him, our state would like to see as many countries as possible among the guarantors. The issue of reparations was also raised during the conversation, which is extremely important given the terrible destruction caused by the Russian army in our country. According to him, as in the case of sanctions, professional experts will propose clear mechanisms that would allow confiscated Russian assets, funds on escrow accounts, etc. to be directed to the needs of affected citizens and the reconstruction of Ukraine's infrastructure."
Ihor Zhovkva noted the importance of Estonia's assistance in the issue of Ukraine's European integration movement,2022-05-12T20:56:00Z,"Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Ihor Zhovkva held a video consultation with Foreign Policy Adviser to the Prime Minister of the Republic of Estonia Liis Lipre-Järma. Ihor Zhovkva informed the interlocutor in detail about the security situation in our country and the resistance to Russian military aggression. He expressed sincere gratitude to the Government of Estonia and the Estonian people for their unwavering political support and the important practical assistance provided to Ukraine by official Tallinn. ""We highly appreciate the fact that Estonia became the first country whose parliament decided to recognize Russia's war against Ukraine an act of genocide,"" said the Deputy Head of the President's Office. During the conversation, special attention was paid to the importance of continuing sanctions pressure on Russia from the European Union in order to end the war as soon as possible and liberate the temporarily occupied territories of the Ukrainian state. The interlocutors discussed in detail bilateral cooperation to implement Ukraine's strategic course towards European integration. Ihor Zhovkva noted the importance of Estonia's effective assistance in the issue of Ukraine's European integration movement and our country's intentions to obtain the status of a candidate country for accession to the European Union in the near future. Ihor Zhovkva and Liis Lipre-Järma also coordinated the schedule of high-level bilateral events for the near future."
President visited the newly built building of the Center for Pediatric Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery and presented awards to nurses,2022-05-12T17:18:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy inspected the newly built building of the Scientific and Practical Medical Center for Pediatric Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery of the Ministry of Health in Kyiv. The completion of the building was carried out in the framework of the Large Construction National Program initiated by the Head of State. During a visit to the medical facility, the President talked to 12-year-old patient Vladyslav Honcharuk, who had been hiding with his family in a basement in the village of Demydiv, Kyiv region, for more than two weeks, fleeing enemy shelling. Due to living in difficult conditions, the boy fell ill. He is currently preparing for the operation, which will be carried out by director of the Center Ilya Yemets. Volodymyr Zelenskyy wished Vladyslav a speedy recovery and expressed belief that the boy would overcome the disease. “It is very nice when the institution has a high level of modernity and a high level of the medical industry in Ukraine. Made in Ukraine is cool,” he said. On the occasion of the International Nurses Day, the President of Ukraine presented state awards to medical workers who have been helping wounded servicemen and civilians since the first days of the full-scale Russian invasion, saving lives in regions where fierce fighting against the occupiers continues. ""It is you who are protecting our defenders who are defending our borders. And on this day I want to congratulate you and thank you on behalf of our soldiers and civilians,"" the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that the nurses were next to the wounded defenders in difficult times on the battlefield and in hospitals. They gave them all their strength and such valuable attention and experienced pain together with the wounded soldiers. ""I want to wish you good health. I am very grateful for your great work,” the President said. The attendees also honored the memory of the nurses who died rescuing the defenders of Ukraine with a moment of silence."
"Behind the courage and wisdom of the Ukrainian people are thousands of real stories, names and feats - President at The Atlantic Council’s Distinguished Leadership Awards",2022-05-12T08:51:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke at The Atlantic Council's Distinguished Leadership Awards, which was won by the Ukrainian people. The prize was awarded to Ukrainians for their resilience and courage in resisting the Russian invasion. This is the first time The Atlantic Council has awarded an entire people or nation. In a video address, Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked for the award and noted that it is a fair and correct gesture to honor with this award all the people of Ukraine, because courage is a national trait of Ukrainian character. “Today the whole world witnesses this and admires the heroism of Ukrainians. At the same time, I want it not to become something ordinary for everyone. And for this we must say and remember that behind the courage and wisdom of our people, there are thousands of real stories, names and heroic feats,” the Head of State said. According to him, the world should know and hear about Ukrainians, and have a clear idea and understanding about the people of Ukraine.  “First of all, we are the nation of the best defenders. These are our ground forces, air and naval forces, airborne assault troops, special operations forces, the National Guard, intelligence, border guards, and territorial defense fighters,” the President emphasized. Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the stories of Ukrainian heroes, including border guards from Zmiinyi Island, who were not afraid of the flagship of the Russian fleet - cruiser Moskva, as well as indomitable defenders of Mariupol and Azovstal, who have been holding the line there for several months already with extremely limited resources. The President stressed that the Ukrainian people are people who do not spare themselves for the sake of others, these are brave children, elderly people who have gone through too many hardships, hundreds of thousands of those who are fighting, and millions of those who are volunteering and helping. “This is a business that has shifted to the needs of the country. Clothing designers sew military uniforms, restaurateurs feed free lunches, bakeries bake bread for IDPs and lonely people. This is a university professor who continues to lecture to his students in the trenches. A violinist playing for people during an air alarm in a bomb shelter. These are civilians of Ukrainian cities and villages, who became a living wall on the way of the occupiers – stopping military machines and turning tanks in the opposite direction. These are inhabitants of Demydivka, who flooded their own village not to let the occupier into Kyiv,” the President told. He also recalled the brave residents of the temporarily occupied Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Enerhodar, Mariupol, towns and villages, who, despite threats and shots from the invaders, went to peaceful rallies in support of Ukraine. “These are millions of Ukrainians who are now defending their Homeland and the whole world. Do not be afraid and come to Ukraine. Hear thousands of similar stories about us, Ukrainians. Look into their brave eyes, shake their strong hands, and you will see that they are doing all this not for glory, that they need not only awards, but also concrete help and support,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. According to the President, the citizens of Ukraine need weapons, financial support and increased sanctions on Russia. “And the most important: the feeling that in this difficult struggle they are not alone, that they are supported by you, by the whole world – free states and free nations of our planet,” the President concluded. The award for the Ukrainian people was handed over to Ambassador of Ukraine to the United States Oksana Markarova. The Atlantic Council’s Distinguished Leadership Awards is an annual live event in Washington. This year the ceremony was attended by about 500 people from more than 30 countries."
Speech by the President of Ukraine at The Atlantic Council’s Distinguished Leadership Awards,2022-05-12T08:46:00Z,"Ladies and Gentlemen! On behalf of all Ukrainians, I would like to thank you for this award. It is a fair and correct gesture to honor with this award all the people of Ukraine, because courage is our national trait of character. Today the whole world witnesses this and admires the heroism of Ukrainians. At the same time, I want it not to become something ordinary for everyone. And for this we must say and remember that behind the courage and wisdom of our people, there are thousands of real stories, names and heroic feats. The world should know about them and to have a clear idea and understanding about the people of Ukraine. First of all, we are the nation of the best defenders. These are our ground forces, air and naval forces, airborne assault troops, special operations forces, the National Guard, intelligence, border guards, and territorial defense fighters. This is Vitalii Skakun, who blew up a bridge sacrificing himself to stop a column of Russian tanks.  This is 21-year-old lieutenant Vitalii Sapilo, who neutralized 30 units of equipment of the enemy and died from an air strike. Serhiy Pantelyuk, who was injured while repelling the attack and died at the hospital while his first daughter was being born. These are the border guards of Zmiinyi Island, who were not afraid of the flagship of the Russian fleet - cruiser Moskva - and sent a Russian ship in a direction that became world-famous. These are the indomitable defenders of Mariupol and Azovstal, who have been holding the line there for several months. These are all our fighters who died defending Ukraine, hence defending Europe. I would like to ask you to honor their memory with a moment of silence. Thank you. The Ukrainian people are people who do not spare themselves for the sake of others. This is combat medic Diana Kukurudziak, who pulled 16 wounded soldiers off the battlefield in one day. Paramedic Serhiy Chornobryvets in Mariupol, who has been on duty for 22 days since the beginning of the war. The Ukrainian people are a nation of courageous children. This is 11-year-old Maksym, who said nothing to his mother, ran away from home and came to ask for permission to be a part of territorial defense. This is 7-year-old Varya from Kropyvnytskyi who gave her money saved for a smartphone to buy bulletproof vests, and then sold flowers and drawings.  This is a 15-year-old girl from the Luhansk region who was driving a car with shot legs and took out four wounded. A 15-year-old boy who carried his wounded mother in his arms for 3 kilometers to the evacuation point. Our people are also elderly people who have experienced too many ordeals. This is Borys Romanchenko, who passed through the hell of Buchenwald and died at the age of 96, at home, during the shelling of Kharkiv by the Russian Federation. This is Vanda Obiedkova, who as a child, hiding in the basement, survived the Holocaust and the Nazi occupation of Mariupol, saw the second occupation of the city in 2014, and the third - this year. At the age of 91, she had to hide in the basement again, where she died on the 40th day of the war. This is 87-year-old Halyna Kotubey from Mykolaiv region, who remained the only and last resident of her village, but refused to leave.  The Ukrainian people are a nation where hundreds of thousands fight and millions help. This is a business that has shifted to the needs of the country. Clothing designers sew military uniforms, restaurateurs feed free lunches, bakeries bake bread for IDPs and lonely people. This is a university professor who continues to lecture to his students in the trenches. A violinist playing for people during an air alarm in a bomb shelter. These are civilians of Ukrainian cities and villages, who became a living wall on the way of the occupiers – stopping military machines and turning tanks in the opposite direction. These are inhabitants of Demydivka, who flooded their own village not to let the occupier into Kyiv. Those who despite threats, shots and stun grenades go to peaceful rallies, reminding the occupants that this is Ukraine: Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Enerhodar, Mariupol and all other cities and villages of Ukraine occupied not for a long time.  These are millions of Ukrainians who are now defending their Homeland and the whole world. Do not be afraid and come to Ukraine. Hear thousands of similar stories about us, Ukrainians. Look into their brave eyes, shake their strong hands, and you will see that they are doing all this not for glory, that they need not only awards, but also concrete help and support. Weapons, equipment, financial support, sanctions on Russia, and the most important: the feeling that in this difficult struggle they are not alone, that they are supported by you, by the whole world – free states and free nations of our planet. Thank you! Thank you for your attention! Thank you for your support! Thank you for the award and welcome to Ukraine!"
"We will liberate our land and people, and with the help of the free world it will be easier to do – address by the President of Ukraine",2022-05-11T22:18:00Z,"Ukrainians! Unbreakable people of our country! We have a series of important news - clearly positive for our defense. First. The House of Representatives of the United States Congress voted for a new and significant package of support for our state and global democracy. Almost $ 40 billion. A second vote will be held soon in the US Senate. This decision will then be signed by President Biden and will take effect. I am grateful to the people of America and to all our friends in Congress and Administration for their support. What exactly is positive? These funds will be used as quickly as possible and without bureaucracy to strengthen Ukraine's defense. First of all, it is weapons and ammunition for us, equipment. But not only that. It is also a support for the investigation of war crimes of the Russian Federation, the occupiers, support for diplomatic work and more. The second decision is important and even historic. This is an update of America's famous Lend-Lease program. People who remember history well know that Lend-Lease was one of the key preconditions for the Allied victory in World War II. Lend-Lease assistance from the United States to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union has dramatically changed the balance of power in Europe. Europeans then received a wide range of products under Lend-Lease - from aircraft to trucks, from aviation fuel to communication means. By the way, American radio stations and other things provided under Lend-Lease worked for the Soviet people long after the war. For decades. Hitler's Germany, even with all the resources in the occupied territories, could do nothing to counter this potential of the Allies on the basis of American productive capacities. And it is no coincidence that the new Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act was signed on May 9. I am personally grateful to President Biden for this support, for this decision and for such symbolism. Because we are now defending freedom and the right to life for all free nations in the war against tyranny, which poses no less of a threat to Europe than it did 80 years ago. Simply put, Lend-Lease is a scheme to give us everything we need for defense. Although formally it is like a loan, in fact it is so profitable that it is incorrect to call it a loan. Firstly, we will have access to modern weapons, ammunition, equipment, and we do not need to look for options to pay for it all. Secondly, now the President of the United States will not have to agree with Congress on the assistance he provides. This will speed up the delivery. And there is one more thing that should be said separately. Ukraine is constantly discussing security guarantees for itself with our friends in a very substantive way. The G7 meeting on May 8, in which our state took part for the first time at the level of leaders, was first and foremost about that. We are negotiating with the world's leading nations to give Ukraine confidence in security for decades to come. This is the first time in the history of our state when it is possible to fix such guarantees. Not something in the memorandum, not some declarative desire for some kind of course, but specific guarantees. Not only legally significant, but also spelled out so that it is clear: what exactly, who exactly and how exactly guarantees us. God willing. Of course, all these things will not work in one or several days. But I am sure that this May will be of special significance in Ukrainian history. Yes, Russian troops are still on our land. Those outcasts whom the Russian state has found for itself as collaborators make statements of cosmic scale and cosmic stupidity, as their level was characterized in ""Heart of a Dog"". But no matter what the occupiers do, it doesn't mean anything. They stand no chance. I am confident that we will liberate our land and people. By the way, today in communication with students of French universities I felt such confidence in their questions. And with new support from the United States, with Lend-Lease, with all the help we get from the UK and the European Union, from Canada, Japan, Australia – without exaggeration, from the whole free world – it will be easier for us. I also spoke today with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. On defense assistance to Ukraine, energy cooperation and new sanctions. New – against Russia. Step by step, we are doing everything to make the aggressor most hurt by aggression. However, speaking about the help of partners, we must not forget that victory is gained directly by Ukrainians who are fighting. By all who beat the enemy and strengthen the defense. Just yesterday, 404 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. The title of Hero of Ukraine (posthumously) was awarded to Colonel Ihor Bedzay, Chief of the Aviation Security Service - Senior Inspector-Pilot of the Naval Command. In total, more than 13,000 of our servicemen received state awards during the full-scale war. This definitely characterizes the courage of all our defenders. I am grateful to each and every one of them! Very grateful. Eternal glory to all who fight for freedom! Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for us, for everyone. For Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
Andriy Yermak and Michael McFaul discussed further steps to enhance sanctions on Russia,2022-05-11T21:37:00Z,"Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak and Director of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies (FSI), Former US National Security Adviser, Ambassador Michael McFaul, who are chairing the international working group on sanctions against Russia held a regular online meeting to discuss further steps to increase sanctions pressure. The main focus was on the institution of sanctions against the leadership of the Russian Federation and Russian oligarchs close to power. This topic will be reflected in the new work of the expert group. In addition, Andriy Yermak and Michael McFaul discussed Ukraine's international security guarantees, as well as preparations for a speech by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Stanford University in late May."
Even the public mention of the possible use of nuclear weapons by the leadership of the nuclear state should be the basis for preventive sanctions - Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-05-11T20:10:00Z,"If the leader of a nuclear state publicly accepts the use of nuclear weapons by his country, this should be a reason for severe response and preventive sanctions, as it violates international agreements. This was emphasized by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during online communication with students of leading universities in France, representatives of academia and the media. The Head of State reminded that he had repeatedly raised the issue of threats of using nuclear weapons by the Russian Federation, in particular at the Munich Security Conference in February this year, shortly before the start of Russia's war against Ukraine. The President noted that Russia is not the only one in the world to voice such threats, and the worst thing is if it uses not only threats, but also its nuclear capabilities, as this will be a signal to everyone that this is possible. ""Therefore, I believe that there should be preventive sanctions. If a person talks about it in the media, if he or she says it publicly and threatens to use nuclear weapons in case… Then it is not even interesting what this person says. In case of what? Such ultimata are not worth attention at all. This indicates that any agreement on the non-use of nuclear weapons has already been discredited,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. According to him, such discrediting occurred after Russia violated the Budapest Memorandum and after public threats to use nuclear weapons. The Head of State is convinced that Russian President Vladimir Putin is primarily responsible for this situation. ""Because not everyone in Russia stands in favor of using nuclear weapons against Ukraine or the world. I'm sure of it. There are many people who support both Ukraine and the civilized way of resolving any military conflicts, and support peaceful settlement. But, unfortunately, due to the information policy, their percentage in Russia is getting smaller and smaller,"" he said. The President of Ukraine also noted that he fully supports the approach to the need for nuclear disarmament. ""If we do not control the violation of international law by a nuclear state, it means that we do not control the future, even the possible use of a nuclear weapon. And if we can't do that, we need to raise the issue of abolishing the possibility of using certain weapons, the availability of these weapons in a particular state. This is the only way out,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. "
The war will end when Ukraine returns everything that the aggressor took from it – President,2022-05-11T19:53:00Z,"Ukraine wants to return the occupied territories, as well as to defend the freedom and human rights that the Russian aggressor is trying to take away from Ukrainian citizens. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during an online conversation with students of leading universities in France, representatives of academia and the media. ""The war will end for the Ukrainian people only when we get back what's ours. We do not need too much, because everything needs to be watched, we need only what’s ours. We want to return peace to our state, to our land,"" he said. ""We want to get our land back, because our history is tied with it, it is respect for international law,"" the President stressed. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that today Ukraine is forced to fight for the right to life at the cost of the lives of its citizens. ""When we return everything ours, we will end this war. I wish Russia would hear people like you (it doesn’t hear us), hear the leaders of the world. I wish it would be put at the negotiating table, and understand the inevitability of punishment and the great erroneousness of its steps,"" the President said. According to the Head of State, any negotiations, including peace talks, should take place through dialogue, not ultimata. At the same time, Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that the chances of ending the war through diplomacy decrease every time Russian troops commit heinous crimes against Ukrainians, as happened in Bucha and Mariupol."
Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy to students of leading French universities,2022-05-11T19:15:00Z,"I am glad to greet you from our capital, from Kyiv. Today is the 77th day of Russia's full-scale war against our state. And it happens 77 years after the end of the largest war in Europe - World War II. When that war ended, political leaders and nations sought to create a security architecture that would make it impossible to repeat the war in Europe. And when I say the word ""security"" now, I use it in the broad sense of the word. It is not only a military component, but also economic, political, educational, cultural and memorial. Europeans have done a lot to ensure that the continent always has the opportunity to resolve any issues through dialogue. Through communication. So that it is not possible for one politician, one person or a group of politicians to provoke a large-scale war again, which will take thousands or even millions of lives. And, by the way, the contribution of students, including French students, to such changes in Europe is extremely significant. Since May 1968, there has been no politician who would not fear that people would come to him and say: it is forbidden to forbid. But why, despite all this, all this history, do we in Europe now have no tool to stop Russian aggression, except the courage and wisdom of Ukrainian men and women who defend our state? How did it happen that the whole security architecture that was created in Europe after World War II did not work? And not only did not work, but to a large extent did not even try. 77 days of brutal Russian war, which can truly be called a total war to destroy the Ukrainian people. Cities and villages in Ukraine were destroyed. You know this. There is nothing left of the city of Volnovakha in Donbas. Before this war about 20 thousand people lived there. Now it's all ashes. The half-million city of Mariupol is now just ruins. How many people are there now? Several tens of thousands out of half a million. At least 20,000 Mariupol residents were killed by Russian strikes at the city. Unfortunately, there are many such examples in Ukraine. Today, 12 million people have been forced to flee the war and become internally displaced persons. More than 10,000 Russian military crimes have been recorded. And this is just what is legally recorded as of this day. How did all this become possible? And why are no global or European institutions enough now to stop this war? You know, I don't want these questions to remain rhetorical. These questions really need to be answered, because these questions are actually about you and me, about Europe. About how we all live. From the Atlantic region to our cities, our communities in the Kharkiv region and in Donbas, which right now, right now, while we are here with you, are being fired upon by Russian troops from artillery, aircraft, and so on. I was told that the rules of our meeting today provide for my address and the opportunity for five students to ask certain questions. I think this is still an unfair regulation. Five questions are not enough to understand a person and to understand the situation. And it will look like a privilege for a few when thousands listen to us. But I understand that you and I have limited time. I'm also interested in asking you questions to hear what you think. So that it is really communication. For example, about NATO. About world security. About the architecture of this security. About the 5th article of the Treaty. For years, Europe has feared Ukraine's accession to NATO, because if a war broke out with Russia - they said so - everyone would have to fight against it. I would rather say - for Ukraine. But isn't that the point of NATO? Isn't that all for one? And if Russia goes further, for example to the Baltic countries, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia - any country. Will NATO fight against Russia, for example, for Latvia? Will Article 5 work then, given that most of you have never been to Latvia and may not even have ties to that country? There is also another aspect to this. Russia has already started a war against Ukraine, but we are not in NATO. And then why are we not in the European Union? Russia has already started a war. And you see how it fights. What else can you be afraid of now? And why does our common European home still have an internal division between those who were admitted and Ukraine? Which is behind the door, but at the same time fighting, defending European values, EU values: freedom and other fundamental values. And here is my second question to you: why did one person, Vladimir Putin, decide to start a war? It was a wrong and catastrophic decision. But why did he still approve it? And is there now in Europe, perhaps even in France or in any other country, a man or woman who can also start such a war against neighbors? Of course, I don't want that for anyone. But are we protected from this? Are you protected from this? One more question of mine to you - why did the Russian military, when occupying the territory of Ukraine, torment people with such pleasure and so massively? Why didn't they just shoot or capture or kill people like in war. Why did they rape, why did they torture people? Why did they cut off people's heads, fingers, why did they break legs? Why did Russian soldiers rape children in front of their parents? How can you - already adults - explain this? In your opinion, did they have just such an order or are they just like that? For example, a nine-year-old girl. Or an eleven-year-old boy. What should be in the head of a Russian soldier who rapes them in front of their parents, in front of their mother? Hundreds of such crimes have been recorded. There was even a Russian soldier who raped a baby and recorded a video of it, and then showed it to everyone. And how many such cases were in the occupied territories, about which we do not know yet? During World War II, the Nazis committed horrific crimes against all the nations of Europe. In particular, against Ukrainians and against Russians. For 77 years, much has been done to preserve the memory of those terrible crimes, which would ensure that they will never happen again. But why did the Russian military, when they came to Ukraine, start doing what the Nazis did? How did this become possible? My next question to you is: when will justice be restored? Why is there still no tool in the world that can bring all war criminals to justice quickly? Exactly quickly. Of course, our state will do everything to bring to justice every war criminal. And I am grateful to everyone who helps us. In particular, France. But there is an aspect of time. How long will it last? When will murderers and torturers receive sentences? And how to get them for trial, if they hide in Russia and if nothing changes there? There are many people of the future and different professions among you, and there are lawyers among you. Let them find the answer. So what can we do to speed up international justice? And what punishment do these criminals deserve? Specifically which one? What could be enough punishment for raping a child or shooting cars with refugees right on the roads just for fun? There were hundreds and thousands of such cases. And my fifth question to you is not difficult - personal. What influences politics and what influences the decision whether to engage in politics? Are you ready to get involved in politics? Would you like your father to be President? President of a state that defends itself in war and fights not just for independence, but literally for the right to life for its people? Or President of France - a state in peace? I want to explain my feelings to you. The feelings when you have a double responsibility - both for the state, because you are the President, and for your family, which found itself in a very special situation. When I decided to run for president, my daughter (she's now 18) was against it - totally. She was aware of how much life would change. It is a question of publicity, a question of security, certain responsibility - of the children of the President already. What do you think about it? And how would you feel now if you were the son or daughter of the President? So, as I understand, we have little time. And I would like you to give answers to my questions. And I can answer yours. It is important for this meeting of ours to be truly communication. And I would like to hear from you. At the end, I can ask the last question. If I get all the information from you. Thank you for your attention!"
The Armed Forces of Ukraine are doing everything to liberate all our cities and our people - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-05-10T22:46:00Z,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today has been a difficult day. There was news - both ordinary and tragic. I'll start with international contacts. I continued to address foreign parliaments. Those states and nations whose support is important to us. And especially now. In my address to the Slovak Parliament, I thanked for the strong defense, sanctions and other support. I explained our view on why energy cooperation with Russia cannot be considered in isolation from the aggressive policy of this country. And on the Ukrainian example, recalling the history of so-called gas friendship with Russia, I showed what mistakes should be avoided. Addressing the Maltese Parliament, I recalled the heroic battle for Malta in World War II, which is very similar in fact to our current struggle in the war for independence and freedom against Russia. Then, 80 years ago, the fate of the entire confrontation in the Mediterranean depended on the battle for Malta. The Allies won. The Nazis lost. We are doing everything to ensure that the confrontation on our land ends in this way now as well. And for this we need principled support and sanctions. In particular, from Malta. I held talks in Kyiv with the foreign ministers of Germany and the Netherlands. We talked about the strengthening of Ukraine, about the faster end of this war. We also discussed the details of how our friends can join the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine. I am also grateful to them for resuming the work of embassies in our capital. This is an important gesture that confirms Europe's confidence in Ukraine's future. In total, 36 foreign missions are already operating in the capital. The Armed Forces of our state provided us all with good news from the Kharkiv region. The occupiers are gradually being pushed away from Kharkiv. I am grateful to all our defenders who are holding the line and demonstrating truly superhuman strength to drive out the army of invaders. Once the second most powerful army in the world. But I also want to urge all our people, and especially those in the rear, not to spread excessive emotions. We shouldn't create an atmosphere of specific moral pressure, when certain victories are expected weekly and even daily. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are doing everything to liberate our land and our people. To liberate all our cities - Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Mariupol and all others. Today, a special group of international experts chaired by Michael McFaul and Andriy Yermak proposed a roadmap for energy sanctions. This is a detailed document that describes what needs to be done to make it really difficult for Russia to finance this war, but at the same time - so that the global economy does not suffer losses due to restrictions on Russian energy resources. This is a rationally drafted document, and work has already begun on its implementation. And the tragic news on which I want to end this address today. The first President of Ukraine Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk died today. He was not just a politician. And not just a historical figure. He was the man who knew how to find wise words and say them so that all Ukrainians could hear them. This is especially important in difficult, crisis moments. When the future of an entire country may depend on the wisdom of one person. Leonid Makarovych showed just such wisdom in the late 1980s, when the Ukrainian movement emerged. He passed 1991 brilliantly, and it is only now that it may seem as if it was easy for him then. And no matter what happened later, Leonid Kravchuk always stayed with Ukraine. Perhaps it was because of his wisdom that he was cheerful in a special way. He always valued life, every minute of it. But he always found much more than one minute to help sort things out and give advice. And I am personally grateful to him in particular for that. As a child he survived World War II, survived the occupation. Leonid Makarovych knew what freedom costs. And with all his heart he wanted peace for Ukraine. I'm sure we will implement it. We will achieve our victory and our peace. Eternal honor and memory to the first President of independent Ukraine! Eternal memory to all who defended Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
Speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Parliament of Malta,2022-05-10T19:12:00Z,"Dear Mr. Speaker! Dear Mr. Prime Minister! Dear opposition leader! Dear deputies! Maltese people! I am grateful for this opportunity to address all of you today. These days you are recalling the 80th anniversary of the extraordinary events that have affected not only the lives of your people, but the whole of Europe. The Battle of Malta during World War II was one of the crucial to defending freedom. The outcome of the confrontation in the Mediterranean, northern Africa and southern Europe largely depended on the resistance of your people, your island. Malta withstood the brutal siege, the brutal bombing. Together with its allies in the anti-Hitler coalition, it was able not only to defend itself, but also to become an outpost of freedom, that is, to play a significant role in the further liberation of Europe. Today's events in our part of the continent remind me of your heroic history. Just as the fate of Europe in 1940-1942 depended on the resilience and courage of Malta, today it is on the resilience and courage of Ukrainians, namely Ukrainians, our people, and certainly not the deputies of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, but ordinary resilient people that the victory of freedom on our continent depends. Because we are once again opposed to tyranny, and it has very far-reaching ambitions. By attacking Ukraine, Russia has only just begun its aggression against a united Europe. And you can feel better than other nations what evil Russia brings to the continent. They have already done this against your island. Just think of this terrible figure: 2154 Russian missiles hit our cities and communities in a little over two months. 2770 appearances of enemy planes in our sky were recorded. The Russian bombing of Ukraine does not cease any day or night. Just yesterday, when President of the European Council Charles Michel visited our warm city of Odesa and met with Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal, he was forced to go down to the bomb shelter. Because Russia launched another missile attack and hit, in particular, Odesa. On May 9. This is probably the first time that the High Representative of the European Union has continued the dialogue with his counterpart, escaping from the missile threat in the bomb shelter. In two days, on May 8 and 9, when Europeans honored the memory of the victims of World War II and celebrated Europe Day, the Russian army launched 25 missiles targeting Odesa and the Odesa region alone. All 25 missiles were aimed at civilian objects. Russian planes are constantly dropping air bombs and phosphorous bombs on buildings where the occupiers know for sure that there are no military there. That there are just people hiding. Ordinary peaceful Ukrainians, ordinary people like you. It's just terror. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, the Russian army has been trying to block our cities. The occupiers organized a real hell on our land in the city of Mariupol. They blocked it from both land and sea. Constantly bombed. More than 90 percent of all buildings were destroyed there. Before the war, by the way, it was a city of half a million. It was artificially starved. The Russian army has blocked the delivery of any food, drinking water or medicine. Did Russia know what was happening in Mariupol? Yes, they knew. But the Russian army was ordered to destroy this city. And kill as many of our people as possible. Its defenders still remain in Mariupol. They continue their resistance on the territory of the Azovstal plant. We use all possible diplomatic tools to organize rescue for them. But Russia has not yet agreed to any of the many options offered. We asked our partners for the necessary weapons to unblock Mariupol and save all people - both military and civilians. But we still do not have the necessary weapons and the amount needed to unblock Mariupol. What does it mean? You can fully understand this by simply remembering the importance of the British Spitfires in the spring Maltese sky of 1942. Thank God, Britain and the United States have accomplished this mission - with the Spitfires, which changed the course of the battle for Malta and helped destroy the ambition of the then aggressor to capture your island. And now we need a similar mission from our partners. To destroy the ambition of the current aggressor to capture Ukraine and other European countries. We need aircraft, helicopters, special artillery and other weapons, because now, as 80 years ago, Europe's future is decided on the battlefield. Ladies and Gentlemen! Maltese people! As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 226 children died. Thousands more adults were killed! And these are only those whose deaths have been officially recorded. About 12 million Ukrainians have become IDPs. About 5 million of them left our country. I'm sure you fully understand why this war needs to end as soon as possible. Why Russia must be forced to liberate the occupied Ukrainian territory as soon as possible. There are only three tools to ensure this. The first - I have already mentioned it - is weapons that allow us to withstand on the battlefield and save our people who are being killed by the Russian military. Killed every day and night. The longer the delay with weapons, the more deaths. The second is sanctions on Russia. They are needed not as an end in themselves, but to bring peace closer. What is most painful for Russia? Losing revenues from energy exports, from trade in energy. And also a complete blockade of banking operations. This is exactly what needs to be done. The aggressor must receive the greatest damage from aggression. Having launched a full-scale war against our state, Russia has blocked our ports in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. And this is a complete blockade of our agricultural exports. And this, in turn, is the path to a large-scale crisis in the global food market. If we fail to export wheat, barley, corn and vegetable oil, there will be a physical shortage of food in North Africa and parts of Asia, and prices will rise significantly. What's next? The threat of political chaos and a new migration crisis. Unfortunately, you can also feel the extremely negative consequences of these crises in your neighboring regions. So we need to act now, we need to act fast. An embargo on Russian oil, oil blends and petroleum products is a necessary condition for ending the Russian invasion of Ukraine. I know that this is a very sensitive topic for you, as well as for some other European countries. Given that vessels under your flag are used to transport, in particular, Russian oil. But every dollar and every euro you can earn on this will be offset by very significant and painful losses if the food crisis - and therefore the migration crisis - cannot be stopped - and if the Russian invasion goes further into Europe. And the third aspect. After thousands of war crimes of the Russian army in Ukraine... After thousands of murders, thousands of tortures, rapes, robberies... It is now dangerous to accept people with Russian passports, especially those formally or informally connected with the Russian state. Dangerous for all Europeans and also for Maltese. It is time to end the current privileges for Russian citizens. From gold passports with privileges to dual citizenship. Please do not allow yourself to be used, do not allow to use your island! Find out which Russians are trying to hide using your jurisdiction and your land. Block real estate, yachts and accounts owned by Russians, the activities of Russian IT and blockchain companies, Russian propaganda channels. This has long been more than just business in Russia, but the structures associated with the aggressive Russian state. Just as the free world united and fought against tyranny 80 years ago - in a way every nation could - we must all fight now, together. For freedom to endure, everyone must contribute. I am grateful to you for the decisions that Malta has already supported. I am also grateful for the decisions you will support in the future to protect Europe. And I believe that soon we will be able to develop our cooperation in a united Europe on a new level. When Ukraine will receive first the status of a candidate, and then full membership in the European Union. I count on your support! Thank you, Malta! Glory to Ukraine!"
President of Ukraine met with the Foreign Ministers of the Netherlands and Germany,2022-05-10T19:03:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany Annalena Baerbock and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands Wopke Hoekstra who are on a visit to our country. The President praised the comprehensive support provided by the Netherlands and Germany to Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion. ""Personal visits to Kyiv are an important gesture of solidarity with Ukraine on the part of your states - our allies and partners,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. The key attention during the meeting was paid to the further practical support of Ukraine by Germany and the Netherlands in the fight against Russian aggression, in particular in the field of defense. ""We have to win the fight for common values. It is through joint efforts with European partners, the European family, that we can win. Protect our citizens, our territories,"" the President of Ukraine stressed. The Head of State noted the clear position of the Netherlands and Germany on strengthening EU sanctions on Russia. He expressed hope that the sixth package of EU sanctions on Russia, which contains an oil embargo, would be approved immediately. There was also a substantive exchange of views on Ukraine's European integration. Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked for the high level of public support in the Netherlands and Germany for our country's membership in the EU and stressed that the immediate granting of candidate status will be a recognition of the contribution of Ukraine and Ukrainians to the protection of European values. The issues of economic support for our state in the conditions of Russian aggression were also discussed during the meeting. The President invited the Netherlands and Germany to join the reconstruction of Ukraine, in particular as part of the initiative of patronage over Ukrainian regions or sectors of the economy. The Head of State stressed the importance of developing an international plan for Ukraine's post-war reconstruction, similar to the historic Marshall Plan."
Andriy Yermak had a phone conversation with President of the World Economic Forum Børge Brende,2022-05-10T18:26:00Z,"Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak had a phone conversation with President of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Børge Brende. The parties discussed the participation of our state in this year's 51st session of the World Economic Forum, which will take place in Davos from May 22 to 26. It was noted that this year's WEF meeting will take place against the background of historical challenges for Ukraine, the whole of Europe and the world caused by the brutal war waged by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. Andriy Yermak stressed the importance of using the site of the World Economic Forum to consolidate international efforts to end Russia's aggression against our country, as well as to develop a strategic vision for the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine. The parties discussed the issue of holding a separate donor event in support of our country on the WEF sidelines. Its purpose should be to finance the reconstruction of settlements and critical infrastructure destroyed by the aggressor. The Head of the President's Office thanked Børge Brende for the clear position of the WEF leadership on supporting Ukraine and condemning Russia's full-scale aggression against our country."
Speech by the President of Ukraine at the National Council of the Slovak Republic,2022-05-10T15:19:00Z,"Dear Mr. Speaker of the National Council! Dear Mr. Prime Minister! Dear parliamentarians! Dear journalists! Dear Slovak people! Pozdravujem Vás s Kyjiva! It is an honor for me to address you today. And I want to start with words of gratitude for all the help that Slovakia has given to Ukraine. We greatly appreciate your defense support. And your determination in this support, which proves that you realize that freedom without force is just a fantasy and nothing more. It would be good if some other countries in Europe and the world learn this from you. We appreciate your solidarity with Ukraine at the level of the European Union. This was the case before February 24, when Russia launched a full-scale war and so it is now. Last year, we, with your President, Ms. Zuzana Čaputová, signed a Declaration of Recognition of the European Perspective of Ukraine. The significance of that step has now only grown stronger. Russia's war against our state is not only an attempt to seize our land, subdue our people and erase Ukrainian identity. Russia went to war in fact against all of united Europe, starting with Ukraine. This war is actually being waged by Russia against each of the states that want to live freely and choose their own future. That want to choose which unions to be in, who to be friends with and how to trade. This war is against the very project of a common alliance based on common values on our continent. What are these values? Respect for life, human rights, inviolability of borders and freedom. The Prime Minister of Slovakia, Mr. Eduard Heger, was one of our first foreign friends to visit the suburbs of Kyiv and see with his own eyes what the Russian occupiers have done there. Last week, Bucha and Borodyanka were also visited by your colleagues from the Slovak Parliament. They also saw with their own eyes what evil Russia is carrying. Thousands of crimes by Russian occupiers against civilians have been recorded in the Kyiv region alone. Murders, torture, abductions, looting and robberies have been reported. It is recorded that the occupiers tried to destroy everything that is connected not only with the Ukrainian national idea, but also simply with culture. What is the point of shelling and destroying schools in the area where the occupiers entered? They even destroyed schools! What does this mean? That we are at the epicenter of the confrontation of two ideas: the European democratic idea that the freedom and life of everyone matters and the cruel tyrannical idea that only a person who can subdue other people matters. That's what we need to stop together. Everyone in Europe. Because if we don't stop it, Russian troops will repeat the crimes they committed in Bucha and Borodyanka on the land of every state they can reach, in particular on the territory of your state. So the first and foremost tool to win this confrontation is weapons. And I can say on behalf of all our people that Ukrainians will always remember how Slovakia gave our country at a crucial time what really helped us. And there is potential to continue this cooperation, in particular, in the issue of aviation – aircraft, helicopters. You know, our flag, which is now very often seen by all Europeans in their cities – I am grateful to them – it reflects our fertile land – fields of yellow wheat. And also our beautiful blue sky. We have people to defend our land. But in the skies we need more support, including yours. The second tool is sanctions against Russia. Together with the use of effective weapons by our Armed Forces, sanctions create a truly reliable protection for the European idea. Because if the source of aggression weakens, life becomes more secure for everyone in Europe. The European Union is now agreeing on the sixth package of sanctions against Russia. And this is the required package, including the energy restrictions that are provided for in it. I understand that this is a challenge for you and some other countries. For Slovakia, the issue of Russian oil and the possibility of its replacement is not a matter of immediate action. We understand everything. But I want to give you, as our friends, one Ukrainian example. To make you better understand us. For a long time, Russian politicians have been fighting for the supply of Russian gas to Ukraine. They offered various supposedly profitable options – completely non-market, cheap and convenient, especially for Moscow. They offered to get a political decision from us about a larger volume of supplies and an easier scheme of payment for Russian gas. Not so long ago, Ukraine was one of the biggest sales destinations for Gazprom. What did it lead to? Ukraine depended not only on Russian gas, but also on Russian political decisions. And any attempt to move at least to market conditions in supply ended in gas wars, and ultimately in a bonded gas agreement, which posed a direct threat to our sovereignty. Ukrainian politicians have also been playing for a long time with the issue of placing the Russian Black Sea Fleet on the territory of Ukraine – in our Crimea. In particular, they talked about the conditions of the so-called lease for the fleet, linking the gas issue to this. It seems that there may be some benefit to the state from the feigned discount on Russian gas when the Russian fleet remains on Ukrainian territory. While this fleet was just a cover to capture a territory. An umbrella for issuing passports to our people by Russia – our people in Crimea. For propaganda and creeping annexation, which could only be completed by the invasion, and it happened in 2014. That's what happened in our history. And this is what I advise all our friends, who may become at least one percent more politically dependent on Russia, to avoid. We were the first to see Russia breaking agreements when it simply stopped liking them. We saw Russia turn commercial ties into a chain to keep another state close to it. The Russian Black Sea Fleet was used to capture Crimea. And now it is blocking the sea for us and firing missiles at our peaceful cities. Well, Russia is trying to use gas now to have the entire European continent obedient.   Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear Slovak people! Ukraine has gone through the mistakes that our friends can learn. Russian energy is not just a commodity. It should be abandoned, especially oil, because it's really a question of freedom. Yes, protecting freedom has a price. And the third aspect I would like to talk about today. This is the future of the European Union. Russia's attempts to blackmail, split and weaken Europeans clearly show that all of us on the continent must respond with even greater unity. Even greater integration. Even with greater joint protection of our values. This is an important element of the very force that makes freedom not just a fantasy. Even more unity in Europe is possible only in one case – if Ukraine right now, in the conditions of war, gets a real opportunity to move faster to the European Union. The issue of granting EU membership candidate status to Ukraine in June this year is a matter of protecting the entire European project. As well as the issue of economic support for Ukraine. It is impossible to fight without the economy. And Russia is doing everything to destroy our economy. As an example, most of the Russian missiles that hit Ukrainian land hit the economic infrastructure. Therefore, the priority is to establish alternative routes for our exports, in particular, through the territory of Slovakia. And greater financial support for Ukraine from the European Union. And I ask you to be our voice in the European Union when it comes to defending the relevant positions from the destructive doubts of those who value freedom less than you. After more than two months of the full-scale war, Ukrainians, together with all our friends on the European continent who have shown solidarity in defending freedom, have proved that Moscow will never be able to repeat what it did in 1968 and all other attempts to spread tyranny. By the way, this is how I interpret the decision to award me your State Award of Alexander Dubček. I am grateful for it. But to really fully respond to the mockery of freedom then, in 1968, and to the attempts to mock freedom now, we still have to fight. We must strengthen our unity and put pressure on Russia until we see that victory has been achieved. I know that a donors' conference will be held in Bratislava in June to activate assistance for Ukraine. I am grateful to everyone who participates in its organization, including the GLOBSEC think tank. And I believe that we will be able to discuss specific projects to restore normal life in different regions of Ukraine at this Bratislava site. Because the more actively we cooperate, the more we put pressure on Russia. And the more we strengthen European unity, the clearer the contours of our victory are. Our victory. Thank you, Slovakia! Glory to Ukraine!"
Yermak-McFaul's expert group has developed a roadmap for energy sanctions,2022-05-10T10:51:00Z,"The international working group on sanctions on Russia headed by Andriy Yermak, Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, and Ambassador Michael McFaul, Director of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies (FSI), presented the second document, The Energy Sanctions Roadmap: Recommendations on Sanctions on the Russian Federation. Following the presentation of the Action Plan on tightening sanctions on Russia, an international expert group continued its work and prepared a document detailing energy sanctions, helping governments and companies around the world formulate proposals for sanctions on Russia. The application of energy sanctions should increase the cost of invading Ukraine for Russia and help the Ukrainian state protect its territorial integrity, freedom and democratic values. The authors of the roadmap for energy sanctions point out that Russia's budget is based on revenues from the sale of energy, primarily to European countries. Since February 24, the European Union has paid about $ 800 million daily for Russian oil and gas. The document contains recommendations for political action that will help deprive Russia of this income, minimizing disruptions in markets and the world economy. The expert group supports the decision of the European Commission to impose a total ban on imports of all Russian oil, and substantiates the gradual embargo on gas imports from Russia. In addition, experts provide suggestions, including specific mechanisms, on how to ensure the managed phased implementation of such a ban, while minimizing profits from Russian oil exports during the transition period. Such mechanisms may be considered a priority by individual countries. The case is about a regulated import tax (or tariff) and keeping funds for energy on a special escrow account. Particular attention has been paid to additional sanctions to prevent circumvention of restrictions imposed on the energy sector. In particular, these are targeted sanctions against maritime export service providers bypassing the controlled sales regime. In addition, the roadmap proposes the strategy to prevent the consequences, which makes Europe independent of Russian energy and counters the use of energy resources as weapons. The document also emphasizes the importance of disconnecting Russia from financial flows from gas exports, as Europe pays Russia much more for gas than for oil during the war. The expert group emphasizes that the European embargo on Russian energy should be part of a coordinated strategy of the EU and the United States, which will include synchronous diplomatic steps and cooperation with stakeholders in the private sector. Members of the Yermak-McFaul international expert group call on governments, as well as public and private companies, to take the roadmap as a basis for further public promotion of energy sanctions against Russia to deprive it of the opportunity to finance an unfair war of invasion against Ukraine."
"Russia is the only culprit that peace has been destroyed, and this is its historical responsibility - address by the President of Ukraine",2022-05-09T23:56:00Z,"Ukrainians! Unbreakable people of our country! Today, we have taken another step - a very important and not just a formal step - on our path to the European Union. Ukraine has submitted the second part of the answers to a special questionnaire to be completed by each country aspiring to be part of the European Union. It usually takes months. But we did everything in a few weeks. This is a document that contains thousands of pages. And it was today that I held talks about our European integration with both Charles Michel, President of the European Council, and Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission. I thanked them on behalf of the entire Ukrainian people for their support for our country. For attention to our needs and especially now - in this difficult time of war. They are well aware that this war is not only for our freedom, but also for the freedom of all Europeans. Mrs. Ursula said she was impressed with the speed with which our government officials filled out the questionnaire. And I was glad to hear from her that our speed encourages the European Commission to act just as quickly. We expect to receive a positive response in June regarding the acquisition of EU candidate status by our country. I also thanked the President of the European Commission for the work on creating a Trust Fund for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war, after the victory. And for the efforts needed to agree on a new package of sanctions on Russia. President Charles Michel visited our Odesa today. He saw with his own eyes what the blocked sea means. For the first time in decades there is no usual movement of the merchant fleet, no usual port functioning in Odesa. Probably this has never happened in Odesa since World War II. Ordinary life related to the sea is blocked by Russia. Exactly Russia. And this affects not only Ukraine. Without our agricultural exports, dozens of countries in different parts of the world are already on the brink of food shortages. And over time, the situation can become downright terrible. Politicians are already discussing the possible consequences of the price crisis and famine in Africa and Asia. This is a direct consequence of Russian aggression, which can be overcome only together - by all Europeans, by the whole free world. It can be overcome by putting pressure on Russia, by effectively forcing Russia to stop this disgraceful war. And, by the way, today - despite the presence of the President of the European Council - the Russian military again launched a missile strike at the Odesa region. This is the real attitude of Russia to Europe. And it has always been so. Whatever they say in Moscow. I met in Kyiv with Secretary General of the Council of Europe Marija Pejčinović Burić. We discussed what can be done for peace in Ukraine and Europe with the tools of this esteemed institution. I am grateful for the support of our state by visiting our capital on this day. Europe Day. And Day of Victory over Nazism. Usually on May 9, Europeans recalled the price of peace that was paid by all the nations of our continent 77 years ago. They talked about how to prevent the recurrence of such a terrible war. It is clear that now everything is different. In European capitals, the main topic is the price of peace that will have to be paid to stop the war unleashed by Russia. And also the price for Russia for bringing the evil of total war of destruction of our people to Europe again. I'm sure this is also the main topic in Moscow now. They can show anything in propaganda - let it be. And make any political statements. But the reality cannot be changed. Reality requires peace. And the only culprit that peace has been destroyed is and will be the Russian state. This is a historical responsibility of Russia. Well, we, Ukrainians, continue to work for our defense, victory and restoration of justice. Today, tomorrow and any other day needed for the liberation of Ukraine from the occupiers. I am grateful to all our defenders. I am grateful to all those who defend the Kharkiv region, defend Donbas, defend the south of Ukraine. Who do not give up and are waiting for the Ukrainian flag in all those cities that are temporarily - I emphasize this: temporarily - captured by the occupiers. Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Enerhodar, Mariupol, all other cities, all our other communities. The Ukrainian flag will return. Because this is our country. Free European country. Our state. Glory to Ukraine!"
Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with the Secretary General of the Council of Europe,2022-05-09T19:11:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Secretary General of the Council of Europe Marija Pejčinović Burić. The President noted the rapid and effective response of the Council of Europe to Russia's aggression against Ukraine. The exclusion of the aggressor country from this organization, which promotes the principles of human rights, the rule of law and democracy, testified to the unity of European states in combating tyranny and dictatorship. ""I want to thank you for the fact that the Council of Europe became the first international organization to expel Russia for its actions,"" said the President of Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy discussed with Marija Pejčinović Burić concrete ways to support Ukraine at this difficult time for our country. The parties discussed, among other things, initiatives to establish a group of legal experts to assist the Office of the Prosecutor General, as well as the launch of a new online platform Cities4Cities to support local communities in Ukraine. One of the key issues for our state is the protection of human rights in the temporarily occupied territories. In this regard, the ways of monitoring the situation by the Council of Europe were discussed. ""All gross human rights violations by the Russian occupation administration in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine must be recorded and punished in the future,"" the President stressed. The President called on the Council of Europe to make every effort to stop Russia's illegal deportation of Ukrainian citizens from the temporarily occupied areas and combat zones, and to work with other international partners to ensure the return of Ukrainians from the aggressor's territory."
Obtaining Ukraine's EU membership candidate status is of great importance for the Ukrainian people - President during a conversation with Ursula von der Leyen,2022-05-09T15:46:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a video conference with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. During the conversation, the President announced the transfer of the second part of the completed questionnaire to obtain the status of a candidate for membership in the European Union. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that the second part of the questionnaire was passed to Head of the EU Delegation to Ukraine Matti Maasikas. ""I think these answers are also a small victory for our team. We are waiting for the consideration and conclusions of the European Commission. I would like these conclusions to be positive. And I would like these conclusions to be provided faster thanks to you,” the President of Ukraine said. He stressed that obtaining Ukraine's EU membership candidate status is of great importance for the Ukrainian people and our Armed Forces, which are defending their homeland. For her part, Ursula von der Leyen noted that the European Commission will work hard to review the completed questionnaire submitted by Ukraine to make a decision in June this year. ""I am very impressed with the speed with which you prepared the answers to our questionnaire. This will encourage the European Commission to work faster,"" she said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the European Union for its support to Ukraine. ""I am thankful to you, Charles Michel and the European Union who are actively working against Russia's occupation of part of our territory. Working with sanctions, diplomatically, financially, supporting our state with armaments,"" he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also stressed the importance of adopting the sixth package of EU sanctions against Russia, and thanked those European countries that support the introduction of an embargo on oil and gas from the aggressor country. The President of the European Commission noted that the EU is working on imposing an embargo on imports of Russian oil products. Ursula von der Leyen stressed that today Ukraine is fighting for common European values and democracy, so the EU will continue to provide its support, including financial support. She announced the work on the creation of the Trust Fund for the reconstruction of our country."
President of Ukraine discussed with the President of the European Council support for Ukraine during the war,2022-05-09T15:04:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a video conference with President of the European Council Charles Michel who visited Odesa. The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. The President congratulated the President of the European Council on the anniversary of the victory in World War II and thanked him for the visit to Ukraine. ""I am very pleased that today, at the highest level, the European Union supports Ukraine, at a time when manifestations of Nazism, unfortunately, exist and are being revived. But they should not be spread, and we are doing everything for this together,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. He stressed the importance of preventing a food crisis in the world, which could be caused by Russia's aggressive actions. After all, Russian warships in the Black Sea are blocking the passage of merchant ships to Ukrainian ports. According to the President, our country supplies grain to almost 400 million people on the planet. Blocking the export of Ukrainian agricultural products is already leading to rising food prices in the world. As a result, it could lead to growing famine and political instability in a number of regions of the world. For his part, the President of the European Council who visited the Odesa seaport where the blocked ship with Ukrainian grain is located stressed that wheat should be available to all people in the world so that famine does not spread across the planet. The interlocutors stressed the importance of taking immediate measures for Russia to unblock Ukrainian ports for grain exports. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also noted that in the difficult moment of the Russian invasion, Ukrainians are very grateful for the bold position of Charles Michel and his personal presence in Odesa. ""The European Union supports Ukraine not in words but in deeds. Today, financial support is also very important for us,"" the President said, noting that he counts on the assistance of the President of the European Council in the dialogue with African and Asian countries to support Ukraine. The President of Ukraine also thanked for the sanctions policy of the European Union. He stressed that Ukraine is waiting for the adoption of the next packages of sanctions against the aggressor country. ""I am confident that the EU and the world will not stop at six sanctions packages. But what matters is not the number of these packages, but their effectiveness. I am convinced that the main result is peace on our land and therefore in Europe,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The President also thanked Charles Michel for supporting Ukraine on its path to European integration. ""I want to thank you for your political support, for being here. For the fact that you see Ukraine in the near future equal among other members of the European family,"" he said. For his part, the President of the European Council assured that the European Union will continue to provide maximum financial and defense assistance to Ukraine. The EU has already approved a plan to support our state. “There must be a ""Marshall Plan"" for your initiatives. We must mobilize global support so that you can cope with humanitarian challenges and start rebuilding Ukraine's economy,"" said Charles Michel. He also said that in June the European Council will consider Ukraine's application for EU candidate status. Charles Michel noted that the Ukrainian people today are fighting not only for their homeland, but also for the common European values of democracy and freedom. And the European Union supports Ukraine and is impressed by the resilience and courage of our people."
Address by the President of Ukraine on the Day of Victory over Nazism in World War II,2022-05-09T09:05:00Z,"Great people of great Ukraine! On August 24, 2021, the whole country celebrated the 30th anniversary of our independence! Our soldiers, our defenders, our equipment were moving along the Khreshchatyk, our ""Mriya"" was flying in the sky! ""There is nothing more dangerous than an insidious enemy, but there is nothing more poisonous than a feigned friend."" These are the words of the great Ukrainian philosopher Hryhorii Skovoroda. On February 24, we realized this truth when a feigned friend started a war against Ukraine. This is not a war of two armies. This is a war of two worldviews. The war waged by barbarians who shell the Skovoroda Museum and believe that their missiles can destroy our philosophy. It annoys them. It is unfamiliar to them. It scares them. Its essence is that we are free people who have their own path. Today we are waging war on this path and we will not give anyone a single piece of our land. Today we celebrate the Day of Victory over Nazism. And we will not give anyone a single piece of our history. We are proud of our ancestors who, together with other nations in the anti-Hitler coalition, defeated Nazism. And we will not allow anyone to annex this victory, we will not allow it to be appropriated. Our enemy dreamed that we would refuse to celebrate May 9 and the victory over Nazism. So that the word ""denazification"" gets a chance. Millions of Ukrainians fought Nazism and went through a difficult and long journey. The Nazis were expelled from Luhansk, the Nazis were expelled from Donetsk, and Kherson, Melitopol and Berdyansk were liberated from the occupiers. The Nazis were expelled from Yalta, Simferopol, Kerch and the entire Crimea. Mariupol was liberated from the Nazis. They expelled the Nazis from all over Ukraine, but the cities I named are especially inspiring us today. They give us faith that we will drive the occupiers out of our own land for sure. On the Day of Victory over Nazism, we are fighting for a new victory. The road to it is difficult, but we have no doubt that we will win. What is our advantage over the enemy? We are smarter by one book. This is a textbook on the history of Ukraine. We would not know grief if all our enemies could read and draw the right conclusions. On February 24, Russia launched an offensive. Treading on the same rake. Every occupier who comes to our land treads on it. We have been through different wars. But they all had the same final. Our land was sown with bullets and shells, but no enemy was able to take root here. Enemy chariots and tanks drove through our fields, but it did not bear fruit. Enemy arrows and missiles flew in our skies, but no one will be able to overshadow our blue sky. There are no shackles that can bind our free spirit. There is no occupier who can take root in our free land. There is no invader who can rule over our free people. Sooner or later we win. Despite the horde, despite Nazism, despite the mixture of the first and the second, which is the current enemy, we win, because this is our land. Because someone is fighting for the father tsar, the führer, the party and the chief, and we are fighting for the Homeland. We have never fought against anyone. We always fight for ourselves. For our freedom. For our independence. So that the victory of our ancestors was not in vain. They fought for freedom for us and won. We are fighting for freedom for our children, and therefore we will win. We will never forget what our ancestors did in World War II. Where more than eight million Ukrainians died. And every fifth Ukrainian didn't return home. In total, the war claimed at least 50 million lives. We do not say ""we can repeat"". Because only a madman can wish to repeat the 2194 days of war. The one who is repeating the horrific crimes of Hitler’s regime today, following Nazi philosophy, copying everything they did. He is doomed. Because he was cursed by millions of ancestors when he began to imitate their killer. And therefore he will lose everything. And very soon there will be two Victory Days in Ukraine. And someone will not have even one left. We won then. We will win now, too! And Khreshchatyk will see the parade of victory - the victory of Ukraine! Congratulations on the Victory Day over Nazism! Glory to Ukraine!"
The First Ladies of Ukraine and the United States met in Uzhhorod,2022-05-09T00:11:00Z,"First Lady of Ukraine Olena Zelenska and First Lady of the United States Jill Biden met in Uzhhorod. The visit of the wife of the President of the United States took place as part of her tour of Eastern Europe. Jill Biden has already visited Slovakia and Romania. For security reasons, her arrival in Uzhhorod was kept a secret. ""I am happy that you are here. I would very much like our meeting to take place in my favorite Kyiv. Ukraine is rich in wonderful places, and I would very much like to show them to you. We are in Uzhhorod today. This is a wonderful city that has already sheltered more than 60,000 IDPs,"" said Olena Zelenska, greeting Jill Biden. ""Today you will see people who have lost their homes, peace, security. Today you will be able to feel what these people feel. Temporarily displaced people who have taken refuge in this building live here. There are a lot of such centers in Ukraine now,” she added. The First Ladies visited a school in Uzhhorod, which housed internally displaced persons from the regions of Ukraine where hostilities took place, in particular from the Chernihiv region. Olena Zelenska also invited Jill Biden to facilitate the work of the national program of psychological assistance to the population, which is being implemented under the patronage of the wife of the President of Ukraine. ""Everyone in Ukraine has suffered a psychological trauma. Some people, unfortunately, have become victims of sexual violence, there are people who have seen the murder of their loved ones. Another category is people who have lost their homes and everything they had. And the main category is the servicemen who protect us and who need psychological help,"" she said. According to Olena Zelenska, an interdepartmental working group is currently working to create a long-term platform for psychological assistance, in particular to train psychologists who could work with PTSD - post-traumatic stress disorder. ""We want to adapt and translate from English those programs and practices that already exist in the United States. The United States has a powerful program to combat PTSD. We will be very glad to see its details, we will also be grateful for the financial assistance to this program, because the economy of Ukraine has suffered great losses,"" she said. For her part, Jill Biden said she had visited Ukrainian refugees - children and women - in Romania and Slovakia. ""Many of them are really injured, especially children. I also often heard a question from Ukrainian women: ""Why does he (Putin) want to kill us?"" said the First Lady of the United States. The First Lady of Ukraine also visited the Zakarpattia Regional Clinical Hospital where 32 wounded Ukrainian servicemen are being treated. ""I was able to personally thank them for each day of our safety. And you know what I heard? ""Don't mention it"". These courageous men do not even consider themselves heroes. They say it's their job. That's what they are fighting for - May, Sakura and a baby stroller with a small passenger under a peaceful sky. Anywhere. All over the country,"" Olena Zelenska stressed. The First Lady also thanked Mayor of Uzhhorod Bohdan Andriyiv and Head of the Zakarpattia Regional State Administration Viktor Mykyta for their hard work in settling IDPs in the region."
Ukraine is already a full-fledged part of the free world and a united Europe - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-05-08T23:54:00Z,"Ukrainians! Our defenders. Today is an important day, very important. For us. For our people. For our freedom. It was here, at the Mariyinsky Palace, that I held talks today with my friend, Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau. I am grateful to Justin for visiting our country. Exactly now, exactly on this day. A powerful sign of support and faith in the future of our people. The Ukrainian and Canadian delegations held bilateral talks. We agreed to expand economic and defense cooperation. We have an extremely important decision by Canada to remove all barriers to trade for one year. Thank you, Canada. This agreement was reached in negotiations with Mr. Trudeau and will work in the interests of both the Ukrainian and Canadian people. Among other things, Canada has a strong potential in mine clearance. We expect that this potential will be used in Ukraine - where the Russian occupiers left thousands of mines, tripwire mines, shells. In the presence of Mr. Prime Minister, I awarded our sappers today. In particular, a small but very famous sapper - Patron. A dog who helps clean our land from the traces of the occupiers. And who also helps teach children mine safety. Due to the Russian invaders, this is now one of the most urgent tasks - to teach children to recognize and avoid explosive objects. This is the ""liberation"" from a safe life for Ukrainian children that Russia has brought to Ukraine. For the first time, Ukraine took part in a meeting of G7 leaders. The world's largest democracies. I outlined our vision of what needs to be done for freedom to win and to guarantee Ukraine's security. I called for increasing sanctions on Russia and creating conditions for Ukraine so that the war ends as soon as possible with the liberation of our land and our people. In particular, this applies to the embargo on Russian oil, oil blends and petroleum products. I invited the leading states - our friends - to take part in the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war. We agreed on a joint statement by the G7 on the war, global threats posed by Russia and our respect for the common historical heritage, our common values and the importance of freedom. The statement is in the interests of Ukraine as much as possible and will become the basis of our further cooperation. And the main thing I felt today was the world's even greater willingness to help us. And the fact that we have already achieved a historic result, because it is clear to the whole free world that Ukraine is the party of good in this war. And Russia will lose, because evil always loses. I am grateful to the First Lady of the United States Jill Biden for her visit to Ukraine, to Uzhhorod today. For security reasons, this visit and meeting with the First Lady of Ukraine was not announced in advance, and journalists were not invited. But I know that Mrs. Biden has received as much information as possible about what Ukrainian men and women need now. And I am grateful to her for the sincere support of our people. I held talks with Prime Minister of Croatia Andrej Plenković in Kyiv. Croatia fundamentally and strongly supports our state in the struggle for independence. I am grateful to Croatia for everything we have already received. And I hope that in the future the cooperation will only grow. I also had a meeting with the President of the Norwegian Storting in Kyiv. The conversation was very emotional, so that you feel: they are worried about us, our fate as about themselves. And really try to help. I am grateful for that. I also spoke with the President of the German Bundestag. First of all, about Germany's further defensive assistance in our fight against tyranny. About how German leadership in the European Union can help us. Bono, U2, also visited Ukraine today. I am grateful to him for supporting our people and drawing even more attention to the need to help our people. Well, I am sure that this day in Ukraine has shown that we are already a full-fledged part of the free world and a united Europe. This is an obvious contrast to Moscow's loneliness in evil and hatred that everyone will see tomorrow. The Russian army would not be itself if it did not kill today - on the eve of certainly important days for any European. As a result of the Russian air strike at Bilohorivka, Luhansk region, about 60 people were killed. Civilians who simply hid in the school from the shelling. It was a targeted strike at the school. Another crime of the occupiers. Another missile strike at the Odesa region, again hitting a residential building. Again shelling in the Sumy region. Violent shelling in Donbas and the Kharkiv region. As if today is not May 8. As if tomorrow is not May 9, when peace should be the main word. For all normal people. Russia has forgotten everything that was important to the victors of World War II. But Ukraine and the whole free world will remind it. So that then no one will forget. So that really important words - ""never again"" - which are repeated all over the free world every year on the days of remembrance of the victims of World War II regain their weight again. I am grateful to all our defenders who are defending and saving Ukraine from the modern descendants of that old evil. Eternal glory to all our heroes! Eternal glory to all our warriors! I am grateful to all the friends of Ukraine and freedom! Glory to Ukraine!"
The people of Ukraine and Canada stand side by side in the struggle for freedom against Russian tyranny - Volodymyr Zelenskyy following a meeting with Justin Trudeau in Kyiv,2022-05-08T22:48:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau who is on a visit to our country. During the negotiations, the parties discussed Canada's support for our state in the struggle for independence and territorial integrity, as well as a number of bilateral issues. ""The people of Ukraine and Canada stand side by side in the struggle for freedom against tyranny that Russia is trying to spread,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said during a meeting with media representatives following negotiations with Justin Trudeau. ""The subject of our talks today was what we must do to liberate our territory from the occupiers as soon as possible, to return normal life to all Ukrainians. Canada's defense support for Ukraine was discussed in detail,"" the President said. According to the President, he informed the Prime Minister of Canada about the weapons that Ukraine needs to move faster to victory. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that the Canadian delegation had the opportunity to visit today the suburbs of Kyiv, which was liberated from the occupiers, and see for themselves what destruction Russia leaves on our land. In this context, he called Canada's support for demining the de-occupied territories extremely important. ""The Russian occupiers left thousands of mines, thousands of tripwire mines and shells. They are a threat to our people, our children. And today we have agreed to establish maximum cooperation in this direction, so that there are no such ""exclusion zones"" left in Ukraine, which cannot be entered due to the threat of Russian mines,"" the President said. The Head of State called economic support for Ukraine no less important. ""Post-war reconstruction requires clear, bold, ambitious decisions comparable to the historic Marshall Plan. We agreed to work together to make this a reality,"" he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also noted that negotiations are underway with the Canadian side to lift trade restrictions for Ukrainian exporters, which will greatly help our economy. In addition, the President announced his intention to continue discussions on the abolition of the visa regime for citizens of Ukraine. ""I am grateful to your team, I am grateful to each and everyone who is here with us today in words, in deeds and in personal presence. Together with us at such a difficult time,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy, addressing Justin Trudeau. For his part, the Prime Minister of Canada reaffirmed the unwavering support for Ukraine, including financial and humanitarian support. Regarding arms assistance, he said Canada would provide anti-tank systems, satellite communications equipment and more. ""We will provide everything needed and fund demining efforts,"" he added. The Prime Minister of Canada also assured of further assistance in the abolition of customs duties on imports from Ukraine. He noted that today he visited Irpin and saw with his own eyes the terrible consequences of the Russian occupation. ""Obviously, Vladimir Putin is responsible for his heinous war crimes, and Canada will continue to support Ukraine in this war against Russia. We will stand side by side with you in this beautiful capital, which is full of light, culture and history. We will stay with you for years, decades and centuries to fight tyranny, and Putin and his allies will see that Ukraine will win,"" said Justin Trudeau. He also announced the resumption of the work of the Canadian embassy in Kyiv. At the end of the meeting, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in the presence of Justin Trudeau, presented state awards to Ukrainian rescuers who took part in the demining, using, in particular, Canadian equipment. Among the awarded was the dog Patron who was taught pyrotechnic work by his owner, Major of the Civil Protection Service Mykhailo Iliev. There are already 236 explosive devices found by Patron. In addition, the dog, along with pyrotechnics, is actively involved in mine security education. Children love him especially, and thanks to Patron they perceive information better. ""Today I want to award those Ukrainian heroes who are already clearing our land of mines. And together with our heroes - a wonderful little sapper Patron who helps not only to neutralize explosives, but also to teach our children the necessary safety rules in areas where there is a mine threat,"" said the President of Ukraine."
Speech by the President of Ukraine at the video conference of the G7 leaders,2022-05-08T22:16:00Z,"I would like to thank you for the invitation. Mr. Chancellor, thank you. I am thankful to all the respected leaders for this opportunity and for the fact that it is happening today, on this day exactly. This is a powerful support for our state. Dear friends! We are meeting on this day in such a format to determine what needs to be done to stop Russia's war against Ukraine. Today, May 8, is a key day of remembrance for all the victims of World War II, for the fragility of peace and the inadmissibility of any anti-humanist regimes. But what is remembrance for others today, for our people is, unfortunately, just news, every day. Just yesterday in the village of Bilohorivka, Luhansk region, a Russian bomb killed 60 people. Civilians. They were hiding from shelling in the building of a regular school, which was attacked by a Russian air strike. To do so is to imitate precisely the evil that the Nazis brought to Europe. The missile strikes at Odesa and our other cities are an imitation of how the Nazis tried to bomb and destroy European cities by bombardment. The deportation of more than 500,000 Ukrainians to Russia and the so-called ""filtration camps"" set up by Russian troops in the occupied territories of Ukraine are imitations of the deportations and concentration camps that the Nazis organized in Europe. Every day our people see and die from what must have been left in the distant past. What definitely shouldn't have returned to Europe 77 years after. But, unfortunately, I state: it's back. That is why the solidarity of the whole free world has returned. That is why such historical concepts as ""Lend-Lease"" and ""Marshall Plan"" have returned. I am grateful to the United States and our European colleagues for these initiatives. That is why we are reunited in an anti-war coalition to save democracy and freedom in Europe, to guarantee peace and security. I am grateful to you for this solidarity and for this unification. But what do we need now to gain victory in defending freedom? Freedom of Ukraine and the whole world? First of all, weapons. I am grateful to you for the defensive assistance we have already received. Because, as in World War II, the fate of freedom is decided on the battlefield. So Ukraine must get all the weapons and all the defense equipment that will help defeat tyranny. In particular, the M142 HIMARS, M270 MLRS and other weapons that Ukraine has requested from your powerful states. If we had them, we would have been able to save many people. In all those cities, in all those communities that fell victim to the Russian occupiers, like Bilohorivka, which I mentioned at the beginning, or Mariupol. The second is sanctions. Ukraine will always be grateful to you for unprecedented sanctions in the interests of peace. But the war still continues. Hence, a special international group of experts chaired by Michael McFaul and Andriy Yermak has developed an Action Plan to strengthen sanctions on Russia for this war. It is necessary - I beg you - to implement these sanctions and at least give your feedback. No export-import operations with Russia! As long as Russia is spending the money it has earned on destroying freedom in Ukraine and throughout Europe. The democratic world must be principled in defending itself. We need to look for ways to influence those politicians and those companies that help Russia circumvent sanctions. For example, we transport oil to Hungary through our pipeline. And the politicians of this country not only block the supply of fuel to our territory, but also try to slow down every sanction step against Russia, including the oil embargo. The free world must not allow itself to be manipulated. Also, all Russian officials, law enforcement officials and, importantly, judges who work for tyranny must be on the sanctions list. They are not there yet. Every Russian war criminal must be brought to justice and convicted through international cooperation. Visa restrictions are also needed for Russian citizens so that they do not use the free world for entertainment and shopping. Everyone must fight against tyranny, not adapt to it. The third important point is financial support for Ukraine now and post-war reconstruction. Just as the Marshall Plan played a historic role in rebuilding Europe and creating new conditions for development and growth after World War II, a similar Plan is needed and it is needed now. For the world to see that freedom wins not only on the battlefield, but also in life. As long as the war continues, we need $ 5 billion to $ 7 billion a month in support. When the war is over, we will have to rebuild everything destroyed by Russia for a sum exceeding $ 600 billion. This is a lot for our state. This is not possible for Ukraine. But this is possible for you. And it's not just expenditures for you. Financial assistance to Ukraine and assistance with post-war reconstruction is the prevention of much greater losses of the free world in the future. Russia wants to move on to Europe, and all the potential aggressors in the world, who also want to ruin the lives of their neighbors, are looking to see if Russia succeeds now and if they are able to repeat it. We must organize the work on the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war so that the best experience of democratic countries can be applied with maximum efficiency. In particular, we invite the friends of Ukraine to join the reconstruction, taking patronage over the regions, cities or industries in our country that have suffered from the war, that are destroyed. For example, the United Kingdom has already been invited to take patronage over the restoration of the de-occupied Kyiv region. And today, given Germany's presidency in the G7, I propose to apply the format of cooperation that has shown its effectiveness in the unification of the German state. When it is clearly set who is involved in the restoration and reintegration of the normal life of each region, each city, each community it guarantees efficiency. Such cooperation will strengthen economic and technological ties in Europe and will benefit not only our country, but also your countries, your regions and your companies. I am also grateful to the European Union and the United Kingdom for their decision to abolish tariffs and quotas on our trade. This is a powerful step in support of our state and freedom in general. And this is the decision that would be fair to expect from our other partners. I appeal to all participants of the G7. It is time to remove bilateral barriers in trade. Everything I have said now is, in fact, elements of one question. The question is how long this war will last and how much destruction, how many victims Ukraine will suffer. We must do everything we can to end the war as soon as possible with the victory of freedom. For the longer the war, the greater the benefits of tyranny and the greater the loss of freedom. And not only in Ukraine, but throughout Europe. The lives of more than ten million people in Ukraine who have become IDPs have already been destroyed. But the world is also on the verge of a food crisis because of Russia's actions. The Chancellor also spoke about this now. So how many more millions of lives will be lost in dozens of countries in Africa and Asia as a result of food shortages and political chaos that will follow rising food prices? We need an effective tool for the world's food security. And we propose to create it. If we have an Organization of grain exporting countries that respect international law, value democracy and strive to protect human rights, including the right to life and guaranteed well-being, we will be able to provide food stability and a historic victory over famine. Ukraine is ready to present all the details of this proposal at the appropriate working level. Friends! I commend the efforts of each of you. I am grateful to each of you for the weapons, sanctions and support. But I'm sure you realize that we need more weapons, more sanctions, more support to guarantee the protection of freedom. And to fix security for decades by concluding a relevant effective agreement with clear guarantees for Ukraine. I offer your states - the world's largest democracies - to become guarantors of security for Ukraine. Because this is what guarantees security for the whole center and east of Europe. Therefore, guarantees the confidence of your people that freedom always wins. Thanks again to every country, to every leader present. Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!"
Volodymyr Zelenskyy together with Justin Trudeau took part in a video conference of G7 leaders,2022-05-08T21:50:00Z,"After bilateral talks in Kyiv, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau took part in a video conference of the G7 leaders. The President of Ukraine thanked Olaf Scholz, Federal Chancellor of Germany, who chairs the G7, for organizing this summit. ""I believe that such a summit with the participation of Ukraine today proves that the free world is determined not only to defend freedom, but also to win, as it did 77 years ago. On behalf of the entire Ukrainian people, I am grateful to the leaders of the United States, Great Britain, France, Italy and Japan. I am grateful to the European Union and, of course, to the Prime Minister of Canada for this solidarity with us,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the media representatives after an online speech at the G7 summit. According to him, the G7 leaders agreed on a special summit declaration, which fixed the historical solidarity of the participating countries and their readiness to work together until security and observance of international law for Ukraine and the whole of Europe are restored. Also, as noted by the President of Ukraine, at the G7 meeting, he proposed specific tools needed now by Ukraine and everyone in the world ""who values freedom, democracy and independence."" ""The first is new steps in Ukraine's defense support. Because it is on the battlefield that the fate of freedom in Europe is decided. Secondly, I stressed the need for new sanctions against Russia, as the war on our land continues, which means that the existing sanctions are not enough. Third, we discussed financial support for Ukraine now, when the war continues, and joint work to restore our state after the war. The scale of Russia's current threat in Europe makes the return of concepts such as the Lend-Lease and the Marshall Plan quite natural,"" he said. In the fourth point, Volodymyr Zelenskyy invited all the G7 states to join the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine, using the format of patronage over specific cities, towns, regions and industries affected by the Russian invasion. ""It is this format that can give maximum efficiency to the work on the recovery and create new economic and technological ties within the democratic world,"" said the President. The fifth point of the proposals of the President of Ukraine is to unite efforts to guarantee stability in the global food market. ""We, the grain exporters, are able to do this on the basis of respect for human rights in such a way that there are no more price crises in the food market, so that each country is confident that it is not threatened by famine,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Prime Minister of Canada assured that his country will continue not only to provide assistance to Ukraine, but also to consolidate the efforts of international partners, including in the issue of sanctions. ""On this anniversary of the victory in the war in Europe, we stand side by side and defend freedom, independence and international law. We will continue to impose severe sanctions, reduce our dependence on energy resources from Russia, and fight disinformation from Russia. We will also be there to overcome all of Putin's challenges, including the food threat,"" said Justin Trudeau. The President thanked the G7 leaders for their willingness to work together to protect and strengthen freedom and democracy in the world."

Address by the President of Ukraine on the Day of Remembrance and Reconciliation,2022-05-08T09:05:00Z,"Can spring be black and white? Is there eternal February? Are golden words devalued? Unfortunately, Ukraine knows the answers to all these questions. Unfortunately, the answers are “yes”. Every year on May 8, together with the entire civilized world, we honor everyone who defended the planet from Nazism during World War II. Millions of lost lives, crippled destinies, tortured souls and millions of reasons to say to evil: never again! We knew the price our ancestors paid for this wisdom. We knew how important it is to preserve it and pass it on to posterity. But we had no idea that our generation would witness the desecration of the words, which, as it turned out, are not the truth for everyone. This year we say ""Never again"" differently. We hear ""Never again"" differently. It sounds painful, cruel. Without an exclamation, but with a question mark. You say: never again? Tell Ukraine about it. On February 24, the word ""never"" was erased. Shot and bombed. By hundreds of missiles at 4 am, which woke up the entire Ukraine. We heard terrible explosions. We heard: again! The city of Borodyanka is one of the many victims of this crime! Behind me is one of many witnesses! Not a military facility, not a secret base, but a simple nine-story building. Can it pose a security threat to Russia, to 1/8 of the land, the world's second army, a nuclear state? Can anything be more absurd than this question? It can. 250kg high explosive bombs, with which the superpower shelled this small town. And it went numb. It cannot say today: never again! It cannot say anything today. But here everything is clear without words. Just look at this house. There used to be walls here. They once had photos on them. And in the photos there were those who once went through the hell of war. Fifty men who were sent to Germany for forced labor. Those who were burned alive when the Nazis burned more than 100 houses here. 250 soldiers who died on the fronts of World War II, and a total of almost 1000 residents of Borodyanka who fought and defeated Nazism. To ensure: never again. They fought for the future of children, for the life that was here until February 24. Imagine people going to bed in each of these apartments. They wish good night to each other. Turn off the light. Hug their loved ones. Close their eyes. They dream of something. There is complete silence. They all fall asleep, not knowing that not everyone will wake up. They sleep soundly. They have a dream of something pleasant. But in a few hours they will be awakened by missile explosions. And someone will never wake up again. Never again. The word ""never"" was dropped from this slogan. Amputated during the so-called special operation. They stabbed a knife in the heart and, looking into the eyes, said: ""It's not us!"" Tortured with the words ""not everything is so unambiguous."" Killed ""Never again"", saying: ""We can repeat."" And so it happened. And the monsters began to repeat. And our cities, which survived such a heinous occupation that 80 years are not enough to forget about it, saw the occupier again. And got the second date of occupation in their history. And some cities, such as Mariupol, got the third. During the two years of occupation, the Nazis killed 10,000 civilians there. In two months of occupation, Russia killed 20,000. Decades after World War II, darkness returned to Ukraine. And it became black and white again. Again! Evil has returned. Again! In a different uniform, under different slogans, but for the same purpose. A bloody reconstruction of Nazism was organized in Ukraine. A fanatical repetition of this regime. Its ideas, actions, words and symbols. Maniacal detailed reproduction of its atrocities and ""alibi"", which allegedly give an evil sacred purpose. Repetition of its crimes and even attempts to surpass the ""teacher"" and move him from the pedestal of the greatest evil in human history. Set a new world record for xenophobia, hatred, racism and the number of victims they can cause. Never again! It was an ode of a wise man! Anthem of the civilized world! But someone sang out of tune. Distorted ""Never again"" with notes of doubt. Silenced, beginning his deadly aria of evil. And this is clear to all countries that have seen the horrors of Nazism with their own eyes. And today they are experiencing a terrible deja vu. See it again! All nations who have been branded ""third-class"", slaves without the right to their own state or to exist at all hear statements that exalt one nation and erase others with ease. They claim that you don't really exist, you are artificially created, and therefore you have no rights. Everyone hears the language of evil. Again! And together they acknowledge the painful truth: we have not withstood even a century. Our Never again was enough for 77 years. We missed the evil. It was reborn. Again and now! This is understood by all countries and nations who support Ukraine today. And despite the new mask of the beast, they recognized him. Because, unlike some, they remember what our ancestors fought for and against. They did not confuse the first with the second, did not change their places, did not forget. The Poles didn't forget, on whose land the Nazis began their march and fired the first shot of World War II. Didn't forget how evil first accuses you, provokes you, calls you an aggressor, and then attacks at 4:45 am saying it's self-defense. And they saw how it repeated on our land. They remember the Nazi-destroyed Warsaw. And they see what was done to Mariupol. The British people did not forget how the Nazis wiped out Coventry, which was bombed 41 times. How the ""Moonlight Sonata"" from the Luftwaffe sounded, when the city was continuously bombed for 11 hours. How its historic center, factories, St. Michael's Cathedral were destroyed. And they saw missiles hit Kharkiv. How its historic center, factories and the Assumption Cathedral were damaged. They remember London being bombed for 57 nights in a row. Remember how V-2 hit Belfast, Portsmouth, Liverpool. And they see cruise missiles hit Mykolaiv, Kramatorsk, Chernihiv. They remember how Birmingham was bombed. And they see its sister city Zaporizhzhia being damaged. The Dutch remember this. How Rotterdam became the first city to be completely destroyed when the Nazis dropped 97 tons of bombs on it. The French remember this. Remember Oradour-sur-Glane, where the SS burned half a thousand women and children alive. Mass hangings in Tulle, the massacre in the village of Ascq. Thousands of people at a resistance rally in occupied Lille. They saw what was done in Bucha, Irpin, Borodyanka, Volnovakha and Trostyanets. They see the occupation of Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk and other cities where people do not give up. And thousands of them go to peaceful rallies, which are beyond the power of the occupiers, and all they can do is shoot at civilians. The Czechs have not forgotten this. How in less than a day, the Nazis destroyed Lidice, leaving only ashes from the village. They saw Popasna destroyed. There are not even ashes left from it. The Greeks, who survived massacres and executions throughout the territory, the blockade and the Great Famine, have not forgotten. This is remembered by Americans who fought evil on two fronts. Who passed Pearl Harbor and Dunkirk with the Allies. And together we are going through new, no less difficult battles. This is remembered by all Holocaust survivors - how one nation can hate another. Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians, Danes, Georgians, Armenians, Belgians, Norwegians and many others have not forgotten this - all those who suffered from Nazism on their land and all those who defeated it in the anti-Hitler coalition. Unfortunately, there are those who, having survived all these crimes, having lost millions of people who fought for victory and gained it, have desecrated the memory of them and their feat today. The one who allowed the shelling of the cities of Ukraine from his land. The cities that, along with our ancestors, were liberated by his ancestors. The one who spat in the face of his ""Immortal Regiment"", placing torturers from Bucha next to it. And challenged all mankind. But forgot the main thing: any evil always ends the same - it ends. Fellow Ukrainians! Today, on the Day of Remembrance and Reconciliation, we pay homage to all those who defended their homeland and the world from Nazism. We note the feat of the Ukrainian people and their contribution to the victory of the anti-Hitler coalition. Explosions, shots, trenches, wounds, famine, bombing, blockades, mass executions, punitive operations, occupation, concentration camps, gas chambers, yellow stars, ghettos, Babyn Yar, Khatyn, captivity, forced labor. They died so that each of us knows what these words mean from books, not from our own experience. But it happened differently. This is unfair to them all. But the truth will win. And we will overcome everything! And the proof of this is called ""Werewolf"". This is Hitler's former headquarters and bunker near Vinnytsia. And all that is left of it is a few stones. Ruins. The ruins of a person who considered himself great and invincible. This is a guide for all of us and future generations. What our ancestors fought for. And proved that no evil can avoid responsibility. Will not be able to hide in the bunker. There will be no stone left of it. So we will overcome everything. And we know this for sure, because our military and all our people are descendants of those who overcame Nazism. So they will win again. And there will be peace again. Finally again! We will overcome the winter, which began on February 24, lasts on May 8, but will definitely end, and the Ukrainian sun will melt it! And we will meet our dawn together with the whole country. And family and loved ones, friends and relatives will be together again! Finally again! And over the temporarily occupied cities and villages our flag will fly again. Finally again! And we will get together. And there will be peace! Finally again! And no more black and white dreams, only a blue and yellow dream. Finally again! Our ancestors fought for this. Eternal honor to all who fought against Nazism! Eternal memory to all those killed during World War II!"
Evil returns when human rights and the law are violated and culture is destroyed; this is exactly what happened to Russia - address by the President of Ukraine,2022-05-07T22:41:00Z,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! Last night, the Russian army fired a missile to destroy the Hryhorii Skovoroda Museum in the Kharkiv region. A missile. To destroy the museum. Museum of the philosopher and poet who lived in the XVIII century. Who taught people what a true Christian attitude to life is and how a person can get to know himself. Well, it seems that this is a terrible danger for modern Russia - museums, the Christian attitude to life and people's self-knowledge. Every day of this war, the Russian army does something that is beyond words. But every next day it does something that makes you feel it in a new way. Targeted missile strikes at museums - this is not even every terrorist can think of. But such an army is fighting against us. This is what they want to bring to other European countries. As of May 7, the Russian army destroyed or damaged nearly 200 cultural heritage sites already. Today, the invaders launched a missile strike at Odesa. At a city where almost every street has something memorable, something historical. But for the Russian army, it doesn't matter. They would only kill and destroy. Odesa? Kharkiv region? Donbas? They do not care. Only the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the resistance of our people can stop this inhuman invasion. It's barbarism that has missiles, but has nothing to do with people. Such actions of the Russian occupiers, especially on the eve of the Day of Remembrance of all victims of World War II and the Day of Victory over Nazism, should remind every state and every nation that it is impossible to defeat evil once and for all. Unfortunately, evil tends to return when people disrespect other people's rights, disregard the law and destroy culture. This is exactly what happened to the Russian state. That is why we all have to defend ourselves now. Defend our people, our cities and even our museums, which are becoming targets for Russian missile strikes. I am grateful to the teams of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations for helping us carry out the first phase of the Azovstal evacuation mission. More than 300 people were saved - women and children. Virtually, we evacuated civilians from Azovstal. And we are now preparing the second stage of the evacuation mission - the wounded and medics. Of course, if everyone fulfills the agreements. Of course, if there are no lies. Of course, we are also working to evacuate our military. All heroes who defend Mariupol. This is extremely difficult. But it is important. I'm sure everyone understands the root cause of this complication, as well as where the cause is located. But we do not lose hope. We do not stop. Every day we are looking for a diplomatic option that can work out. Tomorrow, our team is preparing the further work of humanitarian corridors for all residents of Mariupol and surrounding settlements. I held a meeting today on the activities of the executive branch. The main issues are economic. In particular, on providing Ukrainians with fuel. On overcoming the fuel shortage that arose after Russian missiles destroyed our Kremenchuk plant and oil depots across the country. I heard reports on what is being done specifically to organize the supply of sufficient gasoline and other fuel types to Ukraine. The key task for government officials is to speed up the transportation of fuel from European ports to our consumers. The volume of such transportation should increase daily. I also heard a report from the Minister of Finance on the execution of the state budget. We are doing everything to ensure that the state fulfills all its social obligations despite the budget deficit and the deliberate destruction of our economy by the Russian army. The preparation of the Post-War Recovery Plan was also discussed. This is a very large-scale task. But I have no doubt that we will implement it. Today I was in Borodyanka, Kyiv region. Which is gradually returning to normal life. Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak together with Minister of Infrastructure Oleksandr Kubrakov inspected the restored railway bridge over the Irpin River - it is already open for transport. Today we can say that the cities and communities of the Kyiv region liberated from the occupiers are provided with normal transport connections. I also traditionally signed decrees in the evening to award our defenders. 216 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Colonel Oleh Irodiyovych Hehechkora (posthumously), Commander of the helicopter squadron of the 11th separate brigade of the army aviation of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Eternal glory to all who stood up for our state! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
President held a meeting on fuel supply and execution of the state budget,2022-05-07T14:16:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy chaired a meeting on topical issues of the executive branch. It was attended by Head of the Office of the President Andriy Yermak and his deputies, Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal and members of the government. The participants of the meeting first of all considered the issues of fuel security of the country. The President stressed the need to eliminate queues at Ukrainian gas stations. According to First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy Yulia Svyrydenko, work is underway in cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide Ukraine with a green corridor in Eastern European ports, which is currently the main bottleneck in fuel supply logistics. The parties also stressed the need to sign long-term contracts and accumulate state fuel reserves. Minister of Finance of Ukraine Serhiy Marchenko reported on the execution of the state budget under martial law. Thus, the country ended April with a deficit of UAH 125 billion. At the same time, revenues from tax office and customs amounted to UAH 53 billion, which exceeded expectations. UAH 57 billion of revenues are planned for May. According to the Minister, the monthly deficit is planned to be repaid due to international grants and loans. Negotiations on international grants in the amount of 11 billion dollars are underway, of which 5 billion dollars have already been received by our state. The parties also discussed the preparation of a Plan for the Reconstruction and Development of Ukraine after the war. In addition, the Heads of State heard a report on the process of granting Ukraine the status of a candidate for membership in the European Union. Attention was also paid to the issue of cooperation between public authorities and international organizations in providing medical, psychological and social rehabilitation services to citizens affected by Russian aggression."
Ihor Zhovkva met with MPs of countries that are members of the United 4 Ukraine international network ,2022-05-07T09:27:00Z,"Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Ihor Zhovkva met with a delegation of deputies from the parliaments of EU member states and other countries that are members of the informal international network United 4 Ukraine. Ihor Zhovkva informed the participants of the meeting about the security situation against the backdrop of the Russian military aggression. He stressed the urgent need for Ukraine to receive heavy weapons from international partners that can stop the Russian occupation forces. ""I expect that the participants of the meeting will help direct and unite the efforts of the parliaments of the EU member states and other states in supporting Ukraine in this matter,"" said the Deputy Head of the Office of the President. According to Ihor Zhovkva, the strong sanctions pressure of the world community on Russia, in particular the expected introduction of the sixth package of EU sanctions, should deprive Russia of the resources to continue hostilities in Ukraine. ""In this regard, it is also important for Ukraine to maintain the unity of the positions of the European Union,"" he said. In the context of discussing Ukraine's further progress towards EU membership, the importance of granting our country candidate status in the near future was noted. There are very high expectations in Ukrainian society in this regard. Ihor Zhovkva praised the expert role of the United 4 Ukraine members in shaping public opinion about the current situation in Ukraine in their countries and expressed hope that they will continue to support our country to strengthen European security and promote European values."
"Ukraine is defending itself against the onslaught of tyranny, and this struggle for freedom is comprehensible in every corner of the globe - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-05-06T23:35:00Z,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! I wish you health! Today was a busy day, which began and ended with awarding our heroes, our defenders. On the occasion of Infantry Day - a professional holiday of Ukrainian warriors who are the foundation of the army, I met with our servicemen in the morning. Thanked them for their service. Presented awards. Including our new - combat - award. You know that since independence there have been no combat awards in our country. And today I had the honor to finally present such an award. The Cross of Military Merit. And the first person to whom I decided to present this Cross was General Valerii Zaluzhny, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. For courage, for wisdom, for organizing an effective rebuff to the Russian invasion. I am sure the Russian army will remember such a rebuff for a long time. Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Yevhen Moysiuk, combat medic of the 72nd separate mechanized brigade, Sergeant Dariya Mazurenko, Commander of the 14th separate mechanized brigade, Colonel Oleksandr Okhrimenko, Deputy Commander of the mechanized battalion of the 72nd separate mechanized brigade, Captain Vladyslav Kaliyevsky received the same award.  Combat awards are a fair new tradition for the state, which defends its independence on the battlefield. A special award ""For Courage and Bravery"" was also established for combat units that showed extraordinary courage and effectiveness in the battles for Ukraine. It was received by 7 brigades. I also presented the Orders of the Golden Star to our defenders who were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. And also to the relatives of those of our heroes who were posthumously awarded this title. We continue the evacuation mission from Mariupol, from Azovstal, with the mediation of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross. During the day, our team organized rescue for more than 40 civilians - women and children. We hope that soon they will be able to arrive in a safe area after two months of shelling, just underground - in shelters. We are also working on diplomatic options to save our military who still remain at Azovstal. Influential mediators are involved. Influential states. Russian troops continued the shelling of our territory, including missile and air strikes. I ask all our citizens - especially these days - not to ignore the air raid sirens. Please, this is your life, the life of your children. Also, strictly follow the public order and curfew regulations in cities and communities. Be sure to comply with the ban on visiting forests in the territories that were occupied. A great threat of mines and tripwire mines left after the Russian military remains there. I met in Kyiv with the foreign ministers of the three Baltic states. They consistently support our struggle against the Russian invasion. Support from the first day. I am very grateful. And today, as always, we talked thoroughly and for the benefit of Ukraine. We are coordinating our steps to increase pressure on Russia. And this is especially important now - when the European Union is preparing a new, already sixth, sanctions package on Russia. I also took part in a discussion at the very influential British expert platform Chatham House. It is one of the most important international platforms for political work and lobbying - in the good sense of the word - useful government decisions. I have outlined our initiative to update the global security architecture. So that the tools for a really quick reaction to any external aggression finally appear in the world. Addressed the Parliament of Iceland. Thanked the Government and the people of Iceland for supporting the sanctions that are needed to deter Russia. I also called on Icelandic politicians, diplomats and ordinary citizens to help defend our freedom. Urged them to be advocates of freedom. Advocates of Ukraine. Because we have a common freedom with them. Just as with all other nations of the free world. This is the extraordinary strength of the Ukrainian position. We defend ourselves against the onslaught of tyranny craving to destroy everything that freedom gives to people and states. And such a struggle - for freedom and against tyranny - is quite comprehensible for any society, in any corner of our planet. In the evening I signed decrees on awarding our heroes. Our brave defenders thanks to whom Ukraine has survived and is holding on despite everything that Russia is trying to do to break us. Therefore, 203 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded. And 16 servicemen of the Main Intelligence Directorate. Once again, I congratulate all warriors in infantry units on their professional holiday. Glory to all our defenders! Eternal memory to everyone who gave their lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
"Speech by the President of Ukraine in the Althing, the Parliament of Iceland",2022-05-06T20:48:00Z,"Godan dag thetta er Volodymir Zelensky i Kaenugardi! I am grateful for the opportunity to address you today in this format. It is a great honor for me to speak in the Althing, the oldest parliament in the free world. And what else can we talk about now, if not freedom - the most ancient value which people have fought for and continue to fight. Which we are fighting for now in Ukraine. Ladies and Gentlemen! Ukraine and Iceland actually have very close bonds. Our cultures have been well acquainted with one another for over a thousand years. Our ancestors easily found a common language, and this can be traced now in both our and your language. We live in different parts of Europe, in different conditions - natural, economic, and security. But we value the same things - in Kaenugardi and in Reykjavik. Undoubtedly, freedom. The land we rightfully own. And our own culture, which not only shows our identity, separating us from neighboring nations, but also maintains for us and our children a connection with all previous generations. All this in Ukraine is under Russian attack. What will be left of Ukraine if Russia succeeds in its war against our state? The Russian occupiers bring a tyranny that does not allow any freedom. They want to appropriate our land. They have been saying for a long time that Ukraine allegedly has no right to exist independently. And they want to erase any mention of our culture. Despite the fact that our culture has more than 1000-year-old roots! I know how people live in your country. What is remembered the most is your ability to organize social life in an objectively difficult and demanding natural environment so that happiness is felt, so that there is sufficient security for ordinary people, and so that a true democracy works. When we see your cities, your communities, your people, we see just that - how freedom works, how culture works. And what a good result they give on earth. In our part of Europe, natural conditions are objectively easier. More sun, probably more opportunities for agriculture, easier opportunities for contacts between people. We are not threatened by ocean storms and volcanic eruptions. It seems that nature itself here in Ukraine and in the neighboring countries tried to help people. But look at the full-scale war that is going on in our land. Take a look at what the Russian troops are doing. Even in such comfortable conditions, they managed to create hell. For what? This is all outright. For us to never have democracy. So that we never have independence. So that our land, our nature can be used against our interests. So that our resources work for another state. And so that our people are just a silent workforce. Please pay attention to one illustrative fact: more than 500,000 of our people have already been deported to Russia. They were forced to go there. Everything was taken away from them: documents, means of communication. They are sent to remote regions of foreign lands, remote regions of Russia. There is an attempt to assimilate them there. By force! 500,000 deported people. This is a large number. You know that - this is more than the total population of your beautiful country. Extraordinary scale of horror! I'm sure you know about the murder of tens of thousands of residents of our city of Mariupol by the Russian occupiers. I am sure you have heard about the war crimes that the Russian army is committing against our civilians, particularly in our city of Bucha. Wherever the occupiers come in Ukraine, they immediately start looking for everyone who worked for our state. Who served in our army. They are looking for journalists, they are looking for activists. They capture representatives of local self-government. That is, all those who can fight for freedom. On their land, on our land. In order to live freely, as people want, as our people want. Ladies and Gentlemen! It is obvious that Russia's war against Ukraine is not just an attempt to seize one country and destroy life in it. No! This is an encroachment on freedom as such. That is why it is important for all free people of the world that our country is not left alone in the confrontation with Russia. It is important that every nation helps. I am grateful to your people for the steps you have already taken, in particular by supporting sanctions against the Russian Federation. I am also grateful for the support you provide to our country at various levels. But I urge you not to stop. I call on your government, your diplomats and your people to advocate for increasing pressure on Russia. To be advocates of freedom. In all directions. No trade with tyranny. Above all, it is necessary to abandon Russian oil, oil blends and petroleum products. No financial ties with tyranny. No political help for tyranny. It doesn't matter if the country is big or small. When we defend freedom, the contribution of absolutely everyone matters. We in Ukraine definitely believe in victory. We are doing everything to drive out the invaders and liberate our land and our people. I can't tell the date when this will happen. But we are already preparing for the reconstruction of our country. And to ensure a truly free and comfortable life, to guarantee the well-being of our people, we invite our friends and only friends to participate with us in the implementation of Ukraine's reconstruction program. I invite your country, your companies to take part in the reconstruction of Ukraine, in particular in the energy modernization of our state. So that your energy efficiency experience also helps us, our people. I am sure we will be able to start this work soon. But first we will defend freedom. Our common freedom. We will do it. Thank you, Iceland! Glory to Ukraine!"
Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Chatham House,2022-05-06T20:08:00Z,"I would like to greet everyone and you, dear Mr. Robin! Dear guests, dear friends! I am grateful for this opportunity to participate in this discussion. I am also grateful that Chatham House, one of the most influential think tanks in Europe, set up a special program back in 2015 for independent and in-depth research into the Ukrainian context. This research helps find answers to the most pressing questions. And these are the questions I would like to ask today. I know you will ask me questions, there will be a dialogue. But I am sure that each and every one of you is well aware of the level of the problems that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has brought. This is the highest priority for us and, I am sure, for the whole world today. It has brought problems not only to our people, but to everyone on the continent and to everyone in the world. I am absolutely sure of that. This is a full-scale invasion - one that Europe has seen only in the worst times of the 20th century. I would like to briefly outline some of the challenges. The first is the extreme brutality of the Russian army and its people who came here, and the Russian state's extreme contempt for all international conventions, the entire system of international law, human rights - for me, this is the most important thing, the inviolability of borders, the integrity of states in Europe. Why is Russia doing all this? Because they think that if they can be held responsible for such crimes, criminal actions, it will be decades later. They simply do not believe that the international community can hold those responsible for the war crimes to justice as they are hiding behind the nuclear force. The second challenge is, in fact, nuclear blackmail. For the first time in many decades. Absolutely outright. Russian state propagandists on their media resources calculate how long it takes for nuclear missiles to hit European capitals. They talk about it publicly, openly. They tell how to detonate nuclear explosives in the ocean to wash away everything in the British Isles with a radioactive wave. They prepare infographics, that is, they are serious about it. They boast that Russia can destroy any state leaving only ""nuclear ashes"". Moreover, ""nuclear ashes"" is their quote, which they repeat as a mantra. Why is this happening? This is a feeling of impunity, and we are sure of it. They are accustomed to the fact that business ""as usual"" has always returned to the relations of all states with Russia. And even now there are politicians in Europe who are not ashamed of ties with the Russian state after all that the Russian army has done in Ukraine. The third challenge is that the world is a few steps away from political chaos in dozens of countries, which could be the result of food and inflation crises. By blackmailing Europe into launching the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline last year, Russia has provoked a price crisis in Europe. Gazprom deliberately did not supply the market with the necessary amount of gas to cover the deficit, and as a result, gas prices in Europe reached a historic maximum. This has affected all Europeans without exception. Now, as part of a full-scale war against Ukraine, Russia is blocking our ports it has seized. What does this lead to? The global market is left without sufficient supplies of some key products from Ukraine. This is what we have, what is the priority for the world - grain, sunflower oil, corn, other agricultural products. What consequences do we see? I'm sure we don't see everything. Because there is not much analytics here. I think we will see all this in the future. In some countries there is a shortage of sunflower oil. In other countries, the chains of agricultural production connected with our supplies are slowing down. In other countries, a shortage of basic food products is expected. All this together puts pressure on prices. In North Africa, the Middle East, Asia. And then it will affect other regions of the world. And the poorest will suffer. Who always suffers? The poorest. We are sure that the middle class will also suffer. Obviously, the political consequences of this can be dangerous. That is why I say that food security is one of the components of political chaos. Dear attendees! Russia's war against our state, which at first seemed only a bilateral event to many, some even smiled, some said it was just a conflict, Russia says it is a military operation. Now we all evaluate it differently, more seriously. But today is already the 72nd day of a full-scale war, and we do not yet see its end. We do not see or feel the willingness of the Russian side. Just as we do not see comprehensive answers to all the threats posed by Russia. What do we offer? There has not been a day since February 24 when I and our entire team did not negotiate to obtain the necessary weapons. To agree on the necessary sanctions against Russia. To organize the necessary cooperation to document and investigate war crimes. There has not been a day since the beginning of the brutal blockade of Mariupol by the Russian army, this is one of the examples, when we did not try to find a diplomatic solution to rescue people and organize humanitarian corridors for this rescue. We are in contact with everyone who can provide financial support to Ukraine. We have already started preparing a large-scale Recovery Plan for Ukraine, as we have no doubt that we will be able to defend our independence. And we believe in this strength of the world, in our strength. This is not a belief in a miracle. Common sense tells us that the world's response to the aggressor's actions, which Russia is now allowing itself, must be immediate. And what's the reality? We've been talking about the same things for months. For example, the oil embargo against Russia, the blocking of the entire banking sector of the terrorist state. For months we have been fighting for a sufficient supply of weapons. And I am grateful to those states that help us from the first days constantly, every day. Because they correctly assessed the threat. But, unfortunately, not all states have assessed it that way. Even now, not everyone evaluates it that way. Most of Russia-provoked challenges and threats have not been fully addressed. That's the main thing. So, we need new tools, we need to look for them constantly. New determination. Something that can stop not only Russia, but also any potential aggressor. Ukraine proposes to create just such a tool. We call it U24. United 24. By upgrading the global security system, we must create opportunities to prevent any aggression or at least stop it in 24 hours. Or - in 24 hours to provide such assistance to the victim of aggression, which will restore peace. Or - if it is not a war, but a natural disaster or any social challenge - in 24 hours the world community must provide a country or region with all the necessary assistance to save people. With such a global response system, we will be able to ensure that millions of people are never again threatened with physical destruction. Or threats of deportation. Or - famine, destruction. Therefore, here are the specific questions that need to be answered by politicians, experts and society. And the questions I want to ask you now. What exactly can be done to ensure that the responsibility for war crimes is inevitable and comes not after a decade but faster, as in ordinary criminal proceedings? What specific sanctions against Russia can convince Russia, first of all, and all other potential aggressors in the world that international law must be respected? What specific global decisions are needed to keep the weapons of mass destruction in the world under control and to prevent their use and relevant blackmail? Even talks about it. And what sanctions should be imposed for nuclear blackmail or blackmail with chemical weapons? And what will convince the world's politicians that these issues are urgent and practical, and not just for discussion? I hope you will offer your thoughts, answers to these questions. This is your experience. Because objectively, we all need answers, the world needs them. I am sure that every person who watches us now and who asks himself or herself these questions every day needs the answers. And I'm sure that the U24 tool we offer can be an important part of your answers. This is an option. We are talking about this, about our initiative. Because I believe that the more initiatives there are, the more people understand the global nature of these challenges, the global nature of these responses. Thank you very much for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!"
"Defending Ukraine, the leaders of each state defend their country from war as well - Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-05-06T19:39:00Z,"When the world understands that the war in Ukraine is a common war, victory will become common as well. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a video meeting at the Royal Institute of International Affairs Chatham House (UK). ""In order for the world to hear, we need to constantly talk to the world and give concrete examples. Today, Europe and the world are united around Ukraine,"" the President said. At the same time, he noted that not all countries have joined the anti-war coalition, but Ukraine continues to explain the importance of global consolidation, in particular by addressing through the media, social networks and directly to the people. ""There are enough means in the world today to make our voice be heard. The world leaders do not have enough energy,"" the President added. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the leader of each country should powerfully help Ukraine in the fight against the invader, thus helping his or her own country avoid war. ""By defending Ukraine, the leader will defend his or her state. Just like ordinary people who just take to the streets with our flags. And this victory will be common. Victory not over Putin, but over this terror and terrorism, because he and his troops are the face of it,"" the President said. ""When every leader understands this, it will not be my solo - it will be a chorus of powerful leaders who will be able to convey this energy to those societies that are still in doubt and unsure of their choice,"" he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed: it is important to unite the world around the truth. Events in Ukraine should not leave the front pages of the world media, so that people in every country know what is happening in Ukraine every day. ""Because there is a war in Ukraine. And this war is a common one. Therefore, the victory will be common as soon as we understand that this is a common war,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy added."
"If Russian troops destroy people in Mariupol, there will be nothing to talk about with Russia - President of Ukraine",2022-05-06T19:17:00Z,"The possible destruction of the Ukrainian military and civilians who currently remain on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol by the Russian occupiers can put an end to any diplomatic negotiations with the Russian side. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a video meeting at the Royal Institute of International Affairs Chatham House (UK). ""If they kill people who can now be exchanged if they are military, or released if they are civilians, or helped if they are wounded military or civilians, there will be nothing to talk about with them at the diplomatic level,"" the Head of State emphasized. According to him, today, thanks to the efforts of Ukraine, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations, we finally managed to find a format for the evacuation of civilians from the blocked Azovstal plant. The President stated that Mariupol was completely destroyed. According to him, the blockade of the city by the Russian occupiers is a deliberate step, a manifestation of hatred and terrorism. The information and propaganda machine of the Russian Federation is primarily responsible for such cruelty, and this problem still needs to be addressed. ""They nurtured such hatred before the full-scale war. They have been doing this for many years, and now it all results in such tortures,"" the President of Ukraine summed up."
"It is inadmissible to impose sanctions with one hand, and to sign new contracts with the Russian Federation with another - Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-05-06T19:04:00Z,"If you continue to pay Russia for energy, it is only a matter of time before Russian troops cross the borders of the European Union, said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a video meeting at the Royal Institute of International Affairs Chatham House (UK). According to the Head of State, the most important thing in any step, including sanctions policy, is transparency and honesty. ""You shouldn't be a little evil and a little good. It is inadmissible to impose sanctions, and with another hand to sign new contracts with Russia. This is definitely inadmissible in times of war. This is hypocrisy,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. According to the President of Ukraine, Russia earns a billion dollars a day on energy. ""Don’t play. If you understand that you cannot do without this energy, then say that you will be able to do without it in two months, reach an agreement. Do not make exceptions for individual countries, act together. This is the essence of a united EU, this is the essence of the phrase ""European Union"",” the President emphasized. According to him, the sanctions should be such that there is no need to renew them after implementation. If a decision is made to disconnect from the SWIFT system, it must be applied to the entire banking system of the Russian Federation. The President of Ukraine thanked the European Union, the United States and the United Kingdom for their sanctions policy. At the same time, in his opinion, sanctions against Russia should have been applied preventively. He expressed confidence that the European Union would eventually decide on a full embargo on Russian energy. ""It will be difficult for everyone, but all European families will be alive. Unlike ours. But if some European leaders do not do this, they will understand later when Russian troops will be on your borders. When the first missile flies, as it was with us, you will understand,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy added, emphasizing that no Nord Stream is worth people's lives. The President also drew attention to the fact that the Russian authorities are gradually implementing all their threats. ""When politicians say they will reach Germany, it is their thoughts, their dreams. When the EU is weakened and, God forbid, Ukraine falls, they will come to Germany. It is a matter of years. Their generations will be ready for this because of information policy. And, believe me, they will justify all their shameful steps,"" the Ukrainian Head of State stressed."

He kept the strength of the infantry,"" he recalled.

In addition, Volodymyr Zelenskyy presented the first military awards of independent Ukraine - the Cross of Military Merit introduced by decree of the President.

We have a great heroic legacy and, consequently, traditions of military awards,"" he said. Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Valerii Zaluzhny, who from the beginning of Russia's armed aggression successfully organized the defense of the state and personally led the heroic resistance of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to this invasion, became the first Knight of the Cross of Military Merit.

They must be as effective as possible. We must not allow the aggressor to circumvent them and continue to finance the criminal war against Ukraine."""

"Address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the participants of the Brave Ukraine Charity Event, the people of Great Britain and the people of Ukraine",2022-05-05T23:58:00Z,"Unbreakable people of the bravest country! Usually I address Ukrainians at this time and in the same way every night, when I summarize the events of the passing day. Every night - from the first day of this full-scale war of Russia against our state of Ukraine. Every night I report to the public on what has been done to protect the state. On what the Armed Forces of Ukraine managed to achieve. On how we help our people. And on what international negotiations took place. For example, today one of the notable news was the news of my conversation with you, Boris. Every time such negotiations take place, it is important for my country, for Ukraine. And no less important, I'm sure, for Britain. Because it is about steadfastness, courage and about the leadership that we demonstrate together - the Ukrainian and British nations. In defense of freedom. Our common freedom. Russian troops today, as every day during this war, have continued to bomb our cities and our people. For example, my traditional morning meeting with the military, with the leadership of the army, with government officials and diplomats was accompanied by the sound of an air-raid siren. This is our reality. Missile strikes every day. The day before yesterday - on the day when you, Boris, addressed our parliament, the Russian army launched 15 missile strikes at Ukraine. And this can be called a certain ""Russian compliment"" to your brilliant speech and our fruitful interstate cooperation. Because yesterday there were only 7 such strikes. Obviously, Russia is annoyed by our proximity - Ukraine and Britain. So this means that we are really strong in defending freedom in Europe. In general, during this war, the Russian army has used 2014 missiles against Ukraine already. 2682 appearances of Russian fighter jets in our skies have been recorded. Each of these ""arrivals"" is the death of our people, the destruction of our infrastructure. If we take only the medical infrastructure, to date, Russian troops have destroyed or damaged almost 400 health facilities. These are hospitals, maternity hospitals, outpatient clinics. In the temporarily occupied areas of Ukraine - in the east and south - the situation with access to medical services and medicines is just catastrophic. Even the simplest medications are missing. Russia has brought to Ukraine and Europe such problems that we could not have imagined a few months ago. This is in fact a complete lack of treatment for cancer patients. This is an extremely difficult or impossible access to insulin for diabetics. It's the inability to perform surgery... It's just a lack of antibiotics! These are the consequences of the Russian occupation for a part of our land, for a part of our people, which we must liberate from the invaders. And we will definitely do it. In particular, due to your support. Today the rescue operation from Mariupol was continued. With the assistance of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross. People are on their way to safe territory. More than 150 people from Azovstal and more than 300 people from Mariupol and its suburbs who were evacuated by the humanitarian corridor this week are already receiving all the help they need. Medical, document renewal, financial assistance, communication with relatives, friends and families. Currently, Russian shelling and assault of Azovstal do not stop. But civilians still need to be taken out - women, children. Many children who are still there. Just imagine this hell! And there are children! More than two months of constant shelling, bombing, constant death nearby... We expect an effective regime of silence. We are doing everything to find a solution to save our military. Heroes who defend Mariupol against the occupiers prevailing in the number of troops. There are different units there. They have many wounded. But they do not give up. They are holding positions. We do not give up either. Every day, the whole team is looking for an option that will ensure the safety of these people. And I am grateful to everyone who helps. To all those who offered mediation and are making efforts to save Ukrainians. Today I addressed the participants of the high-level donors' conference held in Warsaw. It is also an element of our protection, an element of protection for the whole of Europe. Because it is not only on the battlefield that the fate of our state and the future of the continent is being decided now. But also in the economic field, in the field of readiness of world leaders to unite to rebuild Ukraine after this war and give stability and security to the center and east of Europe. We have the result. It has been announced that $ 6.5 billion has been raised at this conference. And this is good. But this is only part of what is really needed to restore normal life throughout the territory where Russia has brought the war. That is why we need a modern analogue of the Marshall Plan for Ukraine. Stronger participation of the free world and international institutions is needed. I spoke about this today at the conference. However, we call for the cooperation and support of each and everyone. Everyone for whom freedom matters. That is why United24 was launched today - a global initiative that will unite people from all over the world around the desire to help Ukraine. And I invite you to join this initiative! The initial component is a platform of the same name to raise funds to support our struggle. United24. Its main goal is to increase donations to Ukraine. Just a few clicks - and everyone can join the direction that they find most useful right now and for themselves. Because Ukraine needs up to $ 7 billion a month to cover the state budget deficit. In total, it has been calculated that already more than $ 600 billion is needed to rebuild what the Russian army destroyed. Just imagine this scale! That is why every manifestation of support, every sincere help to Ukraine is important. In particular, yours today. Ladies and Gentlemen!  Friends! If everyone in the world - or at least the vast majority - were steadfast and courageous leaders as Ukraine, as Britain, I am sure we would have already ended this war and restored peace throughout our liberated territory for all our people. But we still have to fight. Fight. As you, Boris, said, addressing our Verkhovna Rada the day before yesterday, we are still writing one of the most victorious chapters in our history. And now we can assess the significance of this chapter, in particular, by the following fact: 11,672 of our defenders have already been awarded state awards for courage and effective defense of Ukraine. In a little over ten weeks. 11,672 people. And a few minutes before this address, I signed a decree awarding another 286 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is on the shoulders of these brave warriors and their brothers-in-arms that Ukraine and, to be honest, the whole of Europe are now standing. And I thank you for your really effective support of this struggle. Bravery is rightly believed the first of human qualities as it guarantees all others. Thank you, Britain! Thank you, Boris!  Thank you all! Glory to Ukraine!"

Andriy Yermak noted the partnership cooperation between Ukraine and the United States. ""In this difficult time, we understand who our friends and strategic partners are. And, of course, the United States plays an extremely important role in supporting Ukraine,"" he said.

""And, of course, we are waiting for President Biden,"" Andriy Yermak added. The Head of the Office of the President stressed that despite significant support from the United States, Ukraine needs more weapons, as the war continues and the whole world sees the situation in the southeast of our country, including Mariupol. According to him, negotiations with Ukraine's partners take place daily at all levels. ""People's lives in Mariupol depend on how quickly we get help. We ask everyone: please save our people, children, wives,"" he said, adding that the time is running out and it's a matter of days already. In addition, special attention is paid to the sanctions policy. The Head of the President's Office stressed that it is important for sanctions to be effective. A special international expert group has been set up for this purpose. Andriy Yermak also noted the work with partners on security guarantees for Ukraine, which should not be a repetition of the Budapest Memorandum. ""Ukraine wants to be sure after the war that this will not happen again. The second Budapest Memorandum is completely inadmissible. We hold daily consultations with our partners on the security future of Ukraine… These should be clear, legally fixed commitments, guarantees,"" he said.

That their families stay alive and that our cities are not completely destroyed,"" Andriy Yermak emphasized.

Damon Wilson noted the struggle of Ukrainians and the support of the United States for Ukraine's efforts in this struggle. ""Ukraine is creating history, its democratic future right now. The American people support Ukrainians in their struggle for freedom and democracy. And the whole Congress, our people, the whole American politicum stands together with Ukraine. We will do everything possible to support the Ukrainian people so that Ukraine wins this war, de-occupies its territories and restores peace,"" he said."
Andriy Smyrnov discussed with Amnesty International delegation the establishment of special international tribunal on Russian crimes,2022-05-05T16:43:00Z,"Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Smyrnov met with a delegation of the international non-governmental human rights organization Amnesty International led by Secretary General Agnès Callamard. Agnès Callamard stressed that Amnesty International seeks to focus the attention of as many countries as possible on the problem of the war in Ukraine. In particular, the organization plans to interact with representatives of the media and civil society. The Deputy Head of the Office of the President noted that Ukraine needs strong support from the international community in documenting war crimes committed by Russia in our country. According to him, the International Criminal Court is already working on the cases in which evidence of Russian crimes during the war in Ukraine is being investigated, but the inevitability of punishment for top officials of the aggressor country must be inevitable. Andriy Smyrnov stressed the importance of establishing a special international criminal tribunal, which will be able to quickly assess the evidence of crimes of Russian aggression against Ukraine. ""Active multi-level consultations are underway at various international platforms on the need to establish and launch a mechanism for such a tribunal,"" said the Deputy Head of the Office of the President. He noted that last week the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted two resolutions calling for the establishment of an international tribunal. ""Ukraine's representation at the level of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice and the President's Office is involved in the negotiation process with allied countries, with which the model and forms of operation of such a tribunal are being discussed,"" Andriy Smyrnov said. ""Given the obvious signs of aggression, all the evidence that the civilized world has seen, the horrible crimes committed by the aggressor country - Russia, in my opinion, the assessment of this fact should be given as soon as possible. And the entire military-political leadership of the aggressor country must bear severe and unavoidable responsibility for this,"" he stressed. The Deputy Head of the Office of the President noted that among the issues being discussed is also the location of such a tribunal. ""We are in favor of it being located in Ukraine. In Bucha, Irpin, Borodyanka or in Kyiv. Ukraine is ready to provide full technical and organizational support for the work of such a tribunal,"" Andriy Smyrnov said. He stressed that the new tribunal should not be overburdened with a large number of powers in order to avoid conflicts of jurisdiction with other international judicial institutions. However, time must show how quickly the existing international institutions will be able to assess the convincing evidence of Russia's war crimes against Ukraine and its citizens. ""Ukrainian society, its citizens tortured by Russian war criminals, all those who have endured any form of suffering as a result of Russia's war against Ukraine, destroyed Ukrainian business - all are waiting for answers to these questions. And this legal assessment must be given within a reasonable time. Both politically, in a global context, and legally - in the judiciary,"" said the Deputy Head of the Office of the President. Andriy Smyrnov also informed the Amnesty International delegation about the work of Ukraine's judicial system in wartime. During the meeting, Amnesty International representatives presented the President's Office with a vine sapling. Human rights activists said the plant was brought from the Syrian region, which was completely destroyed by the Russian army. This is a gift from the Syrian people, which supports the democratic aspirations of Ukrainians. Andriy Smyrnov noted that he would personally hand over the vine sapling to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy."
Speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the High-Level International Donors' Conference in Support of Ukraine in Warsaw,2022-05-05T15:15:00Z,"Ladies and Gentlemen! After ten weeks of the full-scale war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, our meeting in this format and for this purpose proves that Ukraine, Europe and the whole free world are on the way to a common victory. Our state retains full functionality. Our continent is united. Millions and millions of people around the world support us to make tyranny lose. The Armed Forces of Ukraine and all our heroic defenders bravely and firmly defend freedom on the battlefield. But how this brutal war will end is decided not only on the battlefield. But also in the aspects of economy, finance, humanitarian support, the ability to ensure a normal life in the territory free from the enemy, in rebuilding what was destroyed by the Russian army. Freedom must demonstrate that it protects and provides for people better than tyranny, which has enjoyed a massive flow of money for oil, gas and other raw materials for decades. That's how freedom will win. That is why this conference is important for everyone in Europe. Both strategically and tactically important. First. Sufficient financial resources are needed so that Ukrainian men and women are provided with everything they need while the war continues. The Ukrainian state, as the administrator of these funds, will ensure all urgent needs - both defensive and social and humanitarian. Second. We are already preparing a large-scale Recovery Plan for Ukraine after the war and need a strategic international support plan for Ukraine that will be a modern analogue of the historic Marshall Plan. It is money, technology, expertise and growth opportunities that are needed to return to a secure life, to modernization and to social development. It will be an investment in the stability of the whole of central and eastern Europe. So that the aggressor knows that it will not break the power of Europe and all free nations. And so that everything destroyed by the war is rebuilt at a high level. The reconstruction of Ukraine must now become the same historical example for our time and for the future as the restoration of European countries after World War II. And such free world's investments, if they are fast, if they are sufficient, will mean that millions of our people who became IDPs because of this war will be able to return home. We offer our partners - civilized and responsible states - to take patronage over those regions, over those cities, over those industries of Ukraine that have suffered from the war waged by Russia. Take patronage to work with us to rebuild these regions, our cities, towns and industries. Such a patronage project can create a new and equally historic example of interaction and partnership between the free world, between the regions, cities and companies of Europe and democratic countries. Third. Ukraine’s quick movement to the European Union is needed through its candidate status, which must be granted right now - in conditions of war. As part of a special shortened procedure for EU membership. Because this war of Russia against Ukraine was planned as a prelude to a strike at a united Europe. Greater unification is a powerful answer. That is why Ukraine's membership in the European Union must be an absolute reality. Not just promises, not just prospects, but practical steps. I know we are ready for these steps. And you know it, too. And I am sure that most of you, European leaders, are also ready for this. Ladies and Gentlemen! I am very grateful to Poland and Sweden, to Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson for organizing this important high-level donor conference. I am very grateful to President of the European Council Charles Michel and to President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen for their leadership, which makes Europe a true defender of the most important thing - freedom. I am grateful to all the participants of the Conference for being with us in this war for a free and democratic life for millions of people. Not only for Ukraine. But for all of us who may be threatened by tyranny. I believe that Europe will show its strength today. You will show your strength. In particular, international institutions - UN institutions, whose representatives are here with us now and can be even more effective. Because this is for our common freedom. Thank you for your attention. Glory to Ukraine!"

All funds will be directed to the accounts of the National Bank of Ukraine assigned to the relevant ministries. Fundraising reports will be provided by the NBU every 24 hours. The ministries will report on the allocation and distribution of funds once a week. The Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Infrastructure are responsible for the effective use of donations. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov has been appointed responsible for United24's activities by the government. Deloitte Ukraine, a consulting and auditing company that is part of the international Deloitte network, is joining the United24 platform. One of the world leaders in the industry, one of the ""big four"" audit companies, will quarterly review the consolidated report of all ministries.

Remembering the victory over Nazism means never really allowing what the Nazis inflicted on Europe again - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's address,2022-05-05T00:45:00Z,"Ukrainians! Today I will start with a story about one person. About Oleksandr Makhov - a well-known journalist. I'm sure you've seen his reports on Ukraine and Dom TV channels. You may have seen his comments, his posts. He has always been like that - with his own position. Patriotic and sincere. And always without vanity. And he was always among the bravest, among the first. He always worked in the hottest spots. Tried to bring true material. Powerful material. In 2017, he was the first Ukrainian journalist to visit our station in Antarctica. When COVID came, he was not afraid. He has lived in Sanzhary for two weeks, where Ukrainians were brought to from China. From the first day of the full-scale war, he was on the frontline. Volunteer. ATO veteran. Warrior of the 95th assault brigade. Born in the Luhansk region. He had a special feeling of what this war means. Today he died in the Kharkiv region, in the battles near Izium. He was 36 years old. My sincere condolences to relatives and friends. Let his son Vladyslav know: Russia will bear responsibility for this death. We will definitely gain victory for Ukraine. I'm sure it was Oleksandr's dream. And we will make it come true. Eternal memory to him and to all our heroes who gave lives for Ukraine! The second stage of our evacuation operation from Mariupol was completed today. 344 people were rescued - from the city and its suburbs. That's how many people departed to Zaporizhzhia today. Our team is getting ready to meet them. Meet in the same way as more than 150 people whom we managed to take out of Azovstal. They all receive the necessary help. All of them will receive the most caring treatment from our state. I am grateful to all those who make the evacuation operation successful: Iryna Vereshchuk, Andriy Yermak, David Arakhamia, UN representatives, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and everyone who reached an agreement and provided silence and corridors for the people. We are negotiating and hope to continue rescuing people from Azovstal, from Mariupol. There are still civilians. Women, children. To save them, we need to continue the silence. The Ukrainian side is ready to provide it. It takes time to just lift people out of those basements, out of those underground shelters. In the current conditions, we cannot use special equipment to clear the debris. Everything is done manually. But we believe that everything will work out. I spoke today with UN Secretary-General António Guterres. About what has already happened. What we still have to do to save Mariupol residents and defenders of the city. There was not a day when I didn't do it, when we didn't do it. And I am grateful to everyone who helps. I spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Bennett. I congratulated him on the Independence Day of the State of Israel. We talked about the situation in the east of our country and especially in Mariupol. We also discussed the scandalous and completely unacceptable statements of the Russian Foreign Minister, which outraged the whole world. I spoke with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. We agreed on the next diplomatic steps needed for peace. We discussed how to bring to justice all war criminals. Every Russian soldier and every commander who killed, tortured and tormented our people. Today, the Russian invaders launched another missile strike at our cities. At Dnipro, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia. At the cities of Donbas and other regions of our country. All these crimes will get proper answers. Both legal and quite practical - on the battlefield. I addressed the people of Denmark today on the occasion of Liberation Day. The Nazis were expelled from this country 77 years ago. Every year in May, all Europeans, all decent people on earth recall this feat - victory over the worst evil in human history. Victory in the war against Nazism. But to recall means not just to remember. This means remembering and really trying to never allow what the Nazis did to Europe again. It is the Ukrainians, together with our friends and partners - the anti-war coalition, as the anti-Hitler once was - that are repelling those who have forgotten exactly why people rejoiced in 1945. Because if everyone in Russia really remembered, this war simply would not have started now. Traditionally, before delivering the evening address, I signed a decree awarding our defenders. 35 servicemen of the 19th missile brigade of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. I am grateful to all our heroes! To all who stood up for our state. Glory to Ukraine!"
Address by the President of Ukraine to the Danish people on the anniversary of the liberation of Denmark from the Nazis,2022-05-04T23:51:00Z,"Dear friends! Danish people! Today you celebrate the anniversary of the day that was a dream. It has long been a dream of freedom and peace. This dream has become a reality. Five years. It was on this day that the five long years of Nazi occupation of your country came to an end. They lost. And freedom won. Life won. Denmark and the whole world then celebrated and hoped that such a brutal war would be the last and that no one would want to destroy peace anymore. They hoped that there would be no more feeling of mortal danger. That people can get rid of military habits. They hoped to forget forever about the light masking that was required. They hoped that air-raid sirens would no longer sound to report the real threat. That they can be turned on only once a year to remember the war that took place. But the war came again. It is here and now. It is in Ukraine. And it is not going to stop on our land. And it has already become as brutal as that war, the victory in which we all remember every year in May. I remember addressing you and the Folketing on the 34th day of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. I said then that Russia used 1370 missiles against our country. Today - already 1993 missiles. Just imagine how many lives they took. Most of them hit non-military targets. Then, on March 29, I told you that the Russian occupiers had destroyed 773 educational facilities in our country. And today - twice as much. 1584. These are kindergartens, schools, universities. This is what the Russian army is fighting against in Ukraine. The invaders have already killed 220 Ukrainian children. And we do not yet know for sure the situation in the occupied territories. But when I spoke to you last time, there were 144 names on the list of children killed. You see these terrible numbers grow. There were 144. Now - 220 children killed! They did not even have time to feel what life is like. The Russian state is not yet ready to stop the war. They still dream of capturing Ukraine and other European countries. They still dream that freedom in Europe must disappear. But their dreams must not come true. The dream of peace must come true. Our and your dream. Just like it was 77 years ago. Right now in Ukraine it is being decided how people will live on our continent. Whether there will be peace. Not only for us, but also for our neighbors, for you and us. Evil does not know what state borders are. Tyranny never stops at capturing just one country. You are already helping us fight. We are grateful to you. Fight with weapons, with your ""yes"" vote for our accession to the European Union, with honesty in the issue of sanctions and with sincerity towards our people. The sea of Ukrainian flags here today, the sea of flags on the streets of your cities shows that you understand everything. No one will now say how many more days this war, unleashed by the Russian Federation, will last. But I believe that our Liberation Day is approaching. I believe that just as I am addressing your people now, when you celebrate the anniversary of the liberation of your country, your representatives will address the Ukrainian people as we celebrate the anniversary of our peace. Now, as every year, you light candles across the country in memory of that war and victory over evil. And I ask you, when you see the warm light of candles, remember, please, about Ukrainian children. About those 220 children whose lives were taken by this war. Remember that Europe can do its best to keep this horrible list of children killed from growing. Never again. I am grateful to each and every one of you! Thank you, Denmark! Glory to Ukraine!"
President of Ukraine had a phone conversation with the UN Secretary-General,2022-05-04T21:42:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy had a phone conversation with Secretary-General of the United Nations António Guterres. The President thanked the Secretary-General personally for his efforts to evacuate Ukrainian citizens from Azovstal. Volodymyr Zelenskyy informed António Guterres about the successful completion of the first stage, during which 121 people were evacuated from Azovstal, and expressed hope for a successful continuation of the ongoing evacuation operation. The President of Ukraine thanked the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross, which demonstrated the possibility of making progress in the most difficult humanitarian crises. ""The whole world has learned about the role of the UN and the ICRC in this. This has shown that international organizations can be effective,"" the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also appealed to the UN Secretary-General to assist in the evacuation of all the wounded from Azovstal. ""The lives of the people who remain there are in danger. Everyone is important to us. We ask for your help in saving them,"" the President said."
"President: Now we need to push Russian troops out of our territory as much as possible, but we all want Ukraine to return to internationally recognized borders",2022-05-04T13:46:00Z,"Today, the top priority is the maximum expulsion of Russian troops from the territory of Ukraine, but the global goal is to restore the territorial integrity of our state within internationally recognized borders, because this is what all Ukrainians want. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during his participation in the session of the Wall Street Journal CEO Council Summit. ""The goal of every Ukrainian is to restore our territorial integrity within internationally recognized borders. I understand that everything at once is impossible. First, appropriate steps must be taken to stop the war, and then diplomacy will be in place,"" the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that the first stage in this war was to stop Russia's advancement. ""The second stage is to make Russia withdraw troops from our territory as much as possible. The third stage is to restore territorial integrity as much as possible,"" he explained. According to the President, where it is possible to restore territorial integrity through dialogue, Ukraine will do everything possible, but only as an equal partner. ""We understand that it will be difficult to restore territorial integrity on the temporarily occupied Crimean peninsula. And yet, I believe that we will be able to move to the diplomatic path after showing our strength. Because any war ends with diplomacy,"" the Head of State is convinced. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that the main guarantee of victory is confidence in the Ukrainian people and the Armed Forces of Ukraine. ""And we are not retreating. That is, today is a new stage already. Somewhere, in some territories, we are blocked by the Russian military and equipment. There, we are waiting for the appropriate equipment to appear on our side, so that we can push and move forward. And in some areas we are moving forward already,"" he said. However, the President noted that he has not yet seen Russia's desire to cease fire. ""When both sides want a ceasefire, they do it. We’ve seen that for several years with the Russian Federation on the touch line in Donbas. They say that we are negotiating, then they violate (ceasefire agreements - ed.)"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Head of State pointed out that even when it comes to the regime of silence in the territory of Mariupol for the operation on the evacuation of civilians held jointly with the UN, shelling and bombing still take place. Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that a ceasefire can be established only when he meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""If we have a meeting with President Putin, then there will be a ceasefire for the time of the meeting. Because otherwise there will be no meeting. And then, perhaps, we will agree with him personally. He must personally commit to a ceasefire. And preferably do it publicly,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. At the same time, the President of Ukraine noted that the ceasefire does not mean that Russian troops can stay where they are now and there will be some frozen conflict. ""We will not agree to a frozen conflict,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy summed up."
Russia and every other potential aggressor must see that by war you will not achieve anything - Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the session of the Wall Street Journal CEO Council Summit,2022-05-04T13:17:00Z,"The world's effective response to Russian aggression is the most realistic possible safeguard against other wars in the future. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a speech at the session of the Wall Street Journal CEO Council Summit. The Head of State stressed that Russia had launched a full-scale war against Ukraine, hoping that the democratic world would not dare to react in a consolidated way for peace. But the Russian leadership was wrong. ""Ukraine's courage, the willingness of our friends and partners to help, the principled reaction of the nations of Western countries, as well as the willingness of many companies to care for their own reputation have led to Russia gradually becoming an increasingly isolated state. And business is increasingly isolated,"" he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that after the victory of Ukraine, in which he has no doubts, the world must forever abandon the preservation of relations - both political and business - at any cost with those who do not respect international law and do not recognize treaties, which they sign. ""Russia is gradually approaching the understanding that it is profitable to respect international law. That to fulfill contracts is correct. Therefore, the effective reaction of the world to Russian aggression is the most realistic of the possible safeguards against other wars in the future,"" said the President of Ukraine. According to the Head of State, several important steps need to be taken to restore the rule of law in the world. ""The first is the complete isolation of the aggressor, first of all economic. The second is sufficient help for Ukraine to endure this war, the struggle for freedom and our rights. The third is the reconstruction of what was destroyed by the war. When these three things happen, both Russia and every other potential aggressor will see that war does not help achieve anything,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. He is convinced that working with a terrorist state inevitably results in tens of thousands of casualties, hundreds of billions of dollars in losses and destabilization of markets. Therefore, it is necessary to leave the Russian market. The President stressed that only the food crisis alone provoked by Russia threatens political chaos in dozens of countries. Ukraine has suffered about $ 600 billion of losses in damage and destruction since the full-scale Russian invasion. Today, the state budget needs support of up to $ 7 billion a month, the President said. ""So we need direct help both to the government and to the citizens. For example, through the instrument of military bonds. Or through an account in our National Bank, through which we make payments to our citizens. By helping us, you are helping yourself in the future. Because this help is for the sake of stability and freedom. Hence, for the sake of growth,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. At the same time, according to him, Ukraine's victory will not be convincing if we do not rebuild what has been destroyed. “The biggest contribution you can make to our reconstruction is the opening of your representative offices, divisions and your productions, companies, offices and branches in Ukraine. Exactly in Ukraine, it is important. In our country, you will have access not only to our market of 40 million people, but also to the entire EU market,"" the President said, recalling the EU's decision to abolish duties, quotas and anti-dumping tariffs on Ukrainian exports. ""We have already shown the greatest example of heroism in defending our common freedom and common values. And immediately after our victory, we will demonstrate the same example of creating the best conditions for doing business in Europe, so that you are comfortable with investing in our country,"" said the President. According to him, all this should become part of the new economic order in Europe and a new impetus for global economic growth."
"Andriy Yermak discussed security issues and strengthening sanctions against Russia with advisers to leaders of the United States, Great Britain, Germany and France",2022-05-04T09:47:00Z,"Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak held a video conference with National Security Advisor to the President of the United States Jacob Sullivan, National Security Adviser to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Stephen Lovegrove, Foreign Affairs Adviser to the German Chancellor Jens Plötner, Adviser to the President of the French Republic on relations with Ukraine and Russia Isabelle Dumont, other representatives of the French side. Andriy Yermak informed his interlocutors about the course of events on the frontline noting that the most difficult situation remains in the south-east of Ukraine, where Russia has concentrated significant forces. He also spoke about the evacuation mission from the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol in the Donetsk region. According to the Head of the President's Office, on Tuesday 156 Ukrainian citizens who took refuge from the Russian bombing in the basement of the Azovstal plant finally reached Zaporizhzhia and are now safe. At the same time, according to Andriy Yermak, Russian troops continue to shell Azovstal, which still shelters civilians and wounded soldiers in need of emergency medical care. The humanitarian situation in Mariupol remains catastrophic. The Head of the President's Office stressed the need to make every effort to unblock the people at the plant. As part of the ongoing dialogue, the parties continued to discuss future security guarantees for Ukraine. Our state, which has faced Russian aggression, is interested in obtaining clear and concrete guarantees. The parties also discussed preparations for the next sanctions package against Russia. The action plan to strengthen sanctions developed by the Yermak-McFaul international expert group was handed over to Ukraine's partners. The interlocutors agreed that sanctions pressure on Russia should increase until it ends the aggressive war and seeks peace."
"Striking at Ukrainian cities, Russia is trying to vent its powerlessness, because it cannot beat Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-05-03T23:56:00Z,"I wish you health, Ukrainians! Our defenders! We finally have the result, the first result of our evacuation operation from Azovstal in Mariupol, which we have been organizing for a very long time. It took a lot of effort, long negotiations and various mediations. Today 156 people arrived in Zaporizhzhia. Women and children. They have been in shelters for more than two months. Just imagine! For example, a child is six months old, two of which are underground, fleeing bombs and shelling. Finally, these people are completely safe. They will get help. And I am grateful to all those on whom the rescue of these people depended. Who agreed and who helped. I am grateful to everyone who ensured the physical transportation of people through the humanitarian corridor. Of course, we will continue to do everything to get all our people out of Mariupol and Azovstal. It's difficult. But we need everyone who stays there: civilians and military. There was not a day when we did not address this issue, when our people did not try to solve this issue. Yes, we managed to achieve a ceasefire for almost three days in order to make the humanitarian corridor work. Currently, Russian troops are not adhering to the agreements. They continue massive strikes at Azovstal. They are trying to storm the complex. But I have been told many times that no one can be saved. That it is impossible. And today 156 people are in Zaporizhzhia. This is not a victory yet, but this is already a result. And I believe that there is a chance to save our other people. Apparently, the Russian military has reacted extremely nervously to our success today. Various Ukrainian cities have once again become targets for Russian missiles and Russian strikes. Lviv, Vinnytsia, Kyiv region, Dnipropetrovsk region, Odesa, Kharkiv region - such a scale of today's shelling clearly does not indicate that Russia has any special military purpose. Strike at Zakarpattia? What exactly can it give Russia? They are trying to vent their powerlessness. Because they can't beat Ukraine. But they can - so far - burn children's attractions in Gorky Park in Kharkiv or destroy a bridge. Or a grain warehouse or a house with people. The more such strikes, the farther Russia is from civilization. From what is called civilizedness. Today we also have another tragic news. A terrible road accident took place in the Rivne region. A bus, a car and a fuel truck collided. As of this time, 17 people died. But there may be more casualties. My sincere condolences to all those who lost their loved ones. I commissioned to provide all the necessary assistance to the victims. I am grateful to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the great friend of Ukraine, Boris Johnson, for his support of Ukraine and our defenders. Today Boris addressed our parliament and our people. These were very important words, warm, friendly, powerful. This is a very sincere gesture. I am also grateful to Britain for the new package of support for our country, which the Prime Minister announced today. I also addressed the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine today. For the first time during a full-scale war. I emphasized the main thing - and the main thing not only for me, but also for the whole of Ukraine. I am sure we must maintain maximum unity. Because our success depends on unity. Not only political success, but also the defense of the state, the strength of our people, our society. I continued the very useful practice of addressing the parliaments of our partner countries. Today (addressed - ed.) the Parliament and the people of Albania. Thanked for the support, including defensive support. Noted the cordiality with which the people of Albania support our people. Other such addresses are also planned. I also spoke with representatives of the largest global companies - in the CEO Wall Street Journal club (this is a very influential club. Three trillion dollars is the total turnover of companies whose leaders are in this club). About how to put pressure on Russia to end the war. About how to rebuild Ukraine after the war together. About what the post-war model of the Ukrainian economy can be. I believe that such economic diplomacy is one of our most important tasks. I spoke today with Polish President Andrzej Duda. I congratulated him and the entire Polish people on the national holiday - the Constitution Day of Poland. We discussed further cooperation, concrete steps and support for our defense. I informed him about the current situation in the areas of hostilities. About what is happening in Mariupol. About the evacuation of Ukrainians. And about what else we can do together to help protect our state and our common freedom - freedom of Ukrainians and Poles, all Europeans. Traditionally, before delivering the address, I signed decrees awarding our heroes. 185 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, two of them posthumously. Two more of our defenders were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. Eternal glory to all our heroes! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for our state! Glory to Ukraine!"
Volodymyr Zelenskyy had a phone conversation with Andrzej Duda,2022-05-03T20:53:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy had a phone conversation with President of the Republic of Poland Andrzej Duda. The President of Ukraine congratulated the leader of Poland and all the fraternal Polish people on the 231st anniversary of the Constitution of May 3, which is celebrated today. ""Democratic values and traditions, the pursuit of justice unite our states and people. Today we feel the strong leadership support of Poland in the selfless struggle of the Ukrainian people for the protection of European values. We appreciate it!” the President of Ukraine emphasized. Volodymyr Zelenskyy informed the President of Poland about the course of the resistance to the aggressor on the frontline, about the tragic situation in Mariupol. The interlocutors discussed further defense assistance to Ukraine. The Ukrainian Head of State especially noted Poland's significant contribution in this direction. The leaders paid special attention to further sanctions pressure on Russia, which should be intensified and expanded. ""Russia has already started an energy war against Poland and the whole of Europe. EU states must get rid of energy dependence on Russia,"" the President of Ukraine stressed. Volodymyr Zelenskyy informed his Polish counterpart about the beginning of the work on the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine. In this regard, he thanked Poland for the initiative to hold a high-level International Donors' Conference for Ukraine together with the Government of Sweden and the leadership of the European Commission, which will be attended by Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. The President of Ukraine noted the key role of Poland in supporting Ukraine's movement towards EU membership and expressed confidence in the prompt adoption of all necessary decisions by Brussels. During the conversation, the leaders touched upon the issue of comprehensive assistance provided by the government and the people of the Republic of Poland to millions of Ukrainians who have found temporary shelter from aggression in the neighboring country. Volodymyr Zelenskyy especially thanked Andrzej Duda and his wife Agata for their personal support. The President of Ukraine also invited the President of Poland to address the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine."
Speech by the President of Ukraine in the Parliament of Albania,2022-05-03T16:03:00Z,"Dear Mrs. Speaker of Parliament! Dear Mr. Prime Minister! Dear ladies and gentlemen, deputies! The people of Albania! Yesterday, Muslims around the world celebrated Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting for Islam. And I congratulate you on this holiday. I wish you what all Ukrainian men and women wish for each other - peace. During this month, the Muslims of Ukraine and our entire society have not seen a single calm and peaceful day. That's how we live after February 24. Exactly like that. Russia has turned all our days into a mortal danger. Yesterday, a 14-year-old boy died as a result of a missile attack on our Odesa, our southern city. A 17-year-old girl was also wounded. Every day we have such a reality. Every day Ukrainians lose children because of Russian strikes. And more than 600 children have fallen victim to this Russian invasion. 220 children were killed and 406 were injured. Today is a farewell ceremony for journalist Vira Gyrych who was killed by a Russian missile at her home in the capital of our state, Kyiv. The missile hit her house. An ordinary multi-storey building near the downtown of the capital. The Russian army is firing at our cities and villages with artillery and aircraft. Does not spare missiles. In our largest city in the east of the country, in the city of Kharkiv, a fifth of all houses was destroyed. This is more than two and a half thousand houses. They were burned, destroyed or damaged by Russian shelling. Once one of the most developed cities on the shore of the Sea of Azov - the city of Mariupol - is completely destroyed. There are no undamaged buildings. None, imagine! This half-million city has been under siege by the Russian army since early March. They didn't allow water, food, medicine - nothing and no one. And they didn’t stop bombing it. This is literally a scorched city. But you can take any Ukrainian city or village where the occupiers came and there will be very similar messages. About destruction and about murders. About tortures. About forced deportation of people to Russia. About total looting of everything on our territory. Older people who survived two occupations - the Nazi occupation during World War II and now the occupation by the Russian army - say they did not see such atrocities 80 years ago. Now they saw the Russian military shooting children in the face. Now they saw ordinary people - peasants who had been taken prisoner - being forced to lie on the ground day and night in sub-zero temperatures. It turns out that the Russian troops have a special method of ""fighting"" the escape of prisoners in the cold season: they are forced to pour water into their shoes, put the shoes on and lie on the ground in the cold. People stopped feeling their feet, their toes froze. But the occupiers did not even allow them to stand up, let alone to warm up. In the areas liberated from the Russian army, we constantly find graves of tortured people. They have their hands tied, traces of shots on their arms and legs, and broken ribs. Many were shot in the back of the head. Often the occupiers did not even allow the bodies of those killed to be buried. Bodies are found in forests, fields, basements, wells. Retreating from our land, the Russian army left the dead just on the streets as well. Russia was offered to cease fire at least on Orthodox Easter. There was no answer. It was also offered on Pesach - there was no answer. Russia has also ignored the sanctity of the month of Ramadan. Just think about it: 86 religious sites were destroyed or damaged by shelling. These are churches, mosques, houses of worship. The Russian army is not trying to protect even the facilities of the Russian church from its shelling! This is a complete abandonment of morality. Complete rejection of universal values. Complete non-recognition of life as an unconditional value. And they do not want to stop in Ukraine. They want to go further. In an attempt to revive the worst-level tyranny seen in the twentieth century, Russia has become the greatest threat to the entire free world. And I am grateful to every nation that is fighting this tyranny with us. Because only if we stop Russia now in Ukraine will we be able to save Europe from the coming of a new era - the era of non-freedom. Save it from what your people had to go through, in particular. Ladies and Gentlemen! The people of Albania! I am grateful to you for not hesitating who to support in this struggle. You are definitely on the side of freedom and truth. Thank you for concrete steps for Ukraine. For defense assistance. For supporting sanctions on Russia. For taking care of our people and hosting our children, especially in Durrës. This attitude of yours towards Ukrainian men and women in difficult times reminds me of St. Mother Teresa. An Albanian woman whose life has become a symbol of humanism for everyone in the world. She taught people that good daily efforts can defeat evil and bring them closer to the holiness that people will remember from generation to generation. I believe that by working together with all Europeans in this way - by our daily good efforts, we will be able not only to stop this war waged by Russia, but also to protect Europe in the future from the recurrence of such a threat. As the sixth package of sanctions against Russia's aggression is being discussed in the European Union, we must all insist that it includes an oil embargo and a real blockade of any schemes that Russia uses to deceive the free world and ignore sanctions. Russian banks must be completely disconnected from the global financial system. However difficult it may be, it is necessary to deliberately restrict trade with the Russian Federation. Because if not today, then tomorrow Russia will consciously use trade ties to hit your market when it wants some political concessions from you. You need to deprive it of this tool in time. I ask you to close the ports for Russian ships. And limit the arrival of Russian tourists. Because you can never know who came to you... Maybe the killers who were in Bucha? Or maybe the tormentors of Mariupol? Or maybe someone who is already working to undermine your country? I am grateful to Albania for its cooperation within the United Nations platform. Especially now when your country is a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council. We need to do a principled thing and stop using UN funds to sponsor Russia. If it violates the UN Charter, threatens the world's food security and destroys peace in Europe, it has no right to receive a single cent from the UN. Since 2014, when Russia seized our Crimean peninsula and started the war in Donbas, the UN has purchased goods and services from it for at least two and a half billion dollars. This is simply unfair. Wrong. Decades ago, Ukraine and Albania chose the path of democracy and European integration. We did not deviate from this path. Together we are committed to the development of freedom and a united Europe. And I believe that when the time comes to decide on Ukraine's accession to the European Union, your vote will be able to sound in our support. I am sure that right now everyone in the world is showing their true character. Someone is big in size, but very small when you have to be bold. And someone is small on the map, but its cordiality is one of the greatest. Thank you, Albania! Thank you for your support. Thank you for your cordiality. Glory to Ukraine!"
Andriy Yermak discussed with American businessman Kimbal Musk support for Ukraine during the war,2022-05-03T15:23:00Z,"Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak held a video conference with American businessman, member of the Board of Directors of Tesla and SpaceX Kimbal Musk. The meeting was also attended by Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov. On behalf of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and all Ukrainians, Andriy Yermak thanked Kimbal Musk and his brother, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, for supporting our country during the difficult times of the war. ""We highly appreciate this real support for Ukraine during this terrible war with Russia. We are grateful for the high-speed Internet thanks to Starlink (terminals - ed.), which we received from you. Very grateful! Everyone knows what a great role you have played in this assistance,"" said the Head of the President's Office. Kimbal Musk stressed that it is a great honor for him to help our country, because today Ukraine is fighting for democracy against tyranny. ""We are with you. Thank you for fighting so bravely,"" he said. Andriy Yermak informed the American businessman about the situation in Ukraine. He said that currently the largest number of troops is concentrated in the southern and eastern regions of our country. The Head of the President's Office also reminded of the catastrophic situation in Mariupol, which is blocked by the Russian military, and told about the process of evacuation of the city's residents. He also noted the importance of assistance provided to Ukraine by partner countries during the war. Andriy Yermak invited Kimbal Musk to visit Ukraine at a time convenient for him. The Head of the President's Office noted that the American businessman may be interested in projects developed by talented Ukrainian IT specialists. ""I'm sure you will really like the capital of Ukraine, and we will be able to talk in detail about possible joint projects,"" said Andriy Yermak. During the meeting, projects and areas of cooperation that could involve Kimbal Musk's company and American business in general were discussed. The Head of the Office of the President informed the interlocutor about the project of post-war reconstruction of Ukraine, in particular about the initiative of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to involve partner countries in the reconstruction of settlements affected by the war.

Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Verkhovna Rada,2022-05-03T15:11:00Z,"Dear Mr. Prime Minister! Dear Mr. Chairman! Dear people's deputies of Ukraine! Ladies and Gentlemen! First of all, I would like to thank the leader of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, and all the people of the United Kingdom. For the words we hear. For the actions we see. For the support we feel. For the help we actually receive. For the victory that we will definitely gain together! On October 8, 2020, our countries became strategic partners. And on February 24, 2022, we proved that our partnership is not on paper. Our partnership is on the battlefield. In the battles for common ideals, battles for a common future. It has been almost ten weeks since the Russian Federation declared full-scale war against them and invaded our beautiful Ukrainian land. During this time, Ukraine and Britain have gone a path from partners to friends and brothers. And the one who lied that he is a friend and a brother has gone a path from a neighbor to an occupier and a terrorist. Is it sad? Yes. Is it scary? No. Because these almost ten weeks have proved: it is not scary when such an evil enemy is against you if such a good friend is next to you. Such as Great Britain. And leader Boris Johnson. And these words are not flattery, not courtesy, they are reality. We are together. Almost every day. We are in touch. Daily. If we don't have a conversation today, it means only one thing: we are busy with what we agreed on yesterday. And it is so almost all these weeks, all this difficult time. For the sake of one goal, one moment - the first second of victory. And for the sake of one epoch - the epoch where peace reigns. In Ukraine, and therefore in Europe, and therefore in the world. I would like to thank the United Kingdom, which is bringing this moment closer with us and which is ready to guarantee our security. And this gratitude of mine is not a formality. Because I know that the guarantees of Great Britain will never be a formality for Ukraine. Because these almost ten weeks have proved that your word is solid and your actions are decisive. Without any ""almost"". I hate that word - ""almost"". As well as our interaction and support of British allies. First of all, it is a weapon and equipment for our military, which protects both Ukraine, Europe and the whole world from the Russian occupiers. I will not voice all the details to the public - let it be an unpleasant surprise for the aggressor every day. Instead, I can speak openly about all other forms of support. This is humanity. And help for our refugees and internally displaced persons. Medicines, food, ambulances and fire engines and other large humanitarian aid. This is justice. And assistance in the investigation of war crimes of the Russian Federation in Ukraine. This is resilience. Macro-financial assistance for our economy. This is the abolition of customs duties, the abolition of quotas for our bilateral trade. This is the reconstruction of our land, this is the reconstruction of Kyiv and the Kyiv region, which will be joined by Great Britain. These are important global things. Sanctions against the Russian Federation, energy embargo, asset blocking. These are ordinary, very simple human, but no less important, symbolic things. Blue and yellow flags on Trafalgar Square and Downing Street. When we are supported by London, Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast, supported by Liverpool, Manchester and hundreds of other cities in this great state. When Ukraine is supported by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Sir Paul McCartney, Elton John and Sting. Richard Branson, Joanne Rowling, the Beckhams, Benedict Cumberbatch, Queen, Pink Floyd, Deep Purple. Ed Sheeran, Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry, Kit Harington, Emilia Clarke, Daniel Radcliffe and, of course, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. It is also very important - the return of Melinda Simmons, and the recent visit of Prime Minister Johnson. At a very difficult time and at a very necessary moment. Our walk in the streets of Kyiv showed the world that the heart of Ukraine feels. Pain. But the people we met there, their words, their eyes, smiles and gifts - already famous roosters, the same as in Borodyanka - all this showed the world what our Ukrainian soul feels. Indomitability. Unbreakability. Therefore, hope for victory. Today, I, our parliament and the entire Ukrainian people can say one thing: thank you, Britain! Thank you, friends! Dear people's deputies of Ukraine! Please agree, when there is such unity in this hall, it is priceless! During these almost ten weeks, I have addressed the House of Commons, the US Congress, the European Parliament, the Bundestag, the Knesset, the Seimas, and many other parliamentarians and parliaments. But I did not address you. And this is not contempt, on the contrary - it is a great trust in you. You are here. And you know very well what is happening in our country. We are all citizens of this great state, and you know exactly what to do. I believe that has not changed in these almost ten weeks. I will be happy if the following becomes obvious and indisputable for you. You are the people's deputies of the greatest state in the modern world! I'm sure of it! You are the people's deputies of Ukraine. Keywords are ""people"" and ""Ukraine"". I think we will abandon trifles, political speculation until peacetime, although it is better to abandon them forever. The agenda of the Verkhovna Rada is obvious. The keyword is ""order"". Because there is no time for spam, quarrels and PR - everyone already knows you. I think wise rationalism and sound nationalism are important. All this is very important for us today. You are part of a large Ukrainian army. Your frontline is a legislative field in which you must work for our people, for each of us, for our state, for our victory. Like our army, like the whole country. Work 24/7. No days off, no unnecessary emotions, slogans, etc. Today we all have one party, and this party is Ukraine. One faction - Ukraine. One majority - Ukraine. One, strong, independent. And everything that does not help it or, God forbid, harms, weakens or splits, must be not in the minority, no. This must be a thing of the past. Just like someone's hopes of sitting out somewhere. Currently, the absence of a deputy is justified by only two things: his work abroad or in the regions for the interests of our state or his death for the interests of the state. The rest is of no interest to Ukraine today. It doesn't need anything else, it won't have anything else! Anything else follows the Russian warship! Please do not waste time on unnecessary laws. There are important priorities for the state. I know that you are professionals, you will do it. The state is waiting. Please do not waste your time, my time, the time of the people of Ukraine on minor initiatives and unimportant things. It seems to me that laws should be as timely as Lend-Lease. Accurate as our ""Stugna"" and ""Bayraktar"". And bring benefits like ""Neptune"". And glory like our army. And to be such that will go down in history like the people of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
"The whole free world has united so that no one justifies Nazism, kills children or destroys peaceful cities as Russia does - address by the President of Ukraine",2022-05-02T22:51:00Z,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! The 68th day of our strong defense is coming to an end. The 68th day of self-destruction of Russia. Self-destruction in every sense of the word. If this country once had what is called a reputation, now Russia does things on a daily basis that simply preclude any adequacy. Yesterday, for example, Russia's foreign minister openly and without hesitation said that the biggest anti-Semites were allegedly among the Jews themselves. And that Hitler allegedly had Jewish blood. How could this be said on the eve of the anniversary of the victory over Nazism? These words mean that Russia's top diplomat is blaming the Jewish people for Nazi crimes. No words. Of course, there is a big scandal in Israel today as regards these words. However, no one hears objections or excuses from Moscow. There is silence. Hence, they agree with what their foreign minister said. After the Russian missile attack at Babyn Yar in Kyiv, after the Menorah damaged by shelling at the site of the mass executions in Drobytsky Yar near Kharkiv, after the deaths of ordinary people who survived the Nazi occupation and Nazi concentration camps from Russian shelling, such an anti-Semitic thrust by their minister means Russia has forgotten all the lessons of World War II. Or maybe they never studied those lessons. So the question is will the Israeli ambassador stay in Moscow knowing their new position? Will relations with Russia remain as usual? Because it's not accidental. The words of the Russian foreign minister - a ""great connoisseur of Hitlerism"" - are not accidental. It is no coincidence that the Russian occupiers are creating so-called ""filtration camps"" on Ukrainian land through which thousands of our Ukrainian citizens are passing. Where our people are killed, tortured and raped. It is no coincidence that the occupiers capture civilians and take them hostage or deport them as free labor. It is no coincidence that they are waging a so-called total war to destroy all living things, after which only the burned ruins of entire cities and villages remain. To do this, one must completely reject the moral and achievements of the victors of Nazism. But if such people are in the Russian leadership, it does not mean they can judge others in Europe or in the world according to themselves. If they send tens of thousands of their citizens to die in a foreign land and do not even take the bodies of those killed from the streets, roads, fields, it does not mean that everyone else is like them. If there are people among them who come from Ukraine but support the extermination of Ukrainians and everything Ukrainian, it does not mean that everyone else has abandoned normal human morality. Today, Russian troops launched another missile strike at Odesa. Destroyed the dormitory. A 14-year-old boy was killed. A 17-year-old girl was wounded, she has a shrapnel wound. What is it? For what? What did these children and the dormitory threaten the Russian state with? And that's how they fight. That's all. A gymnasium founded over a hundred years ago burned down in Lysychansk, Luhansk region, due to Russian shelling. It was built by the Belgians for this city. It withstood two world wars. But, as we see, this gymnasium turned out to be a terrible threat to modern Russia. 220 Ukrainian children have been killed by the Russian army since February 24. And we still don't know about everyone, because we don't have access to the temporarily occupied areas of our state. 1570 educational institutions were destroyed or damaged by shelling. It's in a little over two months! That is why the whole free world united so that no one justifies Nazism, kills children or destroys peaceful cities as Russia does. Today in Kyiv I met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Denmark. We discussed the whole range of issues of our bilateral relations, especially defense, financial and political cooperation. I see progress in implementing the agreements reached during the talks with the Prime Minister of Denmark. I am grateful. I received good signals. Plans to rebuild Ukraine after the war were also discussed. And support for our movement towards the European Union. I am grateful that Denmark resumes the work of its embassy in our capital. This is already the 29th foreign mission that returned to Ukraine. We are working on new sanctions against Russia. We expect a new package from the European Union in the near future. This package should include clear steps to block Russia's energy revenues. We truly believe in this. So that the terrorist state is not given a billion euros a day for fuel. But it is also worth preparing for the next sanctions steps now. In any case, we will have to block all export-import operations with Russia. Because that's what they make money on in Moscow. And they do not even understand that international law and peace in Europe must be respected. We continue to do everything to save our people from Mariupol. The evacuation operation continues. Tomorrow we also expect movement through humanitarian corridors from Berdyansk, Tokmak, Vasylivka. The Armed Forces of Ukraine heroically repel the occupiers' attempts to advance. Kharkiv direction, Donbas, the south of the country - everywhere the situation remains extremely difficult. But I am grateful to each and every one of our defenders who are holding the defense. I have just signed a large decree to award our military. 438 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Senior Lieutenant Dmytro Ruslanovych Todorov for his personal courage and extraordinary efficiency in the battles against the occupiers in the Donetsk region. Eternal glory to everyone who stood up for our state! Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
Ihor Zhovkva met with ambassadors of EU member states who returned to Kyiv to perform their duties,2022-05-02T19:56:00Z,"Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Ihor Zhovkva held a working meeting with representatives of the European Union member states who have resumed their diplomatic presence in Kyiv. Among them are the Ambassadors of Spain, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Germany, Slovakia, as well as Chargé d'Affaires of Estonia, Poland, Slovenia, France and the Czech Republic in Ukraine. Ihor Zhovkva thanked the heads of diplomatic missions of the European Union who returned to Kyiv to fulfill their duties: ""This demonstrates your firm solidarity with the people of Ukraine who oppose Russian aggression."" He commended the continued political support and significant practical assistance provided by the governments of these countries since the first day of the large-scale Russian invasion. In this regard, the Deputy Head of the Office of the President stressed the importance of the visits of European leaders to Ukraine and expressed hope that the number of such visits will continue to grow. Ihor Zhovkva also thanked the EU countries for the important humanitarian aid and support for Ukrainian citizens who were forced to leave their homeland due to Russian aggression and found refuge thanks to our European partners. The Deputy Head of the Office of the President stressed the need to increase EU sanctions on Russia in order to encourage it to immediately cease hostilities and liberate the temporarily occupied territories. ""The sixth package of sanctions must be implemented as soon as possible. It must contain an embargo on Russian oil, disconnect all Russian banks from SWIFT and stop the broadcast of Russian TV channels in the EU,"" said Ihor Zhovkva. The parties focused on steps aimed at Ukraine's accession to the EU as soon as possible. ""Granting Ukraine the status of a candidate country for EU membership as soon as possible should be a symbolic step of support from the leaders of the EU member states. Today, Ukraine is defending not only itself but the whole of Europe, and hence proved its belonging to the European Union. Ukraine and Ukrainians deserve this decision,"" said the Deputy Head of the Office of the President. He also noted that due to Russian aggression and the systematic destruction of critical and social infrastructure, there is an urgent need to launch the Trust Fund for Solidarity with Ukraine as soon as possible. Ihor Zhovkva also informed about the initiative of President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy to involve partner countries in the reconstruction of certain cities and regions affected by the war, and called on representatives of EU member states to actively decide on such assistance."
President of Ukraine met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Denmark,2022-05-02T18:57:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Denmark Jeppe Kofod. The Head of State noted that Ukraine highly appreciates the support of Denmark, and reminded that he had a fruitful meeting with Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen in Kyiv recently. ""It is important that the cooperation between our countries is really dynamic and fruitful,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed and praised the resumption of the work of the Danish Embassy in Kyiv. The President stressed that Ukraine now needs maximum defense assistance. ""I know that Denmark has already done a lot in this matter and continues to do so,"" he said. The Head of State stressed the importance of coordinated counteraction to the aggressor on the sanctions track. According to him, Ukraine appreciates Denmark's active position on EU restrictive measures against Russia and looks forward to Copenhagen's continued active role in sanctions pressure. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also expressed his belief in Denmark's support for Ukraine's path to EU membership. The parties paid considerable attention to the issue of financial assistance to the economy of our country. The President praised the readiness of the Danish side to play a leading role in the reconstruction of Mykolaiv together with other international partners. The President noted the assistance of the Danish government in clearing and rebuilding the liberated Ukrainian cities by transferring the relevant construction equipment. The given step is one of the results of an agreement reached during recent talks with the Prime Minister of Denmark. The parties also discussed further joint work on bringing the aggressor to justice for crimes committed in our country."
Head of the President's Office in an interview with CNN: Ukrainians continue to fight for victory - to regain control of all our territories,2022-05-02T12:30:00Z,"For Ukraine, progress in the negotiations would be Russia's decision to end the war and deoccupy Ukrainian territory. This was stated by Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak in an interview with Fareed Zakaria on CNN. Commenting on the negotiation process with Russia, Andriy Yermak noted that the position of our state is transparent and clear: “Ukraine did not start this war. Ukraine did not occupy someone's territory. Ukraine has never been an aggressive country, in particular it has not shown aggression towards Russia. The most important thing for us is our independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. We are fighting for this. For our lands and freedom."" According to the Head of the Office of the President, the progress in the negotiations would be a decision to stop the war and withdraw Russian troops from the territory of Ukraine. He confirmed that the majority of Russian troops is now concentrated in southeastern Ukraine, especially in Donbas. The whole world also knows what is happening in Mariupol, where there is a catastrophic situation - 90% of the city is destroyed. ""For us, the fundamental things we are not ready to compromise on are our independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. We want to stop the war, our people want the war to end, but it is important for us that Ukraine wins this war. Our people continue to fight for victory. Our victory is the return of control over all our territories,” Andriy Yermak stressed. He also noted that President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his entire team have remained in Kyiv since the beginning of the war. ""Our servicemen continue to fight, they have no break. Therefore, it is our duty - all people in power, politicians - to stay at work and continue to do everything possible to bring victory closer,"" said the Head of the Office of the President. Regarding the US decision to provide $ 33 billion of aid to Ukraine and its influence on the course of the war, Andriy Yermak noted: “First, we hear clear messages that the United States believes and is confident in Ukraine's victory in this war. Secondly, it really changes the level of our cooperation. This was the goal and dream of President Zelenskyy and his entire team - such a level of human relations with the United States. And today we can say: yes, it happened. And we are very grateful."" He noted that opinion polls in the United States show that most Americans are interested and worried about the events in Ukraine. ""This support is important to us,"" added the Head of the President's Office. ""After February 24, the whole world, the whole democratic world understood that this could happen anywhere. Ukraine is defending not only itself, but also the principles of democracy,"" Andriy Yermak stressed."
"The global security system has failed, Ukraine is showing how to build a better one - Andriy Yermak",2022-05-02T11:00:00Z,"The current international security system has expired, so Ukraine is suggesting a new collective agreement on security guarantees as a foundation of the format of a collective response to the global security challenges. Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak wrote this in his op-ed for TIME. He reminded that the system of international relations has been based on the Peace of Westphalia 1648 and its core principles: national sovereignty, foreign and domestic policies separation, compromise as a means of reconciling conflicting national interests, equality of sovereign states, as well as pragmatizing the relationship between them by putting religion out of question. “Russia's war against Ukraine is a rejection of all Westphalian principles. We are denied the right to sovereignty. We are under pressure to change our domestic policy. Under the guise of compromise, we are offered surrender. We are denied subjectivity and therefore equality. Our civilians are being tortured and killed en masse for simply being Ukrainian citizens,” Andriy Yermak noted. According to him, the Russian invasion of Ukraine is a natural consequence of the continuous series of conflicts in which Russia took part after the collapse of the USSR. “Moscow has consciously chosen the path of international relations archaization. It has chosen to consistently deny the primacy of international over national law, systematic violations of agreements, and withdrawal from any rules contradicting its aggressive ambitions. It has chosen to disrupt the international bodies. These are all signs of the drive to replace the rule of law with the right of force,” the Head of the Office of the President emphasized. According to Andriy Yermak, the true goals of Russia move even further into the past to the pre-bloc era of the Vienna Congress.  “However, it is obvious that the current Russian regime is not a restorer. It does not need to recreate either the Romanov Empire or the USSR. It is an attempt to replay history turning moments and cancel or offset unsatisfactory results, including the Caribbean crisis, the dismantling of the Soviet bloc, and subsequent NATO enlargement,” Andriy Yermak emphasized. The Head of the President’s Office believes that the refusal to let Ukraine and Georgia into NATO was a de facto consent to Russia’s aggression against both countries. The era of hybridity in modern international relations started.  As a result, according to him, international organizations have shown a complete inability to stop the aggressor. The EU consensus decisions aimed at deterring and punishing Russia are systematically weakened by national governments. The UN Security Council is in need of reform — a country resorting to annexation, aggressive wars, and genocide should definitely not be its permanent member. NATO still allows Russia to intervene in the enlargement issue, both directly and through cautious politicians.  The Head of the Office of the President stressed that given the situation in the world, the Russian leadership was confident in its right to destroy Ukraine. But the Ukrainian people’s fierce resistance spoiled the game.  “Our longing for freedom has proven to be stronger than pragmatic calculations. It caused astonishment and respect. Only after the tragedies of Mariupol, Bucha, Hostomel, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and dozens of other settlements did the international community start to understand what we are dealing with. Each passing day brings horrible footage of the inhumane crimes of the Russian army. But these tragedies could have been avoided if there were leaders who could defend the world order,” Andriy Yermak noted. According to him, the time has come for the leaders who act decisively, making the dreams possible and realizing possibilities. Such people have been in business for a long time. Until recently, such people were very scarce in politics. One of such leaders is President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who during the greatest trials for our country became the leader of the Ukrainian philosophy of freedom in the whole world. “So, today Ukraine is not just a country near Russia. Not a weak and corrupt state, whose leaders used to buy handshakes and minute meetings on the sidelines. Volodymyr Zelenskyy is different. He is sincere. He is brave. He is popular. It’s a politician of a new formation. And Ukraine is a state of a new formation. Ukrainians are a model of courage for the whole democratic world,” Andriy Yermak emphasized. According to him, there have been too many martyr heroes in our history. So now is the time for the winning heroes. Heroes who will live long and happily in their free state.  The time of Ukraine’s loneliness in the international arena is over. Ukraine is very grateful to all of you who came to our aid, as stated by the Head of the President’s Office. “Lend-lease will help Ukraine survive. Restore the state’s integrity. Bring back our people. Punish the aggressor decisively and severely. This will be our victory. But there is an issue that needs to be addressed now. We need to understand how the world will live afterwards,” Andriy Yermak said. According to him, it is necessary to make sure that no one even thinks about starting wars of aggression again. Ukraine needs reliable, comprehensive, and binding security guarantees. Without them, any agreement with Russia will only be a truce, temporary, and fragile. The Head of the President’s Office noted that Russia is losing strength. The atrocities the Russian soldiers commit are a sign of weakness, a sign of degradation and Russia’s inevitable collapse. So now is the right time for such reforms. Time to reform international institutions. To create an effective security format in the event that NATO does not dare to show determination. “We propose a new collective agreement on security guarantees for Ukraine—as a basis for a collective response to global security challenges,” Andriy Yermak wrote. He added that it is obvious that neutrality cannot be the key issue in this agreement despite systematic efforts to promote this thesis. “This agreement should ensure the status of Ukraine as a democratic, sovereign and integral state—without putting the issues of Donbas and Crimea out of question. The conditions for securing such a status are a matter for discussion, but it is clear that there is room for both the West and the East among the guarantors. For the Americas, Europe, Asia and Africa. For the UN Security Council members, Poland, Italy, Germany, Turkey, Canada, Israel… The club is open. Ukraine is one of the leading guarantors of world food security, so securing it is not only a moral issue, but also a purely practical one. Moreover, Ukraine is the shield protecting Europe from invasion,” the Head of the President’s Office emphasized. In the future, the Ukrainian security platform should become the basis for the U-24, United for Peace multilateral format. A kind of rescue service responsible states would provide for the countries in need.  According to Andriy Yermak, this service will be able within 24 hours to provide aid - humanitarian, financial, material and military-technical - to a state that suffered aggression. And will punish the aggressor within 24 hours by imposing effective sanctions. “Ukraine has been paying a very high price for its leading position in this system. The Moscow-centric world’s inevitable collapse is a chance for new leadership. Democratic. Humane. Human-centered. The leadership of a state whose people value liberty above all,” Andriy Yermak summed up."
"Today we finally managed to start the evacuation of people from Azovstal, we will continue to do everything to evacuate our people from Mariupol - address by the President of Ukraine",2022-05-01T21:22:00Z,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! Today we finally managed to start the evacuation of people from Azovstal. After many weeks of negotiations, after many attempts, different meetings, people, calls, countries, proposals. Finally! There was not a single day when we did not try to find a solution that would save our people. Today, for the first time in all the days of the war, this vital corridor has started working. For the first time there were two days of real ceasefire on this territory. More than a hundred civilians have already been evacuated - women and children first of all. Who were fleeing hostilities there. At Azovstal.  Given all the complexities of the process, the first evacuees will arrive in Zaporizhzhia tomorrow morning. Hopefully this doesn't fail. Our team will meet them there. I hope that tomorrow all the necessary conditions will be met to continue the evacuation of people from Mariupol. We plan to start at 8 am. I am also grateful to all those who participated in the preparation of the rescue of people and who ensure this humanitarian corridor. I am grateful to everyone who held negotiations. To Iryna Vereshchuk as the coordinator of this process. I am grateful to our intelligence. Our team - David, Andriy. And also to the partners who joined and managed to help. In particular, from the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross. We will continue to do everything to evacuate our people from Azovstal, from Mariupol in general. The organization of such humanitarian corridors is one of the elements of the ongoing negotiation process. It is very complex. But no matter how difficult it was, more than 350,000 people were rescued from the areas of hostilities. I discussed key issues of assistance to our state with Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi who visited Kyiv together with a US Congress delegation. We are grateful to all partners who convey such important and powerful signals of support for Ukraine to the world and to Russia by visiting our capital in these conditions and at such a difficult time. Mrs. Pelosi and I had four hours of very substantive negotiations, as they say, multifaceted. In particular, on defense supplies, macro-financial assistance, sanctions policy, political cooperation with the United States. I thanked for the revival of the historic Lend-Lease program, which once helped protect freedom in Europe and can certainly do so a second time. We discussed specific areas - how Lend-Lease can work to strengthen our state as much as possible and help in the struggle for freedom. I also thanked for the preparation of a large package of aid to Ukraine worth 33 billion US dollars. We discussed how we can strengthen sanctions on Russia in a way that most effectively encourages it to end the war and limits Russia's ability to circumvent existing and future sanctions. I felt the support of our initiatives. I awarded Mrs. Pelosi with the Order of Princess Olga for her significant personal contribution to strengthening our cooperation and sincere participation in the defense of freedom. Today, Russian troops continued to strike at the territory of our state. The targets they choose prove once again that the war against Ukraine is a war of extermination for the Russian army. They targeted the warehouses of agricultural enterprises. The grain warehouse was destroyed. The warehouse with fertilizers was also shelled. They continued shelling of residential neighborhoods in the Kharkiv region, Donbas, etc. They are accumulating forces in the south of the country to try to attack our cities and communities in the Dnipropetrovsk region. What could be Russia's strategic success in this war? Honestly, I do not know. The ruined lives of people and the burned or stolen property will give nothing to Russia. It will only increase the toxicity of the Russian state and the number of those in the world who will work to isolate Russia. The Armed Forces of Ukraine respond to all the attacks of the invaders. And they will continue to respond until the occupiers leave our land. I am grateful to all our defenders. To everyone who has been defending the state since February 24 and since 2014. In just 67 days of the full-scale war, 143 our warriors have already been awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. More than 10,600 defenders have been awarded state awards of Ukraine. Eternal glory to all who stood up for the state! Eternal memory to all who gave life for Ukraine! Thank you. Glory to Ukraine!"
President of Ukraine met with the Speaker of the US House of Representatives,2022-05-01T09:11:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress Nancy Pelosi, who is on a visit to Ukraine. The President thanked the Speaker for her visit. ""I am grateful to you for this signal of strong support from the United States, the people and the Congress — bicameral and bipartisan support. I, as the President, our team and the people of Ukraine highly appreciate this signal. This shows that the United States today is a leader in strong support for Ukraine during the war against the aggression of the Russian Federation,"" he said. The President thanked the United States and Nancy Pelosi personally for the efforts to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country. ""The signals that the United States and President Biden are giving today are very important. These are recent strong steps in defense and financial support for Ukraine, as well as decisions on Lend-Lease - we are grateful for that,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He stressed the importance of the address by President of the United States of America Joseph Biden to the Congress to provide Ukraine with financial assistance in the amount of USD 33 billion. For her part, the Speaker of the House of Representatives conveyed greetings from the Congress and the people of the United States to the President of Ukraine. Nancy Pelosi noted that today Ukraine is heroically fighting for freedom, and the United States is ready to help our country until this struggle is over. According to her, Ukraine is the frontier of freedom. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded the Order of Princess Olga to Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi for her significant personal contribution to strengthening Ukrainian-American interstate cooperation and supporting sovereign, independent and democratic Ukraine."
"We still need to fight and direct all efforts to drive the occupiers out, and we will do it - address by the President of Ukraine",2022-04-30T23:35:00Z,"Unbreakable people of the bravest country! Today we marked the Border Guard Day. It is clear that there can be no celebrations during the war. But it is necessary to support Ukrainian men and women who defend the state in the ranks of the Border Guard Service. Since the first days of the war - and not only since February 24, but also since 2014 - border guards have been bravely defending Ukraine. They fulfill combat missions. They were the first to face the Russian invaders at the state border. They are under daily shelling. They are fighting side by side with the Armed Forces of Ukraine, with our National Guard, with the National Police, with the territorial defense and all those who stood up for our state. In particular, they are fighting in Mariupol, heroically defending our city. 340 border guards - our heroes. I talked to them today. Congratulated them. Thanked them. I am grateful to everyone whose professional day was today. I had the honor to present state awards to border guards who distinguished themselves in the battles for our state. The occupiers are accumulating additional forces for new attacks against our military in the east of the country. They built up reinforcements in the Kharkiv region, trying to increase pressure in Donbas. They have already lost more than 23,000 soldiers in the battles of this senseless war for Russia. But they do not stop. We know that the Russian command is preparing for new big losses. In those units, the personnel of which was almost completely destroyed or significantly weakened in March-April, new people are being recruited. With little motivation. With little combat experience. They just want to get the right amount. So that they can throw these units into the offensive. The Russian command is well aware that thousands more Russian soldiers will be killed and thousands more will be wounded in the coming weeks. But why do the Russian soldiers themselves need this? Why do their families need this? Russian commanders lie to their soldiers saying they will face some serious responsibility for refusing to fight. And at the same time they do not tell, for example, about the preparation by the Russian army of additional refrigerators for storing corpses. They do not tell what new ""planned"" losses the generals expect. Every Russian soldier can still save his life. You'd better survive in Russia than die on our land. Our defenders have already destroyed more than a thousand Russian tanks. Almost two hundred Russian aircraft. Almost two and a half thousand armored fighting vehicles. Of course, the occupiers still have equipment in stock. Yes, they still have missiles to strike at our territory. But this war has already weakened Russia so much that they have to plan even fewer military equipment for the parade in Moscow. We are actively communicating with partners to enhance sanctions on Russia. For Mariupol, for all the destroyed cities and communities of Ukraine, for war crimes against our people. For missile and air strikes at the territory of Ukraine. Today the occupiers again fired missiles at the Dnipropetrovsk region and Odesa. Again and again, Russian troops prove that the people of Odesa are the same enemies for Russia as all other Ukrainians. The runway of the Odesa airport was destroyed. We will, of course, rebuild it. But Odesa will never forget such a Russian attitude towards it. We expect a decision on oil restrictions against Russia in the near future. We insist that a fair part of sanctions against Russian oil should be the blocking of any attempts by Russia to circumvent restrictions through the sale of so-called oil blends. If any company or state helps Russia trade oil, it must also face sanctions. Any sponsorship in the interests of the Russian military terrorist machine must end. I spoke today with President of France Emmanuel Macron. On various areas of cooperation between Ukraine and France, especially on defense. Also - on cooperation on Ukraine's path to the European Union. We are moving towards the political formalization of what is already a fact: Ukraine has become an integral part of a united Europe. I also spoke with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. On defense support for Ukraine and other efforts necessary to end the war. I informed Boris about the current situation on the battlefield in the areas of active clashes and in detail about the situation in our east, in Mariupol, in the south of the country. All the leaders of the free world know what Russia has done to Mariupol. And Russia will not go unpunished for this. Many of the leaders are trying to help save our heroic defenders of the city. This was discussed in great detail with the UN Secretary-General during his visit to Kyiv. We are doing everything to ensure that the evacuation mission from Mariupol is carried out. I held talks with President of Switzerland Cassis. Thanked for the humanitarian support of Ukraine and Ukrainians. The mediating role of Switzerland in helping Ukrainians who found themselves in Russia was discussed. Preparations for the conference on postwar reconstruction of our state were also discussed. We are doing everything to return normal life to the de-occupied part of our Ukraine. The work of humanitarian offices has already begun in 93% of de-occupied settlements. We are actively demining the liberated territory. Every day several dozen settlements are added to the list of those where demining has been completed. 69% of de-occupied settlements are again with full-fledged local self-government. We are restoring electricity supply, communications, water supply and gas supply. We are doing everything to return normal medicine, educational services, access to financial institutions. We are restoring roads. Of course, there is still a lot of work ahead. The occupiers are still on our land and still do not recognize the apparent failure of their so-called operation. We still need to fight and direct all efforts to drive the occupiers out. And we will do it. Ukraine will be free. Kherson, Nova Kakhovka, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Dniprorudne and all other temporarily occupied cities and communities in which the occupiers are now pretending to be ""masters"" will be liberated. The Ukrainian flag will return wherever it should be by right. Return with a normal life, which Russia is simply unable to provide even on its own territory. I signed a decree on awarding our defenders - warriors of the National Guard of Ukraine. 133 national guards were awarded state awards, 11 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Eternal glory to everyone who stood up for the state! Glory to Ukraine!"
Andriy Yermak discussed with the Chief Advisor to the President of Turkey the development of a system of effective security guarantees for Ukraine,2022-04-30T18:41:00Z,"Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak met with Presidential Spokesperson and Chief Advisor to the President of Turkey, Ambassador İbrahim Kalın. Andriy Yermak informed his Turkish counterpart about the situation on the frontline and the heroic resistance of the Ukrainian people to the aggressor. Separately, the Head of the Office of the President informed of the extremely difficult situation in the city of Mariupol in the Donetsk region. The interlocutors discussed a wide range of issues of bilateral cooperation. Particular attention was paid to building a system of effective international security guarantees for our country. Ukraine is interested in Turkey being one of its parties."
Volodymyr Zelenskyy: The State Border Guard Service is one of the fundamental pillars of the defense of the Ukrainian state,2022-04-30T17:15:00Z,"On the Day of the Border Guard, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with the defenders of the state border of Ukraine and presented awards to them. ""In the context of Russia's full-scale brutal war against our independent state, against our strong people, we cannot afford to celebrate. Russian evil is still on our land, we must drive out the occupiers. And then we will celebrate. And it will definitely be after our victory. And now it is our duty to honor your contribution, the contribution of the Border Guard Service of Ukraine, each and every one to the common struggle of the Ukrainian people,"" the President said, congratulating the border guards on their professional holiday. The President stressed that the border guards were the first to face the invader and are now performing one of the most important tasks - controlling the border line, responding to enemy activity near the borders, protecting our land from insidious and cynical attacks by Russia. ""The protection of Ukraine from saboteurs and the enemy's attempts to destroy our supply chains depends on the professionalism and efficiency of the State Border Guard Service. Border guards also provide normal economic ties with our partners in the western and southwestern parts of the border. Your service is one of the fundamental pillars of our protection. And I am grateful to everyone who defends the state border,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The Head of State thanked all the border defenders who, together with other soldiers, are fighting for freedom of Ukrainians, in particular those border guards who are heroically defending Mariupol. The President stressed that the names of border guards who died in battles with the Russian aggressor are forever inscribed with gold letters in the pantheon of Heroes of Ukraine. He expressed confidence that our state will protect its freedom in this war, and our people will defeat the Russian invaders who came to Ukrainian land to destroy us. ""Everyone who defends the Ukrainian state, fights for the opportunity to live freely in their own home, for freedom and security for their children, for peace for their parents - I am grateful to all of you, I wish all our soldiers to see victory soon. I wish happiness, well-being to your families, the families of all our defenders,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The attendees honored the memory of the fallen border guards with a moment of silence. The President presented the border guards with state awards, as well as honorary and new military ranks. 12 servicemen were awarded the Orders of Bohdan Khmelnytsky of various degrees, the Order of Danylo Halytsky, medals ""For Military Service of Ukraine"", ""For Impeccable Service"" of the III degree and ""Defender of the Homeland"". One officer was awarded the honorary title of ""Honored Lawyer of Ukraine"". Five border guards were given new military ranks."
Lend-Lease and other programs in support of Ukraine prove that freedom is still able to defend itself against tyranny - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-04-29T22:03:00Z,"Unbreakable people of the bravest country! The 65th day of our defense is coming to an end. We are beating the occupiers in all directions where they are trying to advance. The situation in the Kharkiv region is tough. But our military, our intelligence, have important tactical success. In Donbas, the occupiers are doing everything to destroy any life in this area. Constant brutal bombings, constant Russian strikes at infrastructure and residential areas show that Russia wants to make this area uninhabited. Therefore, the defense of our land, the protection of our people is literally a struggle for life. For Lysychansk, Severodonetsk, Popasna, Kramatorsk, Slovyansk, Marinka and all other cities and communities of Donbas, which Russian troops want to turn into ruins, absolutely everything is being decided in this war. Only if Ukraine withstands will they live. If the Russian invaders succeed in realizing their plans, at least in part, they will still have enough artillery and aircraft to destroy the entire Donbas. Just as they destroyed Mariupol. The city, which was one of the most developed in the region, is simply a Russian concentration camp in the middle of ruins. And the order of the occupiers in that part of Mariupol which they unfortunately still control differs insignificantly from what the Nazis did in the occupied territory of Eastern Europe. But the Russian troops manage to be even more cynical than the Nazis 80 years ago. At that time, the invaders did not say that it was the Mariupol residents and the defenders of the city who shelled and killed themselves. I am grateful to the United States, President Biden and Congress for an analogue of the famous Lend-Lease program, which will be very helpful in the fight against Russia, against the Russian invaders. Which helped a lot in the fight against the Nazis during World War II. I am sure that now the Lend-Lease will help Ukraine and the whole free world beat the ideological successors of the Nazis, who started a war against us on our land. Lend-Lease and other programs in support of Ukraine are concrete proof that freedom is still able to defend itself against tyranny. Today, the Government of Ukraine considered the issue of eliminating the deficit in the fuel market. Queues and rising prices at gas stations are seen in many regions of our country. The occupiers are deliberately destroying the infrastructure for the production, supply and storage of fuel. Russia has also blocked our ports, so there are no immediate solutions to replenish the deficit. But government officials promise that within a week, maximum two, a system of fuel supply to Ukraine will be provided that will be able to prevent a deficit. This is a difficult task after the Russian missile strike at the Kremenchuk refinery. But government officials along with fuel suppliers, traders and networks must fulfill this task no matter how difficult it may be. I'm sure they will. We must take from the European Union as much fuel as our citizens need now. Ambassador of the United Kingdom to Ukraine Melinda Simmons returned to Kyiv today. Currently, 27 foreign diplomatic missions operate in the capital of our country. And this is an extremely important gesture of support for Ukraine, for which we are grateful to all of them. Such gestures, together with strong defensive, financial and political support from the free world, mean that the need to end the war is becoming more and more obvious to Russia. The defeat of the occupiers is unalterable. In the temporarily occupied areas of the Kherson region, collaborators say that they are allegedly preparing for the transition to the ""ruble zone"". Any attempt to transfer our territory to Russia's administrative, monetary, or any other system will mean only one thing: Russia itself will suffer from that. Our responses, sanctions and other reactions of the free world to Russia's aggressive actions will not be delayed. The dismantlement of debris in Kyiv, where Russian missiles hit yesterday during the visit of UN Secretary-General António Guterres, continues. Unfortunately, such a deliberate and brutal humiliation of the United Nations by Russia was left without a powerful response. Today it became known that a journalist, an employee of Radio Liberty Vera Hyrych was killed by a Russian missile hitting a residential building in Kyiv. She became the 23rd media representative whose life was cut short as a result of the Russian invasion since February 24. My condolences to all relatives and friends. Eternal memory to all the victims of this war! Today in the White Hall of Heroes of Ukraine in the Mariyinsky Palace, I presented awards to our defenders and members of the families of fallen warriors. The Order of the Golden Star was awarded to the Heroes of Ukraine: Lieutenant Colonel Serhiy Burkovsky, Captain Vitaliy Hural, Senior Lieutenant Dmytro Dozirchy, Lieutenant Colonel Oleksandr Zuhravy, Colonel Dmytro Kashchenko, Major Oleksandr Kukurba, Captain Oleh Pasichnyk, Lieutenant Colonel Vyacheslav Tsyhankov, Colonel of the Medical Service Oleksandr Sliesarenko, Lieutenant Colonel Leonid Khoda, Colonel Denys Chayuk and Lieutenant General Serhiy Nayev. Also, three servicemen were posthumously awarded the Order of the Golden Star. I had the honor to hand them over to the relatives of our heroes - Sergeant Volodymyr Balyuk, Master Sergeant Oleksandr Tsyupak, Major Pavlo Sbytov. It is thanks to our heroes, thanks to all those who stood up for our state, that we can live, can be with our families in our homes. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"
Ukraine is grateful to Poland and its people for the strong support during the difficult times of the war - President,2022-04-29T21:55:00Z,"Ukraine and Ukrainians are grateful to Poland and its people for the strong support they have provided to our country and our citizens since the first minutes of Russian aggression and continue to provide now. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an interview with Polish media. ""I want to thank the people of Poland, because this is unprecedented support for Ukraine. Unprecedented support for the Ukrainian people from the Polish people,"" the President said. According to him, Poland has sheltered 2.5 million Ukrainians who were forced to flee their homeland, to escape the war, and is now doing everything possible to ensure that they do not feel like refugees. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also stressed that he is personally grateful to Andrzej Duda and his wife Agata, who ""showed a special attitude to Ukraine."" The President also noted the fact that against the backdrop of the war, Ukraine and Poland managed to unite and push back to the background the historical issues they had before. ""Poland has a special relationship with Ukraine, and it seems to me that even the historical issues that the two countries have are insignificant compared to how united our countries have become since the beginning of this brazen war waged by Russia. Friendship, unity - we felt all this from Poland,"" he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that since the beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, he has been in constant contact with his Polish counterpart - every day or several times a day. This helped quickly approve joint decisions that facilitated the resolution of the situation at the borders and helped Ukrainian citizens fleeing the war. There was an understanding of the need to make quick decisions ""without excessive bureaucracy"" on crossing the border, which would help in a difficult situation, said the Ukrainian President. ""We decided to open (the border - ed.) by phone. Poland met Ukrainians not just as its neighbors but as a family, without checking, because there was no time to check the documents of each child,"" said the President. ""Therefore, I am grateful for this - that Poland forgot about the bureaucracy, just as Ukraine did, and we had such a special relationship in the first days,"" he added. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it has finally become clear who is a friend and who is an enemy. ""And the understanding of who is historically our partner in the future has also emerged. We do not have two opinions. One opinion, one friend, one enemy - to unite and win the war. This is a completely understandable thing. When you do not waste time on unnecessary dialogues. You know for sure: there is an enemy, and here is a friend. And it's simple, because it's straightforward,"" the President summed up."
Poland is interested in entering the Ukrainian gas station market - Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-04-29T21:14:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that he had discussed with Polish President Andrzej Duda the entry of Polish companies into the Ukrainian fuel market. He said this in an interview with Polish media. ""We are having a conversation with Poland - the Polish company came to us, met with our ""Naftogaz"" and the Minister of Energy. They really want to enter our market of gas station business. We have a large open network. I think they will enter,"" the Head of State said. According to him, this issue was discussed with the President of Poland. It was also discussed by the Prime Ministers of the two countries. In addition, Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that Ukraine has recently joined the European energy network ENTSO-E under an accelerated procedure. This happened despite the war thanks to the successful work of Ukrainian specialists. The President noted that this year our state has passed the examination - disconnected from the Russian and Belarusian energy systems for some time and was to join the EU energy system next year, but it happened in 2022. ""We had to show the European Union that we were ready. And we were ready. This probationary period - so it happened - has become permanent, we have joined these networks. Yes, it will help Ukraine a lot,"" the President said. He thanked President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and President of the European Council Charles Michel for their support on this path. Volodymyr Zelenskyy is convinced that Ukraine, for its part, will also help European countries in supplying energy. ""Our nuclear generation is very large. We will be able to sell electricity at normal prices, and not do artificially for other countries to earn something,"" he said, adding that Ukraine's accession to the European market will lead to lower electricity prices, which will benefit consumers. At the same time, according to the President, there are a number of technical issues that are difficult to resolve quickly in the face of armed aggression by Russia. The President also said that he addressed IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi during his visit to Kyiv regarding assistance in unblocking the Zaporizhzhia NPP from the Russian occupiers."
President presented awards to the military and family members of the fallen defenders who were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine,2022-04-29T18:50:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy presented the Golden Star orders to servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine and to family members of the warriors who were posthumously awarded this title. The solemn ceremony took place in the White Hall of Heroes of Ukraine at the Mariyinsky Palace in Kyiv. The Head of State stressed that it is a great honor for him to award the heroes who are in our history and always remain in our memory. After all, they are fighting for our lives and freedom, for an opportunity for millions of Ukrainians to be with their families in their homes. ""We will always be grateful to all those who stood up for our country in this war waged by Russia. And we will always remember each and every one who gave life for Ukraine and for each of us,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The President reminded that today is the 65th day of Ukraine's full-scale war for its land against Russia. ""Russia hoped that we would not withstand even five days. But thanks to the heroes who are here today among us, thanks to our unity and desire to live freely, we are fighting,"" he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine will beat the occupiers until it liberates its land and its people. The Head of State thanked all those who are now on the frontline, who are doing everything in their power to help Ukraine win. ""And Ukraine will definitely win,"" he said. The President noted that on behalf of the entire Ukrainian people he bows his head to the relatives of the heroes who died for Ukraine. ""In this hall of the Mariyinsky Palace, where we met the highest guests of the state, we express our highest respect to our heroes. In this White Hall of Heroes of Ukraine, we award those thanks to whom Ukraine lives,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy."
Ihor Zhovkva discussed topical issues of bilateral cooperation with the Federal Minister for the EU and the Austrian Constitution,2022-04-28T23:05:00Z,"Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Ihor Zhovkva held a video conference with Federal Minister for the EU and Constitution at the Federal Chancellery of Austria Karoline Edtstadler. Ihor Zhovkva thanked Austria for the warm welcome of about 50,000 Ukrainians who were forced to flee their homes, and praised the initiative of the Federal Chancellery to double the funds raised through the charity event ""Neighbor in Need."" During the conversation, the parties discussed the need for the European Union to strengthen sanctions on Russia. ""We count on Austria's support for the soonest possible approval of the sixth sanctions package, which should definitely include an oil embargo and disconnection of all Russian banks from the SWIFT system. It is necessary to put an end to the financing of Russia's aggression through the purchase of Russian energy resources,"" Ihor Zhovkva stressed. Austria's clear position on maintaining European unity on the refusal to pay for gas supplies with Russian rubles was noted. The interlocutors paid special attention to Ukraine's priorities in the field of European integration. The Deputy Head of the Office of the President briefed Karoline Edtstadler on the latest achievements in this area. Ihor Zhovkva expressed disappointment with the recent statements by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Austria Alexander Schallenberg, which do not contribute to the achievement of our country's main goals of European integration. Ihor Zhovkva is convinced that the expected positive recommendation by the European Commission based on the results of the review of Ukraine's answers to the questionnaire will allow EU member states to support Ukraine's acquisition of EU candidate status in June this year. The Deputy Head of the Office of the President called on the Austrian side to support the European Commission's proposal to abolish customs tariffs and quotas on Ukrainian industrial and agricultural products. Also expectations were expressed that an agreement between Ukraine and the EU on the liberalization of road transport would be signed as soon as possible."
Together with allies we can definitely stop the Russian aggression and reliably defend freedom in Europe - address by the President of Ukraine,2022-04-28T22:57:00Z,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today we have significant news for our state, for our defense. First, the United States has prepared a new support package for Ukraine worth $ 33 billion. In particular, more than 20 billion can be allocated for defense. More than $ 8 billion is planned for economic support. Another $ 3 billion will be allocated for humanitarian aid. This is a very important step by the United States. And I am grateful to the American people and personally to President Biden for it. I hope that the Congress will quickly support this request for help to our state. President Biden rightly said today that this step is not cheap. But the negative consequences of Russia's aggression against Ukraine and against democracy are so large-scale for the whole world that, in comparison with them, this support from the United States is necessary. Together, we can certainly stop Russian aggression and reliably defend freedom in Europe. We are also working to direct the blocked assets of Russian individuals subject to sanctions and the Russian state to compensate Ukraine for this war and to restore normal life. The investigation into the crimes committed by the Russian military against our people is underway. Ukraine's position is absolutely clear - every Russian criminal must be and will be brought to justice. Whoever they are and wherever they hide, we will find them all and make them bear responsibility. The first ten Russian servicemen from the 64th motorized rifle brigade of the Russian Ground Forces who committed crimes against our people in Bucha, Kyiv region, received the status of suspects. Their surnames are known. It is established what they did. We know all the details about them and their actions. And we will find everyone. Just as we will find all the other Russian thugs who killed and tortured Ukrainians. Who tormented our people. Who destroyed houses and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine. None of these bastards will avoid responsibility. However, some of them may not survive until trial and fair punishment. But for one reason only. This Russian brigade was relocated to the Kharkiv region. There they will get retribution from our military. Prime Minister of Bulgaria Kiril Petkov paid a visit to Kyiv today. We had very substantive and very warm negotiations with him. Bulgaria is one of those countries that reacted to Russia's aggression in a principled manner and quickly. I am grateful to both the Bulgarian government and the Bulgarian people for not delaying the support for our state. Defense, energy and transport issues were discussed with Mr. Petkov. Sanctions pressure on Russia, which is necessary for peace. We also discussed our cooperation at the EU level. A very important agreement is on the repair of our military equipment at the Bulgarian production facilities. Another issue we agreed on is the supply of Ukrainian electricity to Bulgaria and the use of the Trans-Balkan gas pipeline together with the Bulgarian side. I am grateful to Bulgaria for the opportunity to use the port of Varna to export our agricultural capacity. UN Secretary-General António Guterres was also in Ukraine today. It is very important that Mr. Secretary-General visited Borodyanka, Kyiv region. And saw with his own eyes what the Russian occupiers had done there. Hundreds of Ukrainian cities and hundreds of communities have experienced the same thing as Borodyanka and Bucha. The Russian army in Ukraine consciously and without any doubt trampled down everything on which the global order was based after World War II. The UN Charter, international conventions, declarations, the rights of people and states... Everything that should guarantee freedom and security in the world is simply destroyed by Russia's aggressive actions. So the key issue in the talks with the UN Secretary-General was how to stop Russian aggression. And this is not just a question of Ukraine, our fate. This is a question of the fate of the United Nations, the fate of international law, the fate of many nations - and not just Russia's neighbors who may become the next victims of Moscow's aggressive ambitions. Of course, during the negotiations we paid a lot of attention to saving our people from Mariupol. I believe that with the help of the UN it is possible to organize an evacuation mission. Ukraine is ready for these steps. But it is also necessary for the Russian side to consider this issue without cynicism and actually do what it says. Moscow claimed they had allegedly ceased fire in Mariupol. But the bombing of the defenders of the city continues. This is a war crime committed by the Russian military literally in front of the whole world. Russia's shelling of Mariupol did not stop even when the UN Secretary-General was holding negotiations in Moscow. And today, immediately after the end of our talks in Kyiv, Russian missiles flew into the city. Five missiles. And this says a lot about Russia's true attitude to global institutions. About the efforts of the Russian leadership to humiliate the UN and everything that the Organization represents. Therefore, it requires a strong response. Russian missile strikes at Ukraine - Kyiv, Fastiv, Odesa, and other cities - once again prove that we cannot let our guard down. We cannot think that the war is over. We still have to fight. We still have to drive the occupiers out. Today, the Russian army continued its offensive attempts in the east of our country, in Donbas. Tries to advance in the southern regions. The Armed Forces of Ukraine repel the invaders. And I am grateful to each of our defenders who are holding positions. We are doing everything to help our army, to provide the military with all the necessary weapons. Every time I contact my partners, I emphasize that weapons for Ukraine right now, the very types we ask for and just when we need them, are salvation not only for our people. This is salvation for all of you - for all of Europe. I am grateful to those partners who understand this. And who help convince others. Before delivering the evening address, I signed a decree awarding our heroes. 214 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 14 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who gave life for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all who stood up for the state! Glory to Ukraine!"
Possible pseudo-referendum in the occupied territories will complicate possible negotiations between Ukraine and Russia - President,2022-04-28T22:49:00Z,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasizes that in the event of any pseudo-referendums in the occupied territories they will not be recognized by Ukraine and the world and will complicate possible negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. The President made this statement during a meeting with media representatives following talks with UN Secretary-General António Guterres in Kyiv. ""I believe that it is impossible and will not be possible to annex one or another part of our territories by force,"" the President stressed. He reminded that in the occupied cities Ukrainians protested against the armed Russian occupiers. ""This (pseudo-referendum - ed.) will not bring anything, except that this is another complication of probable, at least some kind of probable negotiations between Ukraine and Russia... It seems to me that this is a complication of any negotiations,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. According to him, today there are questions of humanitarian aspects to Russia - to unblock people, as well as economic questions related to food security and unblocking sea routes. ""Many questions. If they want to complicate all this for the whole of Europe and the world, they can continue to play with these referendums, which will not yield any results - either current or historical,"" the President concluded."
Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with the UN Secretary-General in Kyiv,2022-04-28T22:10:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Secretary-General of the United Nations António Guterres who arrived in Kyiv. The President noted the importance of the UN Secretary-General's visit to Ukraine, as today it is our country that defends the principles of the United Nations Charter. Before the meeting with the President of Ukraine, António Guterres visited the suburbs of Kyiv and saw with his own eyes the horrible war crimes of Russia in our country. ""I am grateful to Mr. Guterres for the clear and unequivocal position on the war against Ukraine. We appreciate your efforts to use the ""good offices"" mechanisms to de-escalate the situation. Every opportunity must be used to achieve peace,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said during a meeting with media representatives following talks with the UN Secretary-General. According to him, during the conversation the parties touched upon the issue of establishing a special international tribunal on Russia's crimes. ""For its part, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission must continue to document all crimes committed by the Russian Federation and the Russian military,"" the President said. The President of Ukraine and the UN Secretary-General also discussed the support for Ukrainians through cash payments, increasing humanitarian aid to Ukraine, as well as the importance of involving the UN in the post-war reconstruction of our state. Volodymyr Zelenskyy and António Guterres also paid attention to the food crisis provoked by the war. ""Ukraine is literally giving bread to almost 400 million people on the planet. And now the UN recognizes that rising food prices this year will cause famine for at least 47 million people in 81 countries,"" said the President. The interlocutors discussed how to do everything possible for Russia to unblock Ukrainian ports for food exports. For his part, António Guterres stressed that the UN considers the Russian invasion of Ukraine a violation of the territorial integrity of our state and the Charter of the United Nations. The UN Secretary-General noted that he is determined to enhance the support for Ukrainian citizens, help save lives and minimize suffering, and find a way to peace. António Guterres informed about the work of the UN together with the Ukrainian government and organizations to provide assistance to Ukrainians. According to him, the UN has already provided humanitarian aid to 3.4 million people in Ukraine, and intends to support 8.7 million people by the end of August. The United Nations is also ready to provide financial assistance. In addition, the UN supports the countries that have sheltered Ukrainian citizens fleeing the war and internally displaced persons in Ukraine. According to António Guterres, the WHO provides medical supplies for emergency care, treatment of injuries for more than 7 million people. Efforts are being made to support the first aid system and so on. António Guterres also stressed the importance of the work of the International Criminal Court. ""Now we are at ground zero as regards the world we need to build. A world of respect for international law, the UN Charter, and the power of multilateralism. A world where civilians have protection. Where human rights are a priority. Where leaders live up to the declared values they have committed to. It is also a struggle, but we must win it for the sake of every country, community and person around the world,"" said the Secretary-General."
Ukraine is ready for urgent talks to evacuate people from Mariupol and counts on UN support - Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-04-28T21:20:00Z,"During the negotiations in Kyiv, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy and UN Secretary-General António Guterres discussed the evacuation of Ukrainian citizens from the Russian-besieged city of Mariupol in the Donetsk region, including the Azovstal plant. The Ukrainian Head of State noted that António Guterres discussed this issue during his recent visit to Russia. ""We see that despite the words of the Russian President about the alleged cessation of hostilities in Mariupol, the territory of the Azovstal plant is under barbaric bombing by the Russian army. And this continued even during the talks of the Secretary-General in Moscow,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said during a meeting with media representatives following the negotiations with António Guterres. He stressed that Ukraine is ready for urgent talks to evacuate people from Mariupol and hopes that the participation of the UN Secretary-General in this mission will be effective. The Head of State also called on António Guterres to make efforts to stop the deportation of Ukrainian citizens to Russia, gain access to the forcibly deported and return them to their homeland as soon as possible. Answering journalists' questions, the President expressed hope that with the participation of the UN Secretary-General he would be able to bring people back alive from Mariupol. For his part, António Guterres assured that he is doing everything possible to save people in Mariupol. ""I want to tell you, Mr. President, and the people of Ukraine: we do not give up. We will continue to call for a complete ceasefire, as well as for immediate practical measures to save lives and minimize human suffering. Effective humanitarian corridors, local cessation of hostilities, safe routes for civilians and victims. Today, the residents of Mariupol need just such a step,"" he said. The UN Secretary-General stressed that thousands of civilians in the city - the elderly, the sick and persons with reduced mobility - need vital assistance. ""They need a rescue route to leave this hell,"" said António Guterres. The UN Secretary-General said that during his recent visit to Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin had agreed in general to involve the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross in the evacuation of civilians from Azovstal. ""Today, Mr. Zelenskyy and I had the opportunity to discuss this issue. Intensive discussions are currently underway to implement this proposal,"" said António Guterres."
Volodymyr Zelenskyy: We seek to elaborate an agreement that will provide real guarantees for Ukraine's security,2022-04-28T18:30:00Z,"Ukraine seeks to elaborate a document on guarantees of our security, which would provide maximum and real protection for our country, said President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ""We want to get the maximum for our country and our people. Maximum. And there will be such guarantees,"" the Head of State said, answering questions from the media representatives after a meeting with Prime Minister of Bulgaria Kiril Petkov in Kyiv. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, after the Budapest Memorandum proved its ineffectiveness, Ukraine is not interested in any new ""patchwork umbrellas"". ""Sometimes it's better to have nothing and know that you are alone with the enemy than to have a large circle of friends, partners who in fact will not protect you,"" he said. That is why, according to the President, Ukraine seeks to elaborate a thorough document that will really work. ""This time we are very serious and balanced about the future document. And about the circle of partner countries, which should not let us down in case of any aggression in the future,"" the Head of State stated. As Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted, after the end of the current war, Russia will not disappear from the eastern border of Ukraine, so we need a fundamental document that will allow our state to coexist with such a neighbor in the future. The Head of State said that the draft document is currently being prepared at the level of security advisers to the leaders of the countries, which will later join the circle of guarantors of Ukraine's security. ""When everything is ready, I think our society, our journalists will definitely see the details of future agreements,"" the President concluded."

The President stressed that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has been going on for 64 days already. The aggressor attacks both military and civilians, destroys infrastructure. But our state is fighting back, and Russia will achieve nothing but ""contempt and condemnation from all decent people in the world."" Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked Kiril Petkov for the fact that Bulgaria, like the whole civilized world, stands in solidarity with Ukraine today. ""Our state now needs the support of our reliable friends more than ever to defend the right to life, to our own state, to the European future for our people. But this struggle is not only for Ukraine. Now in Ukraine we defend the values of the whole of Europe, the whole world. And right now, in Ukraine, it is being decided whether other nations of Europe will be able to live freely, to live democratically,"" the President is convinced. According to him, during today's meeting with the Prime Minister of Bulgaria, cooperation was initiated to repair Ukrainian military equipment at Bulgarian production facilities. ""It is very important for Ukraine. I am sure that such cooperation will be beneficial for both Bulgarian companies and Bulgarian economy. And for us, quality and time are very important, because we fight every day,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. The issue of cooperation in the energy sphere was also raised. According to the President, Ukraine is ready to supply electricity to Bulgaria and is also interested in diversifying gas supplies in the region, in particular by using the Trans-Balkan gas pipeline together with the Bulgarian side. In addition, according to the President, an agreement was reached to establish the transportation of agricultural products from Ukraine through the Bulgarian port of Varna on the Black Sea coast. For its part, the Ukrainian side will provide the necessary assistance to resolve as soon as possible the issue with the Bulgarian ship blocked in the Chornomorsk sea port. Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked Kiril Petkov for the government's position in support of the European Union's sanctions policy. ""I want to emphasize that sanctions against Russia are needed only to force Russia to seek peace. For this to happen, sanctions must be effective, strong and not allow Russia to circumvent the restrictions. I hope that Bulgaria will continue to support the strengthening of sanctions for this war,"" he said. During the meeting, the interlocutors paid special attention to Ukraine's movement towards EU membership. The President thanked the Prime Minister of Bulgaria for the clear and consistent support for Ukraine's European future. ""In February, at our meeting in Munich, we signed a joint declaration on Ukraine's European perspective. Today, I received assurances that Bulgaria will support the decision to grant Ukraine the status of a candidate country for accession to the European Union at the next meeting of the European Council. I am very glad that our partners recognize that Ukraine has deserved an accelerated procedure for joining the EU,"" the President said. The President also thanked Kiril Petkov for his personal initiative to raise funds in Bulgaria in support of Ukraine. ""By your own example, you inspire thousands of your fellow citizens to continue to show solidarity with our Ukrainian people. More than 90,000 Ukrainians, mostly women and children fleeing the horrors of war, have found shelter in Bulgaria. We are grateful to the Bulgarian people for their hospitality, support and really touching attitude,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The President of Ukraine noted Bulgaria's readiness to take part in the post-war reconstruction of our country, in particular one of the southern regions. He stressed that the high level of cooperation between Ukraine and Bulgaria and sincere mutual understanding prove that we are one European family united by a common past and, most importantly, a common future. Prime Minister of Bulgaria Kiril Petkov, for his part, expressed support for our state. He noted that his country is ready to promote the export of electricity from Ukraine, can offer the port of Varna as a logistics hub, in particular for flour, and help use the Trans-Balkan gas pipeline. According to him, Bulgaria will be happy to help and join the reconstruction of Ukraine. The Prime Minister also responded positively to Ukraine's request to repair and restore military equipment. ""It is important for Bulgaria that Ukraine moves to the European Union. It is time to say that Ukraine belongs to the EU and the European family. We must give a clear signal and show a clear path. You have the support of Bulgaria,"" Kiril Petkov summed up."

The audience observed a minute of silence in tribute to the memory of all citizens who gave their lives for the homeland. The participants of the event discussed the Plan of postwar reconstruction of Ukraine, as well as the creation of comfortable living conditions for all those who were forced to leave their homes due to the war.

According to Tymoshenko, today the state has to give almost 600,000 apartments to provide housing for displaced persons. Given the scale of the needs, the approach of building from scratch was chosen, as well as the purchase of ready-made apartments from developers. The President said that IDPs should be provided with comfortable temporary housing for the period they need. He also called for all necessary amendments to the regulations so that new housing in Ukraine must be built with comfortable bomb shelters, and the old housing stock should be equipped in accordance with the needs of public safety. Zelenskyy also set a task to prepare plans for the reconstruction of cities, towns and communities affected by the Russian invasion. ""There will be a combination of finance, specialists and technology, which will simply be passed on to us by our partners. We need a clear ambitious plan to engage them in this project, so that they give us their architects, and we connect them with our specialists,"" the President said, urging not to wait for the end of the war. Minister of Infrastructure of Ukraine Oleksandr Kubrakov told the meeting participants that the damage caused to the infrastructure as a result of the war reached almost $90 billion.

According to Minister of Development of Communities and Territories of Ukraine Oleksiy Chernyshov, a new regional development strategy is already being shaped in the country. He said that during the reconstruction of the country, all the best world practices of urban development will be applied, taking into account the needs of energy efficiency, the availability of modern supply systems, security and inclusiveness. In addition, the Congress considered the assistance that the central government of Ukraine can provide to the temporarily occupied communities. In particular, Mayor of Melitopol Ivan Fedorov spoke about the experience in providing all necessary payments and preventing the humanitarian crisis in the city.

Authorities working to support regions in difficulty due to Russian invasion – Yermak,2022-04-27T21:53:00Z,"The President of Ukraine, his Office and all branches of government and local self-government bodies are constantly working to support regions that have found themselves in a difficult situation due to the Russian invasion. This was stated by Head of the Office of the President Andriy Yermak at a meeting of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities under the President of Ukraine, which was held as a video conference. ""I would like to say words of support to those regions that are in the most difficult situation today.

"Today we can not only successfully defend Ukraine, but also work on its postwar reconstruction – President at meeting of Congress of Local and Regional Authorities",2022-04-27T21:31:00Z,"Ukraine is beginning preparations for the reconstruction of cities, communities and infrastructure destroyed by the Russian occupiers. This was announced by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at a meeting of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities, which was held as a video conference. The head of state said that the Russian leadership, in deciding to invade Ukraine, hoped for an internal split in our country, that Ukrainians would not be able to unite for victory. But two months of resistance showed that Russian leaders were wrong. ""Every day, while the whole country is fighting against the Russian invaders, we as a central and local government with our friends and partners must spend on preparations for the postwar restoration of our state,"" Zelenskyy said. ""Preliminary estimates of Ukraine's losses from this war reach $600 billion today. More than 32 million square meters of living space, more than 1,500 educational facilities and more than 350 medical facilities have been destroyed or damaged. Economic entities suffered huge losses – hundreds of enterprises have been destroyed. About 2,500 kilometers of roads and almost 300 bridges have been ruined or damaged. And it's not just statistics. This is Mariupol, this is Volnovakha, this is Okhtyrka, this is Chernihiv, this is Borodianka and dozens or dozens of our cities, towns and villages,"" the President said. According to him, more than 11.5 million Ukrainians have fled their homes due to the fighting, and about 5 million of them have gone abroad. And 95% of migrants already want to return home. Therefore, there is an urgent need to prepare a plan to rebuild a comfortable European Ukraine. According to Zelenskyy, the task is to return normal life to the entire territory where the Russian occupiers entered and where Russian missiles hit and, unfortunately, continue hitting. He said that today he has received consent from the United Kingdom, Denmark, Japan, Italy and several other countries to join the restoration of the affected territories of Ukraine. ""The main principle of this project is that we are building with Europe and the world, rebuilding the whole country. A partnership will be established for each city and each country,"" the Head of State said. President of the National Council, the lower house of the Swiss parliament, Irène Kälin, President of the Senate of Romania Florin Cîțu, President of the Assembly of the Republic of North Macedonia Talat Xhaferi, who arrived in our country, were invited to participate in the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities. They expressed admiration for the courage of President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people and assured their comprehensive support of Ukraine, in particular in issues of postwar reconstruction. Kälin said that the programs of cooperation between Ukraine and Switzerland during the war not only did not stop, but were stepped up. Switzerland is also preparing for the Ukraine Reconstruction Conference in the summer. Cîțu said that Romania supports the European perspective of our country and is ready to contribute to the revival of Ukraine after the war. Xhaferi also emphasized great solidarity with the Ukrainian people and readiness to help our state. The audience also heard a video address by President of the European Council Charles Michel and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. Michel said that he fully shares Zelenskyy's vision of Ukraine as a powerful, modern and integral part of Europe, as well as his idea of involving individual states in the restoration and reconstruction of certain Ukrainian regions and territories. For her part, the President of the European Commission said that the role of regional elites will be important in this process, and European cities and regions are ready to share their experience with Ukrainians. Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal said that on behalf of the President, the government is preparing a plan to restore the country. ""We want not just to rebuild, but we want and will make better and more modern everything that was destroyed by Russian barbarians. It also means that there will be a major transformation of the Ukrainian economy after the war. We must build a new Ukraine together with you – strong and European,"" he said. The prime minister also said that Ukraine has managed to maintain the country administration system – central and local authorities are functioning as a single team, and local authorities are organizing the defense of their communities, providing assistance to displaced persons, and backing up the home front. According to Shmyhal, the government has allocated UAH 1.4 billion to restore critical infrastructure in five regions. Reconstruction and clearing of roads, restoration of electricity supply, demining of territories are underway – more than 85,000 explosive devices have been neutralized, he said."
Russia is trying to provoke a global price crisis but Ukrainian exports will help stabilize markets - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-04-27T20:50:00Z,"Unbreakable people of the bravest country! The 63rd day of our defense is coming to an end. A day during which a lot has been done. First, an important decision of the European Union is being prepared. The European Commission has agreed to remove all duties and quotas on Ukrainian exports for a year, as well as to suspend anti-dumping tariffs. I discussed the details of this proposal with President Ursula von der Leyen today. I am grateful to her personally and to all our European friends for this step. Right now, this will allow us to maintain the economic activity in Ukraine, our national production as much as possible. But this decision needs to be considered not only in the Ukrainian context. Sufficient export of our products to European and global markets will be a significant anti-crisis tool. Russia is trying to provoke a global price crisis. To start chaos in all basic markets and especially in the food market. Ukrainian exports will help stabilize markets. So it is beneficial not only for us, but also for all Europeans. For residents of all countries that can be affected by Russia's destructive ambitions. New partners' decisions to liberalize our exports are expected soon. We are also agreeing with the European Union on how to increase the potential of transport corridors on our western border. I spoke today with the President of Indonesia. In particular, on food security. I stressed that the threat of famine for millions of people in different countries will remain until Russia begins to seek peace with Ukraine. It is because of this war waged by Russia that dozens of states have found themselves in a situation where they cannot be sure of stability for their people. I am grateful to Indonesia for supporting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of our state, for an honest and responsible position during the UN voting. I am also grateful for the invitation to take part in this year's G20 summit. A conversation took place with the Prime Minister of Italy. I thanked Mr. Draghi for the involvement in the investigation of crimes committed by the Russian military. I informed him about the situation in the combat zones. We appreciate Italy's support for truly effective sanctions that can end the war. This week, Russia's leadership launched a new series of energy blackmail of Europeans. The decision to cut off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria is another argument in favor of the fact that no one in Europe can hope to maintain any normal economic cooperation with Russia. Russia considers not only gas, but any trade as a weapon. It is just waiting for the moment when one or another trade area can be used. To blackmail Europeans politically. Or to strengthen Russia's military machine, which sees a united Europe as a target. Hence, the sooner everyone in Europe admits that it is inadmissible to depend on Russia in trade, the sooner it will be possible to guarantee stability in European markets. A meeting of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities took place today. The first meeting during the full-scale war. A set of issues was discussed. In particular, the reconstruction of our country. We are already working on all the details so that the post-war reconstruction project can be implemented quickly and most effectively. I stressed that we expect specific requests and proposals from local authorities. So that we can talk specifically with our partners, with the European Union, with international donors. Communities must provide all information about destroyed housing, all damaged objects. We discussed how and in what order to build, how to organize the purchase of ready housing. Our goal is not just to rebuild everything that was destroyed by the occupiers. But also to solve old problems with housing queues and so on. So that all servicemen, rescuers, policemen, all who work for the state are provided with their own housing. Today in Congress we heard the reports on the earliest possible provision of housing for IDPs. On the interaction between central and local authorities in the communities that are temporarily occupied. The issues of territorial defense development and coordination between local authorities and law enforcement agencies were discussed. Today I want to especially support Ukrainians in the south of our country. In Kherson, in all communities of the region, in the temporarily occupied districts of the Zaporizhzhia region. I am grateful to everyone who does not give up. Who protests. Who ignores the occupiers and shows those outcasts who have become collaborators that they have no future. The stronger our resistance now, the more rejection the occupiers will see, the sooner normal life will return to our land. The Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to beat the invaders throughout the territory where the fighting continues. I am grateful to each of our defenders who do everything for Russia to lose. Mariupol, Marinka, Popasna, Severodonetsk, Izyum, Rubizhne, Dniprorudne, Melitopol and all other cities and communities that are now at the epicenter of the struggle for Ukraine. That is where the fighting for the future of our people is taking place. Thank you to everyone who brings our victory closer! I have just signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 173 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards of Ukraine. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Lieutenant General Serhiy Ivanovych Nayev, Commander of the Joint Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Eternal glory to everyone who stood up for our state! Eternal memory to all who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
Yermak presents Yermak-McFaul group's action plan on sanctions against Russia to ambassadors of foreign states,2022-04-27T16:33:00Z,"Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak held an online meeting with the heads of diplomatic missions of foreign states in Ukraine, dedicated to the issue of continuing a balanced, coordinated, tough and effective sanctions policy against the Russian Federation. He said that Ukraine has withstood the first, most acute phase of the Russian invasion. But to win, our state needs both the strengthening of the capabilities of the Armed Forces, first of all – weapons, and an extremely effective sanctions policy on the part of partners. ""We are not so naive as to expect that economic pressure on the aggressor country will lead to a speedy end to hostilities. However, this second front – the front of international sanctions – will significantly limit Russia's aggression. Usually, the best pacifier was economic hardship,"" the head of the President's Office said. Yermak presented to the ambassadors the Action Plan on Strengthening Sanctions against the Russian Federation, developed by the Yermak-McFaul International Expert Group established by the Head of the President's Office and Ambassador Michael McFaul following the initiative of President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to Yermak, the plan is aimed at depriving Russia of the finances, production capabilities and technologies used for the war, forcing Russia to focus on overcoming its internal problems and forcing Russian citizens to pay for supporting aggression. ""Coordinated, comprehensive and effective actions of a wide range are needed. We must force sanctions to work without failures and imitations against entire sectors of the Russian economy,"" he said. First of all, it is a question of a full oil and gas embargo, the need to introduce a scheme that will deprive Russia of access to funds for oil and gas exports. Yermak singled out comprehensive sanctions against financial institutions in Russia and Belarus, Russia's inclusion in the FATF blacklist and the list of terrorist sponsors among other points of the plan. Restrictions should also affect export-import and insurance operations and include transport measures such as the complete closure of maritime services. The head of the Office of the President also stressed the importance of increasing transparency and deepening coordination between the countries participating in the sanctions. Particular attention should be paid to the introduction of secondary sanctions mechanisms, which should be aimed at intermediaries who provide services in circumvention schemes. ""I think that weapons and sanctions policy are the most important tools from your states to support Ukraine and the whole free democratic world, which our country is defending today, to end this war,"" Andriy Yermak said. For his part, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called on states that stand side by side with Ukraine to make it a rule that there are no taboos on sanctions until Russia is stopped. The foreign minister also invited the partner countries to adopt the Yermak-McFaul Plan as a roadmap for what sanctions should be applied against Russia. He also drew attention to the importance of encouraging the business of these countries to leave the Russian Federation as soon as possible. ""Ukraine and Ukrainians are now acting decisively and sacrificing themselves for the victory in this war. We thank you for standing by us, and we ask you to do everything possible to end this war as soon as possible,"" Kuleba said."
Head of President's Office discusses new opportunities to strengthen sanctions against Russia with US national security lawyer,2022-04-27T10:39:00Z,"Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak held a video conference with former Director of the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), Attorney John E. Smith focusing on national security and sanctions. Smith and his company advise Ukraine on sanctions free of charge, focusing on blocking the Russian Federation's assets and imposing personal restrictions. ""Sanctions and weapons are very important to us. But we understand that when this terrible war continues and Russia continues to kill our people, destroy our cities, the sanctions that have already been imposed will not be enough. We know about your extensive experience and understanding of this issue, awareness of the specifics of Russia, so we will be interested to hear your opinion on opportunities to increase sanctions pressure,"" Yermak said. For his part, Smith said that he considers it an honor to work with the team of the President of Ukraine and help our country in this difficult time. He stressed the importance of establishing close and continued contact between the Ukrainian side and the administration of US President Joseph Biden. Smith noted the plan developed by the Yermak-McFaul group to strengthen sanctions against Russia. According to him, the document should be divided according to priorities in the energy and financial sectors. In addition, according to the US attorney, it is important to achieve the introduction of secondary sanctions. ""I fully agree with the identified priorities. We have the historical support of Ukraine in the United States. That is why it is important to continue this work,"" Yermak said."
Ukraine understands what is happening in Transnistria and is ready for any developments - Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-04-27T00:08:00Z,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes the Russian Federation is trying to destabilize the situation in the Transnistrian region, but the Armed Forces of Ukraine are ready for a possible escalation by Russian troops in the temporarily occupied territory of the Republic of Moldova. Answering journalists' questions after a meeting with IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi in Kyiv, the Ukrainian Head of State said that he fully shares the assessment of the situation by Moldovan President Maia Sandu. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also said that he discussed that issue with Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Ciucă who was in Kyiv on Tuesday. ""We clearly understand that this is one of the steps of the Russian Federation. The special services are working there. It's not just about fake news. The goal is obvious - to destabilize the situation in the region, to threaten Moldova. They show that if Moldova supports Ukraine, there will be certain steps,"" the President said. According to him, Ukraine knows that the Russian troops, which have been present in the territory of the temporarily occupied part of Moldova - Transnistria for many years, are in constant readiness. ""But we understand their capabilities, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are ready for this and are not afraid of them,"" the Ukrainian Head of State assured."
"We are grateful to those who saved the world from the new Chornobyl tragedy, which could have happened due to the actions of the Russian occupiers - President",2022-04-26T23:50:00Z,"On the 36th anniversary of the Chornobyl tragedy, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy presented state awards to employees of the Chornobyl NPP who provided safety at the nuclear power plant even in the difficult conditions of Russian occupation and saved the world from another man-made disaster. ""We are grateful to those who saved the world from the second catastrophe in 2022. I would like to thank the staff of the Chornobyl station and all the workers of the Exclusion Zone who worked, stayed at the station and ensured uninterrupted work at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant in truly inhumane conditions - under occupation and direct threat to their lives. In conditions when the Russian invaders turned out to be so barbaric that they did not understand where they came and what radiation safety is,” the President said during a meeting with Chornobyl workers at the Office of the President of Ukraine. ""Our specialists have worked really professionally, to the maximum, to maintain the normal operation of all Chornobyl facilities,"" he added. The President also thanked the Ukrainians who under occupation ensure the operation of the Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. ""After that terrible night, when Russian tanks fired at the buildings of the Zaporizhzhia NPP, the safety of this facility is ensured only by the professionalism and integrity of our nuclear specialists - real heroes,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. For loyalty to the Ukrainian people, significant personal contribution to overcoming the consequences of the Chornobyl disaster, courage and dedication shown in ensuring the operation of Chornobyl facilities under occupation during the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, conscientious performance of professional duties the President presented state awards to ChNPP employees."
President met with the Director General of the IAEA,2022-04-26T23:31:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Mariano Grossi who is on a visit to Ukraine. The Head of State stressed that today, on the 36th anniversary of the Chornobyl accident, it has to be said that the world is once again one step away from catastrophe due to Russia's actions. ""For the Russian military, the Chornobyl zone and the station were allegedly normal territory for hostilities. A territory where they did not even try to take care of nuclear safety,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said during a meeting with media representatives following the meeting. The President noted that the level of the nuclear threat provoked by Russia was discussed during the meeting with the IAEA Director General. ""No other country in the world since 1986 has posed such a major threat to nuclear security, to Europe and the world, that Russia has posed since February 24. Russia kept a contingent in the Chornobyl zone with armored vehicles, which destroyed the soil surface and raised an extraordinary amount of dust into the air, including radioactive particles,"" the President stressed. In addition, according to the President, the occupiers destroyed the dosimetric control points and looted the radiation monitoring system. ""In the Chornobyl zone, the Russian occupiers looted and destroyed a nuclear analytical laboratory on the territory of the Chornobyl nuclear power plant. For the Russian military, the Chornobyl zone and station were a military bridgehead, just as the bridgehead is now the territory of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. There is also a risk of catastrophe from Russia's launch of cruise missiles that fly over nuclear power plant units,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. He stressed that given the level of threat, the reaction to Russia's actions was extraordinary, and that country has no right to turn nuclear energy into weapons, as well as to blackmail the world with nuclear weapons. ""All this must be punished. We hope for the full support of the IAEA and the entire international community in our efforts to ensure nuclear safety in Ukraine, in Europe in the context of the Russian war and Russia's complete disregard for radiation safety requirements,"" said the President. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that the world must stop nuclear blackmail by Russia and restore the fundamental principles of nuclear safety and peaceful use of nuclear energy. ""We also have to work together to address a number of critical issues that were discussed today. This is a question of depriving Russia of disproportionate representation in the IAEA. I am convinced that our state has the right to be represented in the IAEA Board of Governors. We also raised the issue of Russia compensating for all the damage caused to our nuclear facilities,"" the President stressed. According to the President, Ukraine has proposed an initiative to deploy peacekeepers to ensure the security of the Zaporizhzhia NPP. “In no case can this station be transferred to Rosatom's control. We discussed all the acute issues of nuclear security that arose due to Russia's aggression against Ukraine and as a result of nuclear blackmail, which Russia has consistently resorted to during the war,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The President reminded that on the night of March 4, when the Russian occupiers seized the Zaporizhzhia NPP, he held talks with the leaders of the partner countries. ""We called everyone, we wanted a tough reaction from the world. We warned everyone that there could be a new nuclear catastrophe at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is like six Chornobyls, and that it could simply destroy Europe. We also spoke with Mr. Grossi that today we expect from the world, from its leaders, from the IAEA a firm, decisive position, an effective response that will ensure Ukraine's control over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant,"" said the President. He stressed that Ukraine will hold a dialogue with its IAEA partners and insist on measures to restore nuclear security in Europe and around the world. For his part, Rafael Mariano Grossi said that today, on the 36th anniversary of the disaster, he visited the Chornobyl nuclear power plant, where he thanked the employees of the station for their work, courage and professionalism. ""We could not imagine that this path would take us where we did not expect to end, that it is not over and that tragic events will continue in this area,"" he said. The IAEA leader stressed the importance of further cooperation and support for Ukraine in difficult times. ""My task, among other things, is to ensure that the country's nuclear power plants, which are important in the world in terms of electricity supply, are not threatened. That is why the IAEA is in Ukraine and will continue its work. Today, we agreed to provide assistance and special work to restore the capacity of the damaged infrastructure,"" said Rafael Mariano Grossi."
The free world has the right to self-defense and that is why it will help Ukraine even more - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-04-26T22:48:00Z,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! Every year on April 26, the world remembers the Chornobyl disaster. The worst nuclear disaster in human history. But this year it is not enough to just remember Chornobyl. And it is not enough to say traditional words of gratitude to the heroes-liquidators. It is not enough to remind why and how the catastrophe became possible. It is not enough to repeat the conclusions that every intelligent person and every adequate society must draw. Because this year, Russia has created new threats that could surpass even the worst accident. I remember the night of March 4, when it became known about the fire at the Zaporizhzhia NPP. When Russian tanks fired at the station. They knew exactly which object they were firing at. But they had an order to seize the object at any cost. They did not care about anything. They did not care that the Zaporizhzhia station is the largest in Europe. They didn't think about how many power units there are and how the shelling could end. That night I spoke with world leaders. With everyone who could influence the events and stop Russia. I spoke with President Biden, with Chancellor Scholz, with President of the European Council Charles Michel, with President of Poland Andrzej Duda... I spoke with IAEA Director General Mr. Grossi. If the world had not woken up that night, we would not mention Chornobyl today, because everyone would think about what Russia has done at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It is even surprising how quickly and completely Russia, the whole country, can forget about the worst catastrophe that its people have experienced as well. Not only Ukrainians were involved in the liquidation of the consequences of the Chornobyl accident in 1986. But also Belarusians, Russians and others. That catastrophe should have been told about in Russian schools as well. They should have reminded about it in Russia every year on April 26, as is done throughout the civilized world. Instead, today they launched three missiles against Ukraine so that they flew directly over the blocks of our nuclear power plants. Over three nuclear power plants at once. Over Zaporizhzhia, Khmelnytskyi and South-Ukrainian NPPs. What is it? Are they threatening? Are they targeting? There are no words... It turns out they do not realize what Chornobyl is. At all. Russian troops that were trying to attack Kyiv through the Chornobyl zone used the restricted area as a military base. They set up positions on land where it is forbidden to even stand. They drove armored vehicles through areas where radiation-contaminated materials are buried and where the number of radioactive particles is simply horrendous. They destroyed the dosimetric control points. The Chornobyl radiation monitoring system was broken and looted. They looted a nuclear analytical laboratory... They even stole contaminated items, which were confiscated from violators of the rules of the Exclusion Zone! Only thanks to the professionalism and conscientiousness of our specialists working at the Chornobyl station and other facilities of the Chornobyl zone, we managed to save Ukraine, save Europe from a new catastrophe. Only thanks to the professional team of the Zaporizhzhia NPP and our entire nuclear industry is it possible to ensure trouble-free operation of stations during the war. Mr. Grossi, Director General of the IAEA, paid a visit to Kyiv today. We discussed all the dangers created by Russia and ways to possibly influence the situation to protect Europe and the world from completely irresponsible actions of the Russian Federation. Today, I also awarded our heroes - shift workers at the Chornobyl station who did not leave the facility. Who maintained the work of the Chornobyl nuclear power plant despite the threat to their lives and despite the occupiers' lack of understanding of even the basics of radiation safety. I believe that after all that the Russian military has done in the Chornobyl zone and at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, no one in the world can feel safe knowing how many nuclear facilities, nuclear weapons and related technologies the Russian state has. If Russia has forgotten what Chornobyl is, it means that global control over Russia's nuclear facilities and nuclear technology is needed. I spoke today with the Prime Minister of Japan. In particular, about the dangers created by Russia. About the situation on the battlefield in Ukraine. I thanked Japan for a strong package of sanctions, for its support and for the leadership needed to force Russia to peace and recognition of the foundations of international law. We also discussed the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine and the possible role of Japan in future security agreements. The Prime Minister of Romania paid a visit to Kyiv. I thanked him for the defensive and political support. We discussed not only bilateral cooperation between our states and joint work to protect freedom in Europe, but also cooperation at the EU level. With Romania, we share a common vision of both prospects and threats to European unity, in particular in the Black Sea region. We agreed to work together even harder to ensure security in our region. An important meeting at the level of defense ministers of Ukraine's partner countries took place in Germany today. The key issue was to strengthen the protection of the whole of Europe from Russia's aggressive ambitions. There are almost no people left in the free world who do not understand that Russia's war against Ukraine is just the beginning. The ultimate goal of Russia's leadership is not just to seize the territory of Ukraine, but to dismember the entire center and east of Europe and deal a global blow to democracy. Therefore, the free world has the right to self-defense. And that is why it will help Ukraine even more. I am grateful to the United Kingdom and personally to Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his prompt and positive response to our request for trade liberalization. Right now it is especially important for the support of our state. Britain has announced the abolition of all duties and quotas on imports of Ukrainian goods. This will allow us to save thousands of jobs during the war and ensure a significant intensification of economic relations with Britain. We expect similar decision from other partners. I want to emphasize that this is important not only for our country, not only for each of the partner countries. This adds stability to global markets, especially the food market, which is one step away from a large-scale price crisis due to Russia's war against Ukraine. There is only one way to avoid the crisis: to strengthen cooperation and put pressure on Russia for it to give up this war. Today, Russian troops continued missile strikes at our land, particularly in the Odesa region. They continued to attack our troops near Kharkiv, in Donbas. They are trying to portray an alleged ""new government"" in Kherson and part of the Zaporizhzhia region. They change flags, demonstrate some suicides in the role of collaborators. And what does this give Russia? Only new losses. There will be a new sanctions package from the European Union. There will be even more restrictions on trade. Inevitably, the vast majority of the world's countries will abandon Russian oil and other Russian energy sources. No adequate country will want to invite Rosatom to cooperate. Most Russians will have to pay with poverty for the aggressive policy of their country's leadership. And I emphasize: we will identify, find and prosecute everyone - war criminals and collaborators. The longer and more brutal this war, the more resources will be spent not only by us, but also by the world to establish justice and punish all those responsible. The time will come when Russia will have to recognize that peace is needed. I paid a visit to Ilya Matvienko and Kira Obedinska in Okhmatdyt Hospital today. Kira is 12 years old, and Ilya turned 10 today. They lived in Mariupol until the Russian army came. Ilya's mother was killed during the bombing of the city. Kira's father, a well-known athlete and former captain of Ukraine's water polo team, Yevhen Obedinsky, was killed by a sniper. The occupiers took the children out of the city, actually abducted them, and it took a lot of effort to get them back. I am grateful to everyone who joined this cause. I am especially grateful to Iryna Vereshchuk and Andriy Yermak, who coordinated this task, to our entire team. Now Ilya is with his grandmother, Kira is with her grandfather. Their only relatives left. We will help them with everything they need. We will help raise children. And we will definitely do everything to return all our Ukrainian children to Ukraine. Let no one in Russia hope that Ukraine will forget or forgive the abduction of our children, the deportation of our citizens. And the destruction of Mariupol. I also thanked Okhmatdyt's doctors for their work. For saving lives and trying to restore children's peace of mind under all circumstances. Thank you very much, dear doctors. Before delivering the evening address, I traditionally signed a decree awarding our heroes. 243 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. Eternal gratitude to all our defenders! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
President of Ukraine held talks with the Prime Minister of Romania,2022-04-26T21:39:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Prime Minister of Romania Nicolae Ciucă who was on a visit to Kyiv. ""Your visit is an important clear signal of support for Ukraine in the war against the Russian Federation,"" the President stressed. The President of Ukraine informed the Prime Minister of Romania about the situation on the frontline, the heroic defense of Mariupol. Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the Romanian government for the assistance Romania provides to our defense forces. During the discussion of the issue of counteracting Russian aggression, it was noted that one of the critical elements of such counteraction is the sanctions pressure on the aggressor, which needs to be strengthened and which should become a key element in forcing Russia to peace. ""Thank you for your clear position on the sanctions policy against the Russian Federation during the war it unleashed on our territory,"" the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed confidence that the next, sixth package of EU sanctions against Russia should contain truly effective decisions, especially in the energy sphere. The President of Ukraine praised Bucharest's assistance in organizing a critical transit to Ukraine - international humanitarian aid, the goods we need and energy resources. Further steps were agreed to deepen such cooperation. To this end, it has been agreed to hold a separate meeting at the ministerial level soon. The Head of State noted Romania's readiness to join Ukraine's post-war development. The European integration agenda was discussed separately. Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked Nicolae Ciucă for Romania's clear support for the Ukrainian people's desire to become a full member of the European family as soon as possible. An important component of the common European future will be the absolute protection and development of our national minorities - the Ukrainian community in Romania and the Romanian community - in Ukraine. The parties also discussed other topical issues on the agenda and touched upon regional issues. Following the talks, the President expressed his conviction that Ukraine and Romania should reach a new level in all key areas of bilateral relations."
"At Okhmatdyt Hospital, Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited two orphans from Mariupol who were returned to Ukraine ",2022-04-26T20:34:00Z,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the Okhmatdyt National Children's Specialized Hospital. He visited two orphans from Mariupol who were taken out of the city by the Russian occupiers, but the Ukrainian authorities managed to return them, now they are taken care of by their relatives. As a result of active hostilities in Mariupol, Ilya Matvienko and Kira Obedinska lost their parents. The children suffered injuries of varying severity. The occupiers took them to the territory not controlled by Ukraine. The return of children was made possible by the systematic and coordinated work of all relevant authorities. The President kept this issue under constant control. ""We are most worried about the children. Children are our future. We will fight for every Ukrainian child to return home,"" the President said. At the hospital, Volodymyr Zelenskyy talked to Ilya Matvienko, who turned 10 today, and his grandmother. The boy's mother died during the bombing of Mariupol by the Russian army. The President inquired about his health and plans. Doctors told the President about the child's injuries and assured that the boy would get back on his feet. Volodymyr Zelenskyy congratulated Ilya Matvienko on his birthday. The President also visited 12-year-old Kira Obedinska. Her father, Yevhen Obedinsky, a multiple Ukrainian water polo champion and former captain of the national team, died in Mariupol. Her mother died a long time ago. Her grandfather, honored coach of Ukraine in water polo Oleksandr Obedinsky after the beginning of the Russian invasion, temporarily lives in Chernivtsi, and is currently in hospital with his granddaughter. The Head of State also met with Okhmatdyt doctors and presented state awards to them. ""Thank you for your important daily work, for saving the lives of Ukrainians. You are also on your frontline, like our military,"" he said."
Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Prime Minister of Japan Fumio Kishida discussed further steps to support Ukraine ,2022-04-26T18:19:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy had a phone conversation with Prime Minister of Japan Fumio Kishida. The Head of State noted the symbolism of the conversation on the day of the 36th anniversary of the Chornobyl tragedy. ""Today, during the aggression against Ukraine, Russia resorts to ""nuclear terrorism"", as evidenced by the seizure of the Chornobyl nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and the threat of using nuclear weapons,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. In this context, it was noted that Japan understands the price of nuclear tragedies better than anyone else. The President thanked for the consistent position of Japan in support of Ukraine and for the personal active role of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. ""We appreciate Japan's clear position in increasing sanctions pressure on Russia, as well as humanitarian and financial support for Ukraine in overcoming the consequences of large-scale Russian aggression,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The interlocutors exchanged views on additional measures that Japan could take to support international efforts to counter Russian aggression. The Head of State noted the importance of joint efforts to strengthen the international anti-war coalition and expressed hope that Japan would be one of the parties to the future security agreements on Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also invited Japan to join the post-war reconstruction of our country."
Ukraine is a real symbol of struggle for freedom - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-04-25T23:07:00Z,"Unbreakable people of the bravest country in the world! Today the third month of our war for our independence began. Russian-Ukrainian war. The third month! On February 24, most in the world did not even believe that we would withstand more than a week. Someone said - three days. A month ago, we still had to convince different countries that betting on Ukraine means winning. And now... Now everyone knows it. Thanks to the courage, wisdom of our defenders, thanks to the courage of all Ukrainian men, all Ukrainian women our state is a real symbol of struggle for freedom. Everyone in the world - and even those who do not openly support us - agree that it is in Ukraine that the fate of Europe, the fate of global security, the fate of the democratic system is being decided. And above all, it is being decided what life in the center and east of our continent will be like and whether there will be life at all. Bucha, Borodyanka, Hostomel, Okhtyrka, Chernihiv and Sumy, Izyum, Kharkiv, Volnovakha, Zolote, Severodonetsk, Rubizhne, Popasna and Mariupol... Missiles aimed at Odesa and Kramatorsk, Zhytomyr, Lviv, Kremenchuk and Kryvyi Rih... In all Ukraine's cities and communities, Russia has shown what it really wants and can bring to Europe. What it can bring to Chișinău, Tbilisi, Helsinki, Vilnius, Warsaw, Prague, all the cities and countries that Russian state propagandists have long openly identified as alleged enemies for Moscow. Russia has launched an offensive against Ukraine in many directions. Missile strikes, air raids, artillery, tanks - everything! Russian troops did not spare anything, any means to kill us, kill Ukrainians and destroy our land. In two months, they used more than 1100 missiles against us. Countless bombs and artillery. They tortured, robbed, executed. They mined our land. Peaceful cities and villages were turned into hell. Some Ukrainian cities and communities were destroyed to the ground. But they did not achieve anything. And they will not achieve. Kherson, Kakhovka, Melitopol, Dniprorudne, Enerhodar and our other cities where the Russian occupiers temporarily entered didn't obey them. People showed with their protest their attitude towards the occupiers, showed that Ukraine will definitely win. Russia wants to play a sham ""referendum"" somewhere on our land? Even if they try, it will be as shameful as everything else that was ""created"" in Moscow for the occupation of Ukraine. Kharkiv region, Donetsk, Luhansk - the Russian military didn’t see even the slightest support they had hoped for anywhere. But they saw that it is a completely different state. They saw that there are completely different people here. People who are confident. Who believe in their state. Who know how to respect others because they respect themselves. Who do not want to capture someone else’s land, but will not give anything of their own. Who will protect every city, every street, every field. In two months of hostilities 9 thousand 781 defenders of Ukraine were awarded state awards. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to 142 of our defenders. Ukrainian men and women have shown a truly massive readiness to defend Ukraine. At any age, any property status, with any education - Ukrainian men and women equally stood up for the state. This war has truly become a people’s war for Ukraine. And it showed that throughout our territory - from east to west, from north to south - the Ukrainian idea is equally strong, equally national. As of this time, 931 settlements have already been de-occupied. Many cities and communities are still under the temporary control of the Russian army. But I have no doubt that it is only a matter of time before we liberate our land. Russia can spend enormous resources to support the war. To oppose even the whole free world. It can take away from its people everything that could develop Russia itself, and direct this potential to destroy the lives of neighbors. But the lessons of history are well known. If you are going to build a millennial Reich, you lose. If you are going to destroy the neighbors, you lose. If you want to restore the old empire, you lose. And if you go against the Ukrainians, you lose. A global anti-war coalition was formed in two months. Sanctions have already been imposed on Russia, which have taken away its future. Ukraine receives assistance from dozens of countries. This is support in the form of weapons, finances, necessary goods, political support directly. We are accelerating our movement to the European Union as much as possible. We have already passed a historic moment, an important stage - with the receipt and answering a special questionnaire, which was provided to each country before they acquired the status of a candidate for EU membership. Even now, when the war is still going on, we are creating the necessary base for the reconstruction of Ukraine. These are international agreements of various levels, this is the creation of special funds for the reconstruction of our state. Even now, when Russia is still trying to seize our territory, we are demonstrating that we will give free Ukraine more opportunities for development than Russia can give not only to the occupied part of our territory, but also to its own territory, its own state. It is obvious that every day - and especially today, when the third month of our resistance has begun - everyone in Ukraine is concerned about peace. About when all this will be over. About when and what can be a victory for Ukraine. There is and at the same time there is no simple answer to this question. When we gain a victory, everyone will feel it. When peace comes, everyone will see it. But for this to happen - and happen faster - we need to think not about when and what it will be. We must think every day about how to make the stay of the occupiers on our land even more unbearable. Ukraine is ready for peace. It was ready even when the war was going on in Donbas. It is ready even now, when the Russian invasion has become full-scale. But for Russia to seek peace, every Ukrainian must still fight. They must defend freedom. Because every day of struggle now adds years of peaceful life after this war. After our victory. As always, before delivering the address, I signed decrees awarding our heroes. 269 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and 9 servicemen of the Main Intelligence Directorate were awarded state awards. Eternal glory to all who stood up for the state! Eternal gratitude to all who help us endure! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
Andriy Yermak held a meeting on the creation of the Book of Torturers to bring to justice all Russian war criminals,2022-04-25T21:29:00Z,"Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak held a meeting on the issue of bringing to justice those Russian war criminals who have committed and continue to commit crimes on the territory of Ukraine. He reminded that a strong team of lawyers has been formed in our country, which prepares lawsuits in international courts. At the same time, according to Andriy Yermak, it is necessary to create a system to identify all these criminals and obtain the necessary information about them. In particular, the so-called Book of Torturers has already been initiated - a collection of information about every Russian war criminal involved in atrocities in Ukraine. ""The main goal, as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said many times, and I think this is the opinion of every Ukrainian today: everyone who has committed these horrible crimes in our country, wherever he may be, must be punished,"" stressed the Head of the Office of the President. Andriy Yermak noted that all the necessary resources of our country and foreign partners who strongly support Ukraine in this issue will be involved in this. Deputy Head of the Office of the President Andriy Smyrnov believes that now it is necessary to synchronize the efforts of all pre-trial investigation bodies in the exchange of information obtained about specific war criminals - both privates and officers of the enemy army. The process of identifying and verifying the data obtained must continue until the last of these criminals is identified."
"Russians continue to destroy Ukrainian cities and kill people, so it is clear that the existing sanctions are not enough - Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine",2022-04-25T18:23:00Z,"To stop the war, it is necessary to continue to support Ukraine, including with weapons, as well as to increase sanctions pressure on Russia and those who adopt terrible decisions to exterminate Ukrainians. This was stated by Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak in an interview with Fox News. He thanked the American people and the US leadership for the assistance to our country, in particular for the recent decision on $ 800 million in defense support. ""There has never been such international support in our history. This is a historic moment. First of all, for the world, which has demonstrated that unity is possible,"" Andriy Yermak said. At the same time, he stressed that the war continues and the Ukrainian state needs further assistance. ""At the moment we do not have enough (weapons - ed.). We keep getting them. I hope that at the most important moment we will be ready, and our partners will do everything that was agreed and on time. Sometimes in life it is important to receive things on time,"" said the Head of the Office of the President. According to him, Ukraine needs MiG fighters, but will also welcome F-16s or other new aircraft. Andriy Yermak stressed that the war continues, the Russians continue to destroy Ukrainian cities and kill people: military and civilians, including women and children. ""Therefore, it is clear that the existing sanctions are not enough,"" he said. According to the Head of the Office of the President, an international expert group has been set up at the initiative of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, co-chaired by Andriy Yermak and Director of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies (FSI), Former US National Security Adviser Michael McFaul. The main goal of this group is to analyze the sanctions imposed on Russia and develop proposals to increase sanctions pressure. In particular, he noted, the group of experts came to the conclusion that it is necessary to impose a full embargo on Russian energy and sanctions against all Russian banks. It is also necessary to expand the circle of individuals subject to sanctions, as many Russians support the war, in particular by participating in decision-making and carrying out orders to exterminate the civilian population of Ukraine. ""Recognition of Russia as a state - sponsor of terrorism will allow launching additional sanctions mechanisms. After all, the main goal of any sanctions is to stop the war. It is important to put pressure on Russia, on Russian business close to the Kremlin in order to stop the adoption of heinous decisions,"" the Head of the President's Office said. Andriy Yermak is convinced that the Ukrainians will definitely win, but the support of friends is important in the war. ""Our victory will be common. This will be the greatest victory of Ukraine and at the same time the victory of the United States. Probably that in the future this struggle will be called Ukraine's war for freedom,"" he concluded."
Ukraine has prepared the necessary documents for the launch of a special tribunal on the crime of aggression as soon as possible - Andriy Smyrnov,2022-04-25T13:35:00Z,"Ukraine has promptly prepared the relevant legal framework, draft statutory documents for the earliest possible launch of a special tribunal to investigate the crime of aggression against our state. This was stated during a briefing by Deputy Head of the President's Office Andriy Smyrnov. ""Currently, consultations are being held with partner states and international organizations, and the optimal format for the establishment and operation of the tribunal is being determined,"" he said. The Deputy Head of the Office of the President noted that the idea of establishing a special tribunal on the crime of aggression against Ukraine was supported by hundreds of European and world intellectuals, leading international lawyers, public figures who signed a statement on the need to establish it. According to Andriy Smyrnov, daily work on the Book of Torturers is being carried out in coordination with the President's Office together with the Ukrainian pre-trial investigation bodies, intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Digital Transformation. This is a set of information about every Russian war criminal involved in the war and atrocities committed and being committed in Ukraine. ""A huge amount of information is being researched and verified, which will later be available to our citizens and the entire civilized world,"" said the Deputy Head of the Office of the President. In addition, according to him, the Office of the President together with the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine have developed mechanisms to recover funds from the Russian Federation frozen abroad to compensate for losses. ""We have several plans to achieve this. The main one is the signing of an international agreement, which will provide for the lifting of immunity from the funds of the Russian Federation and directing them to the affected citizens and legal entities, as well as the restoration of infrastructure. Plan B is the enactment of the relevant law in each jurisdiction where funds have been frozen. In some countries, such bills have already been registered,"" said Andriy Smyrnov. He noted that the relevant talks with international partners will be held this week."
50 pupils of the Kramatorsk Center for Social and Psychological Rehabilitation of Children were evacuated to Switzerland,2022-04-25T12:44:00Z,"50 pupils of the Kramatorsk Center for Social and Psychological Rehabilitation of Children were evacuated to the Swiss Confederation. This is the second group of orphans, children deprived of parental care and children in difficult life circumstances who are evacuated to this country at the initiative of the First Lady of Ukraine Olena Zelenska and at the invitation of the Administration of the canton of Bern in Switzerland.. Children aged 4 to 16 and their educators first went to Ivano-Frankivsk, then to Budapest. There they were met with equipped buses by pediatricians and social workers from Switzerland. Children will be accommodated in the canton of Bern. For them, the local representatives will organize the study of the German language, common in this region of the country, provide rehabilitation and education in local schools. ""Every year in their native Kramatorsk, these children have been finding new families who love them. Just before the war, one of the little pupils found a new family. But they did not have time to take her away - the adoption procedure was suspended for the duration of the hostilities. But we promise her that she will meet with her chosen parents immediately after our victory. Meanwhile, this girl and other children will fall asleep and wake up without sirens and alarms in the Swiss Alps,"" said Olena Zelenska. Prior to that, 25 children from the Kamyanka Specialized Orphanage have already settled in Switzerland. The evacuation program is implemented thanks to the Embassy of Ukraine in Switzerland, the National Social Service of Ukraine, regional military administrations, the Swiss Migration Office (Staatssekretariat für Migration, SEM), the administrations of the cantons of Vaud and Bern. It is expected that the evacuation of children from Ukrainian orphanages to safe countries will continue in the near future."
The one who finances the Russian Federation is the accomplice of war crimes committed by Russia - Oleg Ustenko,2022-04-25T12:11:00Z,"Economic Adviser to the President Oleg Ustenko is confident that European countries that continue to buy Russian oil and gas, and the London lawyers and bankers who serve the oligarchs from the entourage of Russian President Vladimir Putin are also complicit in war crimes committed by Russian soldiers in Ukraine. He stated this in an exclusive interview with the Observer. Oleg Ustenko considers the failure of major western economies to impose an immediate embargo on imports of oil and gas from Russia unacceptable. According to him, Kyiv is monitoring which companies continue to trade with Russia, and this will have legal consequences. “We know the name of the ship, the flag, the name of the captain, the volume of oil, we know how much money was paid for that oil, the port of destination, the company who sold the insurance. We are going to work with this information,” the Adviser to the President noted. “If Russians are committing war crimes, even genocide, whoever is supplying Russia with this bloody money is guilty of the same war crime,” he emphasized. Therefore, according to Oleg Ustenko, Ukraine will have the absolute right to prosecute such accomplices. “Maybe in a year, maybe in 10 years, but we are going to find these accomplices of war crimes,” the Adviser to the President said. He called for the imposition of much tougher international sanctions on Russia, as well as for immediate measures to direct the frozen assets of the Russian Central Bank to cover Ukraine's urgent needs. The sale of frozen assets belonging to oligarchs subject to sanctions must also begin as soon as possible with the proceeds going towards Ukraine's defense and its postwar reconstruction. ""We will both win and rebuild our country. We need funds for this, and Russia must compensate every hryvnia of our losses,"" he said. In addition, in an interview with The Guardian Oleg Ustenko said that the death, destruction and atrocities committed by the Russian army in Ukraine should be a convincing argument for the West, in particular for Europe, in favor of giving up Russian oil and gas and strengthening punitive sanctions against the Kremlin. He estimates that Moscow receives about $ 1.4 billion a day from the sale of energy, with most of the money coming from Europe. “Imagine how many missiles and bombs you can buy for that kind of money,” the Adviser to the President said. According to him, some people in Europe still have extremely narrow thinking. They believe they can help Ukraine, but they do not understand that by supplying this money to Vladimir Putin, they are funding his military machine. Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany Annalena Baerbock promised last week that Berlin would end imports of Russian oil by the end of the year, phasing gas out later. Oleg Ustenko calls this schedule “unacceptable”. According to him, an immediate oil embargo would mean short-term fuel price inflation, followed by a market correction as supplies from other nations kicked in.  For gas, Oleg Ustenko admits the transition would be harder. In the meantime, he adds, payments to Russian gas suppliers should be held in escrow, to be unlocked when the war is over. This would choke off Russia's revenue stream and provide a financial incentive to end the aggression."
The Orthodox world has seen that Easter means nothing to Russia - address by the President of Ukraine,2022-04-25T10:58:00Z,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! Yesterday, Christians of the Eastern rite celebrated Easter. The traditional greeting ""Christ is risen!"" sounded also in Russia. But did these words mean the same thing as in the whole Orthodox world? Russia ""congratulated"" Ukraine on Easter with an air threat almost all over our country, a missile strike at the Poltava region, and a missile strike at Kremenchuk. Why was this attack needed at Easter? There is no military threat from which this could protect Russia. This is just a deliberate destruction of life in Ukraine. Destruction that did not stop even on the greatest Orthodox holiday. So are these people who continued to shell our cities and communities yesterday Christians? Who fired at Chuhuiv of the Kharkiv region. Who killed two more children in the Donetsk region on Easter - girls aged five and fourteen. Killing children, destroying lives, covering up with cynical and total lies what has been done against peaceful cities - all Russia is doing on the territory of Ukraine - is definitely not Christianity. This is what Christ opposed. People who once again refused to open humanitarian corridors from Mariupol are not Christians. People who filmed propaganda reports in the occupied regions of Ukraine about the distribution of alleged humanitarian Easter kits are not Christians. Moreover, everyone knows, including in Russia, that before February 24, all Ukrainians in all parts of Ukraine had the opportunity to celebrate Easter freely in any church and without any ""humanitarian"" kits. People who are trying to build a brutal occupation regime in the seized districts of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, holding people hostage, torturing people are not Christians. Those who did not allow people to leave the occupied territory even on Easter, threatening them with death. Russia was offered an Easter ceasefire. But the Orthodox world has seen that for the Russian invaders Easter means nothing. For them, it is just a red date in the calendar, which requires special words, special behavior, but not what is called faith, and not what is called Christian good. The Russian army has made this Easter red not only formally in the calendar, but also red with blood. Christians would not do that if they had the opportunity to make peace. So holding a candle in the temple does not mean being a Christian. Eating or even celebrating Easter every year is not enough to be human, to be a Christian. And I am grateful to all our police officers, to all employees of the Security Service of Ukraine, to all those who were responsible for security on Easter, for not allowing any provocations yesterday. All that Russian propagandists announced recently. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are deterring attacks by Russian troops in key areas. In the Kharkiv region - in the Izyum direction, in Donbas - especially near Popasna, in Mariupol where the resistance of the city's defenders continues, in the southern areas, where the occupiers are trying to go on the offensive. Air alarms this morning were heard again almost all over our country. Vinnytsia, Rivne, Lviv, Odesa regions - missile threat. Russia does not stop trying to break our resistance to... Achieve what? In the occupied areas, either a humanitarian catastrophe has already occurred or there is very little time left before it occurs. There is a lack of basic products, there is a lack of medicines. People do not have the means to live normally, there is no basic security. They don't have everything they had before February 24. What Donetsk and Luhansk had before 2014. Everything that we will definitely return after the liberation of our land. We continue to do everything to drive the occupiers out and restore peace to all our people. A key element of this process is the strength of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Availability of sufficient quantity and quality of weapons, sufficient quantity and quality of ammunition. Assistance to Ukraine was the number one issue in talks with representatives of the United States of America who arrived in Kyiv yesterday - Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. Our talks with them were long enough - more than three hours - and meaningful. Encouraging and, which is important, effective. I am grateful to the people of the United States and personally to President Biden for the strong and sincere support we receive. These are real things that strengthen not only our state, but democracy as a whole. We share the same understanding with the United States: when democracy wins in one country, it wins all over the world. When freedom is defended in one country, it is defended all over the world. We agreed with the American side on further steps to strengthen the Armed Forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army. This includes preparations for a major ministerial meeting in Germany on Tuesday, which will bring together forty defense ministers from partner countries. The key issue is the protection of Ukraine, the protection of freedom in Eastern Europe. Ways to strengthen sanctions were discussed. The fact that Russia is not looking for peace and is demonstratively killing even on Easter shows that greater sanctions pressure is needed. It is necessary to block all opportunities for Russia to circumvent sanctions. So we handed over to our partners a special Plan to strengthen sanctions on the Russian Federation developed by an international expert group led by Andriy Yermak and Michael McFaul. A separate point of the negotiations was financial support for Ukraine. When tyranny has enormous financial resources from oil and gas exports, the issue of financial support for freedom becomes vital. I heard a full understanding of this position from American friends. Not only in the context of helping Ukraine now, during the war, but also for the post-war reconstruction. Discussions on security guarantees for Ukraine continued. I am convinced that the United States can be a leader among the future countries - guarantors of Ukraine's security. The main goal for all of us is to make Europe and the world safer after the war, to ensure that the security architecture works in the event of any new threats. I was pleased to hear from our friends that the United States Embassy will be back in Kyiv in the near future. The appointment of a new US Ambassador to Ukraine will also take place. This is a very useful gesture of support for our state. I had an important conversation with Turkish President Erdoğan. On the situation in Mariupol and the need to evacuate civilians and the wounded, the need for immediate exchange of the blocked Ukrainian military. We discussed the negotiation process with Russia and the issues of defense. The threats to the world food market provoked by Russia, which has blocked our Black Sea ports, were also discussed in detail. Rising food prices have already reached critical levels in many countries. But this is just the beginning. If Russia does not seek peace, the issue of food security in many countries will become a matter of physical survival for millions of people and, consequently, stability of state systems. More and more political leaders around the world are aware of this threat. So we expect more pressure on Russia. I congratulated President of France Macron on winning the elections. We spoke with Mr. President at night. Ukraine will always appreciate his support, and will always be grateful for the help of France. I am convinced that together with France, together with President Macron, we will be able to do much more to protect our common freedom, our united Europe. Late last night, after all foreign policy issues, I signed important decrees to award our heroes. 188 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and five employees of the Security Service of Ukraine were awarded state awards of Ukraine. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Colonel Chayuk Denys Valentynovych, deputy commander of the 128th separate mountain assault brigade, for personal courage and effectiveness in battles with the occupiers, for destroying enemy equipment and manpower. Glory to all our heroes! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
President of Ukraine met with the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense of the United States of America,2022-04-25T09:08:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin who arrived in Ukraine on a visit. At the beginning of the talks, Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed the importance of the visit of American high-ranking officials to Kyiv at this crucial and important moment for the Ukrainian state. ""We appreciate the unprecedented assistance of the United States to Ukraine. I would like to thank President Biden personally and on behalf of the entire Ukrainian people for his leadership in supporting Ukraine, for his personal clear position. To thank all the American people, as well as the Congress for their bicameral and bipartisan support. We see it. We feel it,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. The President of Ukraine discussed with the United States delegation the current priorities for the belligerent state - defense assistance, strengthening sanctions on Russia, financial support for Ukraine and security guarantees. The Head of State noted that the $ 3.4 billion in defense support already provided by the United States is the largest contribution to strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities. The President of Ukraine stressed that this assistance already helps in bringing Ukraine's defense capabilities to a qualitatively new level, which is extremely important for our defenders who are defending their homeland on the frontline. Particular attention was paid to the sanctions policy, which should be further strengthened and become an important element of influence on the aggressor. ""We understand what the next steps on this track should be. And we count on the support of our partners,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, handing over to the American side the Action Plan to strengthen sanctions on the Russian Federation developed by the Yermak-McFaul international expert group. Discussing ways to increase financial support for Ukraine, both to promote the economy and to further rebuild our country, the President of Ukraine stressed the importance of expanding the opportunities for Ukrainian goods to access the American market. The parties also discussed the peace process and prospects for strengthening the anti-war coalition. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that Ukraine sees the United States as a leader among the future guarantors of our country's security."
"With defensive support and a strong sanctions policy, we will surely win - Head of the President's Office",2022-04-24T11:15:00Z,"Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak expects an increase in the defensive support for our country from international partners, as well as increased sanctions pressure on Russia, which will allow to end the aggressive war and sit down at the negotiating table. He told it on French TV channel TF1. ""Currently, Mariupol remains the most tragic and tense point on the map of Ukraine. That's where the fierce fighting is taking place. As for the information that the Russians have gained control of the city... No, that's not true. Yes, they are in the city, but the area where the Ukrainian heroes stand remains under the control of our soldiers. They are there together with civilians, there are even children there,"" Andriy Yermak said. He stressed that the Ukrainian authorities continue to fight and do everything to save the lives of these people. According to him, the military-political leadership of the country is in constant contact with the fighters who remain in Mariupol, and receives firsthand information about the situation in the city. ""The struggle for Mariupol does not end. This is a Ukrainian city. And it will always be like that,"" said the Head of the President's Office. Andriy Yermak confirmed that Ukraine will now need heavy weapons to counter Russia more effectively. ""This is something that will allow us to protect our sky during the constant bombing. These are tanks. These are remedies against ship attacks. MLRS and more. But I would like to emphasize once again that our partners have an exhaustive list. We look forward to even greater support. With this support and a strong sanctions policy, we will surely win,"" he said. Andriy Yermak reminded that a group of international and Ukrainian experts has been set up pursuant to the instructions of President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy who are analyzing the effectiveness of the current sanctions and developing proposals for new restrictive measures. An action plan to strengthen sanctions on the Russian Federation developed by the Yermak-McFaul international group of experts has already been presented. ""It contains clear, definite sanctions that we will propose to our partners - the EU and its member states, as well as the United States, Great Britain and other countries - to apply against Russia. The fact that the war in Ukraine continues, our people, our children are being killed, makes it clear that the current sanctions policy is insufficient. It needs to be strengthened. It needs to be updated, new sanctions need to be developed constantly. And I would like to emphasize that the EU's support for a full embargo on energy, Russian gas and oil, is very important to us. Also the application of sanctions against all Russian banks. It is important to elaborate sanctions recognizing Russia as a country that sponsors terrorism. Also, in my opinion, the issue of including Russia in the FATF blacklist should be considered, following the example of other countries to which such measures have already been applied. And much more,"" Andriy Yermak said. The Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine also noted that in a situation where a full-scale war is being waged against our state virtually throughout the territory, it is difficult to negotiate with an aggressor who ignores not only international law, but also the laws of war."
Easter congratulations by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-04-24T09:09:00Z,"Great people of great Ukraine! Today is a great holiday. And I'm in a great place. The Great St. Sophia Cathedral. In the cathedral, which was founded a thousand years ago, on the field of the sacred battle where the army of Kyivan Rus'-Ukraine defeated the Pechenegs. In the cathedral, which was not destroyed by the Horde invasion or the Nazi occupation, which withstood in spite of everything! Today we all believe in a new victory for Ukraine. And we are all convinced that we will not be destroyed by any horde or evil. We are enduring dark times. And on this bright day, most of us are not in bright clothes. But we are fighting for a bright idea. On the bright side. And the truth, people, the Lord and the holy heavenly light are on our side. The power of the patron saint of the human race - Oranta. She is above me. She is above us all. The unshakable pillar of the Church of Christ, the unbreakable wall of the main stronghold - Kyiv, the Unbreakable Wall of the State. As long as there is Oranta, there is Sophia, and Kyiv stands with her, and the whole of Ukraine stands with them! Above the image of Oranta are the words from the Psalms: “God dwells in that city; it cannot be destroyed. From the very break of day, God will protect it."" On this Great Day, we all believe that our dawn is coming soon. Oranta in Latin means ""one who prays"". We have all been praying for the last two months. And in the Resurrection of Christ, which symbolizes the great victory of life over death, each of us asks the Lord for one thing. And speaks the same words to heaven. The words of a great and united prayer. Great and Only God! Save our Ukraine! Protect those who protect us! Heaven, protect those who defend the native land. Strengthen the will of those who protect us from captivity. Save those who save Ukraine. These are our military, national guards, border guards, our territorial defense, intelligence. These and all our other warriors of light. Help those who help them. These are volunteers and all people who care. From Ukraine and around the world. Give strength to all who give all their strength. May everyone who seeks always find. May everyone who is on the road always overcome it. And may everyone who does everything possible to save Ukraine never lose faith that everything is possible. Save the lives of those who save the lives of others. These are all our medics. Our firefighters, rescuers, sappers. May the victory of life be a symbol not only of this holiday. May life win the battle against death every day. Take care of our mothers. Give endurance to those who are waiting for a son or daughter from the war. Give fortitude to those who, unfortunately, have lost their children on the frontline. Help those who have lost their children in peaceful cities and villages where Russia has brought death to overcome unbearable pain. And give good health to all our mothers and all our grandmothers for many more years. To see their loved ones. To see peace and victory. To see justice. And the happy old age that the invaders are trying to steal from them. And instead of knitting scarves and sweaters for their grandchildren, today they weave camouflage nets. So give many years of peaceful life to them. And to our fathers. And to our grandfathers. Who once told their grandchildren about the war, and today send grandchildren to the war. Our fathers and our grandfathers built this country. Today they see it being destroyed. Let them see how our land will be liberated and rebuilt. And give us strength to do it. Take care of all our children. Give every boy and every girl a happy youth, maturity and old age, which will allow at least a little to get rid of the memories of their terrible childhood during the war. Not children's, scary games that they were forced to play. Hide and seek, but in the basement, from the bombs. Running, but from the gunshots. Travel, but because of the loss of home, fleeing the war. Save all Ukrainians! We did not attack anyone, so give us protection. We have never destroyed other nations, so do not let anyone destroy us. We did not seize other people's lands, so do not let anyone seize ours. Save Ukraine! Its right and left banks - at a time when we are being viciously beaten on both right and left cheeks. At the end of winter, spring did not come to us. Severe cold was brought to our house. At dawn we were brought opaque darkness. We believe, God, that in your judgment you will not forget them all. All those who have forgotten all your commandments. You will not forget about Bucha, Irpin, Borodyanka, Hostomel. All those who survived brutal crimes. Give them and all our land human happiness. You will not forget about Chernihiv, Mykolaiv, Kherson, Sumy, Kharkiv, Izyum, Kramatorsk and Volnovakha, Popasna. All other towns and villages that hear the terrible explosions. Let them and all of us hear the fireworks of victory. You will not forget about Mariupol and its heroic defenders. One can destroy the walls, but can't destroy the foundation on which the morale stands. The morale of our warriors. The morale of the whole country. We see terrible scenes of war. Let us see a happy picture of peace. We are going through very difficult ordeals. Let us reach a just end on this path - the beginning of a happy life and prosperity of Ukraine! Our hearts are full of fierce fury. Our souls are full of fierce hatred for the invaders and all that they have done. Don't let fury destroy us from within. Turn it into our accomplishments from the outside. Turn it into a force of good to defeat the forces of evil. Save us from strife and division. Don't let us lose unity. Strengthen our will and our spirit. Don't let us lose ourselves. Don't let us lose our longing for freedom. Therefore, do not let us lose our zeal for a righteous struggle. Do not let us lose hope of victory and self-esteem, and therefore our freedom. And therefore Ukraine. And therefore faith. Dear Ukrainians! Last year we celebrated Easter at home because of the pandemic. This year we also celebrate the Resurrection of Christ not as we used to. Because of another virus. Because of the plague called war. Both last year's and the current threat are united by one thing - nothing can defeat Ukraine. The great holiday today gives us great hope and unwavering faith that light will overcome darkness, good will overcome evil, life will overcome death, and therefore Ukraine will surely win! And on Easter, we ask God for great grace to make our great dream come true - this is another great day - the day when great peace will come to Ukraine. And with it - eternal harmony and prosperity. With faith and confidence in this - I congratulate all of you on Easter. Take care of yourselves. Take care of your loved ones. Take care of Ukraine! Christ is Risen! He is Risen Indeed."
It is only a matter of time before all Russian murderers receive a fair response to their crimes - address by the President of Ukraine,2022-04-24T00:24:00Z,"Today I will begin my evening address to you without greetings. Today Russia launched another missile strike at Ukraine, at Odesa. As of now - 8 dead. At least 18 wounded. Ordinary peaceful people. Among those killed was a 3-month-old baby girl. How did she threaten Russia? It seems that killing children is just a new national idea of the Russian Federation. The missiles were launched by Russian strategic aircraft. From the Caspian Sea region. We managed to shoot down two missiles. Five more missiles hit a peaceful city. Including the usual apartment house, the usual high-rise building. We will identify all those responsible for this strike. Those responsible for Russia's missile terror. Everyone who gives these orders. Everyone who fulfills these orders. No one will be able to hide. No matter how long it takes us, all these bastards will be responsible for every death they caused. Russia has already fired most of its missile arsenal at Ukraine. Of course, they still have missiles. Of course, they can still continue the missile terror against our people. But what they have already done is definitely arguments sufficient for the world to eventually recognize the Russian state as a sponsor of terrorism and the Russian army as a terrorist organization. We will continue to insist on this in negotiations with our partners. There is simply no alternative to such recognition. That is why it is true. The Russian state has become a terrorist, and it is not ashamed. And if it is not ashamed, it is deliberate. Therefore, there must be maximum responsibility. New facts about the crimes of the occupiers against our Mariupol residents are being revealed. New graves of people killed by the occupiers are being found. We are talking about tens of thousands of dead Mariupol residents. Negotiations of the occupiers on how they conceal the traces of their crimes are recorded. Russia continues the activities of so-called filtration camps, particularly near Mariupol. Although the honest name for them is, in fact, different - it's concentration camps. Like those built by the Nazis in the past. Ukrainians from these camps - the survivors - are sent further into the occupied territories and to Russia. The facts of deportation of our citizens to the Russian boondocks, to Siberia, even to Vladivostok are recorded. They also deport children hoping that they will forget where their home is and where they are from. And they are from Ukraine. Today was Holy Saturday for Christians of the Eastern Rite. The day between the Crucifixion and the Resurrection. It seems that Russia is stuck on such a day. For years. On the day when death triumphs and God is supposedly gone. But there will be a Resurrection. Life will defeat death. The truth will defeat any lies. And evil will be punished. And Russia will have to learn these truths again, it's only a matter of time. It is only a matter of time before all Russian murderers feel what a fair response to their crimes is. It is only a matter of time before we can bring all the deported Ukrainians home. It is only a matter of time before all our people all over Ukraine feel what a strong peace is. I spoke today with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson. I informed him about the situation in Mariupol, in the areas of hostilities in general. I thanked him for the significant defensive and financial support for Ukraine. We coordinated further steps needed to protect our freedom. We are also preparing for tomorrow's important talks with American partners. I held a big live press conference in Kyiv today. Answered many questions - different, from different journalists. Both Ukrainian and foreign. And it's not just about openness, really. Not just about information. It's about whose side the truth is on in the war. This is about who can speak truthfully both with his people and with the whole world. Ukrainians can. Our enemies cannot. And finally. There will be a curfew tonight. Please follow this rule. This is important from a security point of view. But starting from 5 am you will be able to visit temples in your cities, towns and communities. Where it is possible to hold a church service. Please - only in the morning. I am grateful to each of our defenders who ensure our security this night before Easter and every day. Who defend the state. Who fight for the freedom of Ukrainians. Eternal glory to all our warriors! Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!"
"Ukraine has demonstrated extraordinary unity, as well as united Europe and shown the true meaning of NATO - Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-04-24T00:10:00Z,"Ukraine and Ukrainian citizens not only demonstrated great internal unity, but also managed to unite European countries and the whole world around them. This was emphasized by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a press conference for international and Ukrainian media in Kyiv. The Head of State noted the incredible unity within the country after the beginning of the war. ""And it must stay with us until the end of the war, after the war… I think this is a great victory and our great weapon,"" he said. The President is convinced that Ukraine has done everything possible to unite the countries of the European Union politically like never before. ""We addressed the parliaments. And sometimes, may some European countries excuse me, behaved impudently. But understand: because we are at war and our people are dying, we can't do otherwise - there is not enough time,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. According to the Head of State, thanks to Ukraine, European countries have begun to understand the true meaning of NATO's existence, as some European high-ranking officials have said in private conversations. ""Is the Alliance able to unite quickly and resist aggression?"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He stressed that Ukraine is fighting for its existence and for peace, but it needs powerful weapons for this. ""Ukraine has done a lot to unite the world. And now that this union exists, weapons are needed. And this is the last union we need. Here, all countries need to become courageous people and courageous leaders together. And not only for us, not only for our victory, but also for themselves,"" the President of Ukraine summed up."
Ukraine is interested in Pope Francis' involvement in saving people - Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-04-23T22:41:00Z,"Ukraine would like Pope Francis to join the rescue of people in the east of our country, in particular to help unblock the humanitarian corridor in Mariupol, because His Holiness is trusted by many people and his mission is from God. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a press conference for international and Ukrainian media in Kyiv. ""I really wanted him to come from the very beginning, to support our people in the east of the country. I wanted him to try to unblock the humanitarian corridors to Mariupol,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. According to him, the Ukrainian side addressed the Holy See with such a request. ""It is too early to tell, but we are waiting for him. We are waiting because he has a mission - a mission from God. He is trusted by a large number of people, I think this is important,"" said the President. The Head of State stressed that Ukraine is grateful to the Holy See and personally to Pope Francis for his support - during speeches and prayers at various events, he supports Ukraine and condemns Russian aggression. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also recalled his personal meeting with His Holiness during an audience in the Holy See when they discussed the story of the Ukrainian military Vitaliy Markiv. ""And he helped as much as he could. And we returned our military. Because we have to fight for every person. At least these are my rules of life,"" the President of Ukraine summed up."
Everyone who gave criminal orders to kill civilians of Ukraine will get a fair punishment - President,2022-04-23T22:19:00Z,"Everyone who gave criminal orders to kill civilians during the Russian military invasion of Ukraine will face the court and get a fair punishment, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is convinced. ""I believe that everyone will definitely face the tribunal, the court. Everyone who gave these shameful orders to kill people, children - everyone. That's for sure, I'm sure of it, I believe in it,"" the President said during a press conference for international and Ukrainian media. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, criminal cases in international courts usually take a long time, several years, but Ukraine will wait for a fair verdict. ""We will wait. And if people like me don't see it, our children will. Believe me. I am sure that there will be the last nail in the policy of this state,"" the President said. He stressed that Ukrainians are interested not in the name of the tribunal that will convict the criminals, but in the outcome of this process. ""Whether it is The Hague, Ukraine, other processes... It's not about the name, it's about the number of years and the number of people. It’s about how many people will be sentenced for a large number of years of imprisonment,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The President emphasized that the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine is working with the investigative bodies of partner countries to organize such a trial. ""We believe there will be an international tribunal. We believe there will be a result of it,"" the President summed up."
Ukraine has become a state that knows that it needs to defend its land - Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-04-23T21:52:00Z,"From the first days of the war, Ukrainians have shown that they are a nation, which is ready to defend itself. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a press conference for international and Ukrainian media in Kyiv. Answering to the question whether Ukraine and its citizens are ready to live in conditions of a lasting war or constant readiness to respond to possible threats, he said: ""We will be such a state. Besides, I want to tell you that we have become such a state, we are already such a state"". At the same time, Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that this does not mean that Ukrainians will be a militant nation. ""I believe that, on the contrary, when we win, we will be a state with the most powerful army, the most experienced. The most experienced people in terms of defense. As for security guarantees, I believe that we will become one of the strongest states in Europe. Not because we are special, but because we have no other choice. These are the realities in which we live. These are the realities with which we are neighbors,"" the President stressed. The Head of State noted that Ukrainians found themselves in conditions when they did not have time to think about whether they were ready to defend themselves or not. From the first days of the war, our citizens simply stood up for their homeland. ""We have no other choice,"" he added. The President also stressed that due to the unity of the Ukrainian people, Russia's rhetoric of ultimatums began to change. ""It is due to our united people and our united state, which has demonstrated this since the first days of the war. And after a few days of the war, we saw that from the ultimatum in the messages, in the rhetoric of the Russian Federation, certain points disappeared,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy summed up."
Ukraine will return the ambassador to Georgia as soon as it feels the support of the Georgian authorities - President,2022-04-23T21:41:00Z,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that the Georgian people are fraternal for Ukrainians, but the return of the Ukrainian ambassador to Georgia is possible after the Georgian authorities support Ukraine. The Head of State said this during a press conference for international and Ukrainian media in Kyiv. ""I will say frankly: we are truly fraternal nations, but I do not understand the position of the leaders of your state. That's why I perceive it bitterly… I don't understand why sanctions are not imposed. I have heard the message ""we must protect our economy"". What economy? They (Russians - ed.) have already taken part of the territory of Georgia, almost reached Tbilisi,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. At the same time, according to him, the Georgian people are one of the nations that are really close to Ukrainians. The President noted that Georgia is a neighbor of Ukraine, and the Georgian people have supported Ukrainians starting from the first revolution and ending with the current war by providing volunteer and humanitarian assistance. In addition, Georgians are fighting on the side of Ukraine and expressed their support on the streets of Tbilisi. ""We have a war with Russia, and we definitely do not want conflicts with Georgia. I am sure we will never have conflicts... We will definitely return the ambassador to friendly Georgia as soon as we feel the support of Ukraine from your government,"" the President said."
Ukraine is ready to hold negotiations with Russia to save the lives of millions of people - President,2022-04-23T21:30:00Z,"Ukraine is ready to negotiate with the Russian Federation to end the war, as a diplomatic path will save the lives of millions of people. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a press conference for international and Ukrainian media in Kyiv. The Head of State stressed that from the very beginning of Russia's aggression, he insisted on holding direct talks with Russia, as any format of dialogue through mediators is ineffective. ""I want to stop the war, to end it. There is a diplomatic path, there is a military path. So any mentally healthy person always chooses the diplomatic path, because he or she knows: even if it is difficult, it can prevent the loss of thousands, tens of thousands, and with such neighbors - hundreds of thousands and maybe even millions of lives. There may be losses of millions of people. We don't want that, and any leader, whether he wants it personally or not, has no right to cancel the diplomatic path,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy is convinced. The President noted that today Ukraine's international partners, including the European Union, the United States and Canada, saw Russia's reluctance to hold peace talks. ""Today the trust of our partners in us is at the highest level. And there is simply no trust in Russia. Today these are antonyms - ""Russia"" and ""trust"",” the Head of State noted. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that Ukrainians have shown their fearlessness in the fight against the aggressor, so he is not afraid to negotiate with Russia. ""The leader has no right to be afraid when it comes to our state and our independence,"" the President said. At the same time, Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that if our people in Mariupol are killed, if a pseudo-referendum on pseudo-republics is announced in the temporarily occupied territories in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, Ukraine will withdraw from the negotiation process. ""I believe that this (holding a pseudo-referendum - ed.) will not benefit the diplomatic settlement of this situation. This will definitely hinder the end of the war through diplomacy. This is definitely the wrong move by Russia. This means that everything that happened before, all those meetings of diplomatic groups - it's all fiction and political theater,"" said the President. The President also called on the citizens of Ukraine in the temporarily occupied territories of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions not to help the occupiers."
"The key to successfully resisting Russian aggression is the heroism of the Ukrainian army and effective sanctions, which are being worked on by an international group of experts - Andriy Yermak",2022-04-23T18:22:00Z,"Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak notes that the heroic resistance of the Armed Forces and Ukrainian society, as well as strong and effective international sanctions, which the ""sanctions"" group of experts is working on, are important for ending Russia's aggressive war against Ukraine. This is stated in his op-ed for NV. ""Russia's blitzkrieg against Ukraine has failed. The heroic efforts of our Armed Forces and society thwarted the Kremlin's plans. Numerous aggravations on the frontline await us. Russian troops will keep trying to advance deep into Ukraine. However, the turning point has taken place, and now it is quite obvious that this war will no longer follow the Kremlin's plan,"" Andriy Yermak stressed. The Head of the Office of the President noted that Ukraine is receiving more and more military-technical, humanitarian and financial assistance. ""Our troops receive effective weapons, and their range is steadily growing, and by joint efforts the issue of lend-lease is moving from the abstract-theoretical to the practical plane,"" he wrote. Also, according to Andriy Yermak, thanks to the efforts of the Ukrainian authorities and foreign partners, the banking system is functioning stably. Utilities operate in the territories free from the occupiers, and the food situation is under control. The Head of the Office of the President noted that the key to successfully resisting Russian aggression is not only the resilience, valor and motivation of Ukrainians and professional command, but also the second frontline - international sanctions. Due to the long-term effect, they should make it difficult for Moscow to pursue an aggressive policy in the future. This is one of the elements of guaranteeing our security, at least until the legally binding mechanisms of the new security architecture start working. He explained the need to force Russia to focus on overcoming its internal problems. At the same time, we must not forget about the pressure on Russian oligarchs who must also be punished for supporting and financing the aggression. That is why President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy a few weeks ago initiated the creation of a ""sanctions"" international group of experts, which is working to assess the effectiveness of sanctions, find ways to optimize them and increase efficiency. The group chaired by the Head of the Office of the President and the well-known American diplomat Michael McFaul has already presented an Action Plan to strengthen sanctions. In particular, Ukraine submitted to the European Energy Community a proposal to impose a full oil and gas embargo on Russia. This item in the Plan proposed by experts is number one, because, according to the results of three quarters of last year, energy accounted for 34.5% of Russian budget revenues. The Plan also offers to include Russia in the FATF blacklist along with Iran and the DPRK, impose comprehensive sanctions against Russian and Belarusian banking institutions, trade restrictions on their goods, and expand transport and insurance-related restrictions. Another line of pressure is recognizing Russia and Belarus as states - sponsors of terrorism, and the Russian army and political parties as terrorist organizations. Andriy Yermak also noted the importance of introducing a mechanism of secondary sanctions against those individuals and companies who try to make money by providing services to circumvent primary sanctions."
Andrii Sybiha discussed with the leadership of the Crimea Platform the situation in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine,2022-04-23T12:41:00Z,"Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andrii Sybiha met with Head of the Crimea Platform Office, Permanent Representative of the President to the Autonomous Republic of Crimea Anton Korynevych, his deputies Tamila Tasheva, Dariya Svyrydova and Head of the Crimea Platform Support Service at the Presidential Representation Office in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea Mariya Tomak. The interlocutors discussed the active opposition of Ukrainian citizens to the illegal actions of the invaders in the temporarily occupied territories. ""Undoubtedly, increasing sanctions against Russia is extremely important to stop the criminal machine of the aggressor country. That is why we continue to work in this direction,"" Andrii Sybiha said. An algorithm for supporting citizens living in the temporarily occupied Crimea and in the occupied territories of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions was also considered. ""Today, our citizens who do not want to carry out criminal orders to destroy the Ukrainian state and who are under total pressure from the occupiers and their collaborators need our protection as never before! We will work on this,"" said the Deputy Head of the President's Office."
Armed Forces of Ukraine are the foundation on which the fortress of our national unity should stand - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-04-22T22:53:00Z,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! The 58th day of our defense is coming to an end. It ends on Good Friday, one of the most sorrowful days of the year for Christians. The day when death seems to have won. But... We hope for a resurrection. We believe in the victory of life over death. And we pray that death loses. This year, during the full-scale war, Russia's war against our state, these words have a special meaning for us. Russia brought death to Ukraine. After eight years of brutal war in Donbas, Russia wanted to destroy our state completely. Literally deprive Ukrainians of the right to life. But no matter how fierce the battles are, there is no chance for death to defeat life. Everyone knows that. Every Christian knows that. This is a basic element of our culture. Perhaps this does not exist in modern Russian culture anymore. Because in order to do everything they did to Ukrainians in our cities... you have to kill a human inside you. Because a human of any faith simply cannot do that. But for our culture, it all matters. And it will matter. And life will surely defeat death. I am grateful to our British friends for the important symbolic decision announced today to return the embassy to Kyiv. The United Kingdom became the twenty-first country to return a diplomatic mission to our capital. And this shows that we are not the only ones who believe in the victory of life over death. Today, with reference to the Russian military, the news was spread that their task now is allegedly to establish control over the south of Ukraine and reach the Moldovan border. And allegedly there, in Moldova, the rights of Russian-speakers are violated. Although, to be honest, the territory in which Russia should take care of the rights of Russian-speakers is Russia itself. Where there is no freedom of speech, no freedom of choice. Where there is simply no right to dissent. Where poverty thrives and where human life is worthless. To the extent that they come to us, go to war to steal at least something that resembles a normal life. You know they used to talk about their biggest dream: to see Paris and die. And their behavior is now just shocking. Because their dream now is to steal the toilet and die. Well, this only confirms what I have said many times: the Russian invasion of Ukraine was intended only as a beginning, then they want to capture other countries. Of course, we will defend ourselves as long as necessary to break this ambition of the Russian Federation. But all nations that, like us, believe in the victory of life over death must fight with us. They have to help us, because we are the first on this path. And who is next? If anyone who can become next wants to stay neutral today so as not to lose anything, this is the riskiest bet. Because you will lose everything. The Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to deter attacks by Russian invaders in the east and south of our country. The Izyum direction, Donbas, Pryazovia, Mariupol, Kherson region are the places where the fate of this war and the future of our state is being decided. In Slovyansk, Kramatorsk, in the Donetsk region in general, in Popasna and in the Luhansk region in general, in Kharkiv, in the surrounding areas, the occupiers are trying to achieve a primitive goal - to kill as much as possible and destroy everything they see. And I am grateful to each of our defenders who are bravely holding on, teaching the Russian army the idea that Russia's chances in this war may be less than Ukraine's. As every morning, as every day, as every evening, we have paid maximum attention today to provide our military with all the necessary weapons. This is the number one task for our state. And I am grateful to all our partners who finally heard us. Who provide us with exactly what we asked for. Because we know for sure that with these weapons we will be able to save the lives of thousands of people. And we will be able to show the occupiers that the day when they will be forced to leave Ukraine is approaching. The return to normal life in the territories liberated from the occupiers continues. If at the beginning of this week demining took place in 70 settlements, today 184 settlements have been demined. Of course, much remains to be done. But the pace, I think, is pretty good. Humanitarian headquarters are already operating in more than 500 de-occupied settlements. Almost 100 settlements are added daily, to which we return medical and educational services, the work of social protection bodies, financial institutions. We are restoring transport connections at a fairly fast pace. Plus 96 settlements today, where the transport connection was returned. Plus 183 settlements where gas stations have resumed work. Plus 90 settlements where electricity was restored. We return water supply, gas supply, mobile connection. The return of Ukraine to cities and communities means the return of life in the full sense of these words. I believe that such a return will take place in the south of our country and in the east of Ukraine. In all areas where degradation, destruction and death have been brought under the Russian flag. But it depends on how united we all will be in countering the Russian invasion. I emphasize once again that everyone should oppose the occupation at every opportunity. Ignore the occupiers. Do not cooperate with them. Don't help them. Neutralize collaborators. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are performing their tasks brilliantly. Intelligence, the National Guard, territorial defense, police, border guards - all of them work one hundred percent for the victory. But every citizen must also work for the victory - in what he does and where he is. If you are abroad - support Ukraine. If you are engaged in ordinary economic activities, do your best for the benefit of Ukraine as much as possible. If you found yourself in a temporarily occupied territory - try to cause the occupiers as much trouble as possible. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are our foundation. But a fortress of our national unity must always stand on this foundation. Unity of all Ukrainians who fight for life and against death. Against the Russian invasion. Traditionally, in the evening I signed a decree awarding our heroes. 48 defenders of Ukraine were awarded state awards. For courage in battles, for exemplary military service. Eternal glory to all who defend the state! Eternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
Russia's attempt at a new annexation will lead to powerful new sanctions that will make it as poor as it was during the 1917 civil war - address by the President of Ukraine,2022-04-22T00:26:00Z,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! Today was a very meaningful foreign policy day for Ukraine. First, the Prime Ministers of Spain and Denmark, two countries that have consistently supported Ukraine, have arrived in Kyiv. Thank you. The two leaders whose presence in Kyiv encourages other leaders of the democratic world to think about visits to Ukraine, about new gestures of support for our state, about concrete decisions that we need to win. I thanked them for helping our defense. For sanctions pressure on Russia. I called on Spain, Denmark and all other European democracies to further strengthen sanctions for this war. To finally impose an oil embargo, to disconnect the entire banking system of Russia from the global financial system. And to help us bring to justice all those guilty of war crimes against Ukrainians. The Prime Minister of Denmark stated readiness to support the program of post-war reconstruction of Ukraine, in particular the reconstruction and development of Mykolaiv and the shipbuilding industry of Ukraine. Let me remind you that this is the direction of reconstruction I proposed when addressing the Parliament and the people of Denmark in March. And today I addressed the Parliament and the people of Portugal. This was the 26th address to the parliaments of our partner states. I can say that each of these speeches really gives us additional support. Brings the decision to provide assistance to Ukraine, including defensive one, closer. And most importantly, each of these addresses helps establish a direct emotional connection between what we are experiencing in Ukraine and what the political class is experiencing in the partner countries. I also addressed the participants of the special spring session of the World Bank today. This is one of the most important events for the heads of international financial institutions and finance ministers of leading states. We are accumulating financial support for Ukraine. The United States has announced a new package of support for our state. We are grateful for that. This package contains very powerful defense tools for our military. In particular, it is artillery, shells, drones. This is what we expected. I am grateful to the partners for their help and call for further acceleration of the supply of weapons to Ukraine so that we can bring peace closer. In the south and east of our country, the occupiers continue to do everything to have a reason to talk about at least some victories. They are accumulating forces, driving new battalion tactical groups to our land. They are even trying to start the so-called mobilization in the occupied regions of Ukraine. None of these steps will help Russia in the war against our state. They can only delay the inevitable - the time when the invaders will have to leave our territory. In particular Mariupol. A city that continues to resist Russia. Despite everything the occupiers say. I urge the residents of the southern regions of Ukraine - Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions - to be very careful about what information you provide to the invaders. And if they ask you to fill out some questionnaires, leave your passport data somewhere, you should know - this is not to help you. Not just to carry out a ""census"" of people who live in a certain area, as they say. No. And not to give you any humanitarian aid. This is aimed to falsify the so-called referendum on your land, if an order comes from Moscow to stage such a show. And this is the reality. Be careful. I want to say straight away: any ""Kherson People's Republics"" are not going to fly. If someone wants a new annexation, it can only lead to new powerful sanctions strikes on Russia. You will make your country as poor as Russia hasn't been since the 1917 civil war. So it is better to seek peace now. Unfortunately, Russia rejected the proposal to establish an Easter truce. This shows very well how the leaders of this state actually treat the Christian faith, one of the most joyful and important holidays. But we keep our hope. Hope for peace, hope that life will overcome death. Tomorrow is Good Friday for Eastern Christians. The most sorrowful day of the year. A day when everything you can do in life will weigh less than prayer. Except for one... defending the Homeland, defending brothers-in-arms in battle. A few minutes ago, before delivering this address, I signed another decree on awarding our heroes, our military. 202 defenders of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 194 servicemen of the Armed Forces and 8 servicemen of the State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine. I am grateful to everyone who defends the state! Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
Address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the World Bank ministerial roundtable in support of Ukraine,2022-04-22T00:05:00Z,"Dear Mr. President David Malpass! Dear Mrs. Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva! Dear ladies and gentlemen, ministers! Greetings to all present at this historic World Bank session and thank you for the opportunity to address you today. This Sunday I spoke with Mrs. Kristalina Georgieva and heard very important words from her. Words about our state - about Ukraine. We talked with her in particular about life in our city of Kharkiv. It is the largest city in the east of Ukraine. Russian troops have been shelling and bombing it for weeks. In those parts of the city where Russian weapons reach, more than a thousand houses have already been destroyed. Russian artillery, Russian missiles, Russian air bombs do not choose who to kill and which buildings to blow up and burn. It is equally dangerous both in the center of Kharkiv and on the outskirts. You can die from Russian shelling everywhere. But you need to know the people of Kharkiv. You need to know our people... Even during the war, during such shelling, Kharkiv remains a fully functioning city. Mrs. Kristalina especially noted that in Kharkiv, despite everything, flowers are planted, trees are cultivated, the streets are cleaned now, and the city is generally tidy. That's what our Kharkiv is like. That’s what our people are like. That’s what our Ukraine is like. We managed to liberate from the occupiers the cities and communities of three northern regions of Ukraine - Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy. We immediately do everything to restore normal life there. Russian troops have destroyed or damaged tens of thousands of houses in these regions. Almost all social facilities, most of the economically important enterprises of Ukraine have been burned or need to be repaired. Thousands of people were killed. We restore electricity, communications, we restore water supply. We restore traffic, set up temporary bridges across rivers instead of destroyed ones. We return social and administrative services. We carry out demining. Several thousand explosive devices are neutralized daily. These are mines, tripwire mines and shells left over from the Russian military. Imagine, they mined even ordinary people's homes. Home appliances that they failed to steal and take away. Cars. Basements. They even mined agricultural fields... But even in such conditions, our people return home. Ukrainians are already trying to do everything to restore normal life. Because that's who we are, Ukrainians. In the east of our state, in Donbas, in the south the situation is even worse. And right now active hostilities are still going on there. Russia is still trying to develop a new brutal offensive there... I will cite only one figure now so that you can understand the scale of Ukraine's ordeal, our people's ordeal. Due to the bombing and shelling by Russian troops in Ukraine, 1,141 educational institutions were destroyed or damaged. Schools, kindergartens, universities. All over our country! Not every country in the world has as many educational institutions as destroyed by Russian troops in Ukraine. And if so many educational institutions were destroyed, you can imagine how much else was destroyed. Hospitals, infrastructure, businesses and ordinary houses. The Russian invasion completely destroyed normal economic relations. The first loss analysis alone yielded approximately $ 550 billion in losses. Russia has blocked our ports in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. This has significantly reduced Ukrainian exports, including agricultural products. Due to the shortage of Ukrainian food on the world market, the beginning of the crisis is already being felt. A recent report by the UN World Food Program stated that rising food prices this year would lead to starvation of about 47 million people in 81 countries. Without Ukrainian wheat, corn, vegetable oil and other commodities, this will result not only in physical food shortages in many countries in Africa and Asia, but also in political instability and possibly a new migration crisis. People will look for the culprits of this crisis, in particular, taking to the squares in their countries, in their cities. People will look for ways to escape. Of course, we do our best to export our products. We launched a sowing campaign this year - as much as possible. But no one in the world can be sure that food security can be guaranteed as long as this war continues - Russia's war on our land. Stopping the war now and liberating our territory from Russian invaders is the only reliable way to stop the food crisis. The Russian troops are deliberately destroying all facilities in our country that could provide an economic basis for life. Railway stations, food warehouses, bakery plants, oil terminals, etc... As of now, given the economic downturn and broken economic ties, we need up to $ 7 billion in financial support each month. Ukraine will need hundreds of billions of dollars to recover from this war. I'm sure each of you has these calculations, I'm sure of it. We must also honestly say that Russia is accompanying this war against us with aggressive measures on world markets. They specifically create such conditions that there is instability not only in the food market, but also in the fuel market and in the raw materials markets in general. Russia has provoked rising energy prices in Europe and more broadly in the democratic world. With sufficient export potential, they have constantly held back gas, in particular, to create painful price conditions for European consumers. So that people put pressure on their governments in the middle of the state for the sake of Russia's political interests. This and many other similar examples show that Russia can no longer be considered a normal and reliable supplier of energy resources, a normal and reliable trading partner. Together we are able to implement solutions that will not only stop the aggressive intentions of the Russian Federation, not only support Ukraine in this war, but also inevitably show all the potential aggressors of the world that creating problems for other states, for other nations means creating problems for themselves. Because if we do not do this, millions and millions of people in the world will repeatedly suffer from the aggressive actions of individual states. So, what steps are needed now? The first is immediate support for Ukraine, so that the Russian leadership knows that the war will not allow them to realize any of their aggressive goals. I am sure that our Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance, who are present at this meeting, will talk about the details of such financial support. We must do everything to ensure that Ukraine and Ukrainians have everything they need to live despite the war. In Kharkiv, which I mentioned at the beginning of this speech, and in all other cities and communities of Ukraine. Everywhere. Second, Russia must be immediately excluded from all international financial institutions. The IMF, the World Bank and others are definitely not the place for a state that is trying to ruin the lives of its neighbors. Third, we need a special tax for the war. Russia, and after it any other aggressor, must pay for violating global stability. Such a tax for the war should be imposed on all, without exception, trade transactions with Russia as a state or with Russian companies. On all export-import transactions, all financial transactions that have not yet been blocked. Funds from the war tax should be used to help Ukraine rebuild everything that Russia destroyed in the war. Or, if this tax is applied to another aggressor, the funds should be directed to the victim of that war. The world needs an effective tool to respond to the destructive actions of those who do not want to maintain common security and work for the common good of all in the world. I am convinced that a special tax for the war can become such a tool. Fourth, every country in the world needs to prepare now for the possible complete severance of any relations with Russia. No one should depend on the political mood of the leadership of this state. If the world is ready to isolate Russia completely, the Russian leadership will have a motive to avoid any war. And fifth, significant assets of the Russian state and representatives of the Russian elite have already been blocked. However, these are not all their assets that we are aware of. This blocking work must be continued. And not just as an end in itself. Russia's blocked funds must be used both to rebuild Ukraine after the war and to compensate for the damage that Russia has caused to other nations with its destructive behavior. If because of the war unleashed by Russia famine starts in certain regions, or if some countries are substantially affected by inflation, blocked Russian assets could be used to pay for aid and compensation. We must use all our strength to make Russia feel punishment for this war. And feel how great the need to restore peace is - including for Russia itself. So by helping us, you can help yourself as well. Stabilize the financial situation in our region and in the world in general. Ensure security in key markets, starting with food. With your financial support and decisions, we will quickly rebuild our state. And this means not only new opportunities for business from different countries, not only new opportunities for economic growth, but also concrete evidence that global financial institutions are able to work in the interests of ordinary people, in the interests of humanity as a whole. I want one of the next such meetings to take place in Ukraine. In one of our cities - maybe in Kharkiv - with your support. Thank you very much for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!"
Andriy Yermak: Sanctions against Russia should be such as to force it to end this terrible war,2022-04-21T23:18:00Z,"The main purpose of sanctions against Russia and new proposals to strengthen them is to force the aggressor to end this terrible war against Ukraine. This was stated by Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak during the presentation of the Action Plan to strengthen sanctions against the Russian Federation (see the text here), which was developed by the Yermak-McFaul international expert group. ""As the war continues, Russia continues to kill Ukrainians and destroy our cities, and it is clear that these sanctions are not enough. We need to stop all the mechanisms that feed this military machine,"" he said. The Head of the President's Office reminded that a few weeks ago President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy had taken the initiative to assess the effectiveness of sanctions against Russia and find ways to further strengthen them. Andriy Yermak proposed to create an expert group of the strongest international and Ukrainian specialists, who have worked on this task for three weeks. He said that the proposed document contains ten steps to increase sanctions pressure on Russia in the order of priority. First of all, it is a complete embargo on Russian gas and oil, the inflow of money paid for oil and gas into escrow accounts, i.e. these funds will not go to Russia and will not be used to finance this war. In the financial sphere, we are talking about total, i.e. with the freezing of assets, sanctions against all banking institutions in Russia and Belarus. At the same time, the entire democratic world must tighten trade restrictions on Russian goods. ""Another important sanctions factor is the recognition of Russia and Belarus as states - sponsors of terrorism, and the Russian army and political parties as terrorist organizations. It is also proposed to include Russia in the FATF blacklist,"" said Andriy Yermak. According to him, it is planned to expand personal sanctions against Russian officials and their families, leading members of political parties, and the management of state corporations. Sanctions against Kremlin propagandists need to be stepped up. In particular, the Head of the President's Office stressed the importance of increasing the transparency of financial and trade operations aimed at impeding trade and investment in Russia, while deepening appropriate coordination between allies and partners. Another important point is the introduction of secondary sanctions against individuals and legal entities that will provide services to Russia and Belarus to circumvent restrictive measures. Andriy Yermak noted that it is necessary to review the operations allowed now, otherwise the desired effect will not be achieved. Director of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies (FSI), Former US National Security Adviser Michael McFaul said that many steps regarding sanctions remain unfulfilled. ""We have identified very realistic and effective steps that can be taken by governments. For example, ideas such as the introduction of new tariffs for Russian products or measures regarding escrow accounts,"" he said. Michael McFaul is convinced that Russia should be recognized as a state - sponsor of terrorism, because its current actions in Ukraine are much more in line with the definition of terrorism than the actions of countries that already have such a status. Also, according to him, there are hundreds of individuals and legal entities against which sanctions should be applied. The former adviser to the President of the United States said that the experts intend to continue to work actively on the issue of secondary sanctions. Andriy Yermak thanked all the experts who took part in the preparation of the Action Plan to strengthen sanctions against Russia. ""This document will be the foundation for further work of the Government of Ukraine to increase sanctions pressure on the Russian Federation. And we invite our partners to take this list as a basis for further steps in this direction. Leaders of many countries are waiting for this document,"" he said."
"Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Assembly of the Republic, Parliament of Portugal",2022-04-21T20:50:00Z,"Dear Mr. President of the Assembly! Dear Mr. President! Dear Mr. Prime Minister! Dear ladies and gentlemen, deputies! The people of Portugal! I am grateful for the opportunity to address you at such a time, the darkest time for our state. Yesterday, in the town of Borodyanka near our capital, two more graves of civilians killed by the Russian occupiers were found. In one of these graves there are the bodies of two 35-year-old men and a 15-year-old girl. In the second grave there are six people: four men and two women. They were killed when Russian troops controlled Borodyanka. The bodies were buried in the middle of the town, near ordinary houses. Such burials are found in all communities now, in all the cities we liberate from the Russian occupiers. The world has already remembered the name of the Ukrainian city of Bucha, which is a 20-minute drive from Borodyanka. It remembered the horrible photos of the bodies of those killed just on the streets of Bucha. For weeks, the murdered people have laid on the road, on the sidewalks, near houses. Russian soldiers did not even try to remove these corpses. And they did not allow, by the way, local residents who remained in the city to bury them. I'm sure most of you have seen those photos. But in these photos it is far from everything the locals had to go through. The occupiers killed people even for fun and to loot their houses. People were thrown to die in the well. Tortured. Executed. Grenades were thrown into the basements where people were hiding from shelling. The Russian military killed refugees on the roads. They opened fire on cars with the word ""Children"" written on them. Hundreds of such riddled and burned cars remained on the roads... In the Kyiv region alone - and this is as of today, because not all burials have been found yet - the occupiers killed 1,126 Ukrainians. 40 of them are children. In the Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and other regions of Ukraine, where Russian troops entered, they caused the same hell as in Borodyanka or Bucha. Just one example. In the village of Yahidne in the Chernihiv region, the occupiers drove all the villagers into the basement of the school and kept them there for weeks. This is a small village school, a small basement in which about 10 people died of suffocation alone. The youngest child in the basement was 3 months old. Imagine a three month old baby! And the oldest person was 93 years old. And in total there were about 400 people in the basement! More than three weeks. Day and night they were forbidden to go out of the basement even to the toilet. And when people asked for clothes for children, the occupiers demanded that they sing the Russian national anthem. That's how the Russian military had fun. This is the impunity they felt. This is what is happening in Ukraine now. In 2022. We are fighting against Russian troops not just for our state. Not just for independence. But literally for the survival of our people. So that Ukrainians are not executed. So that Ukrainians are not tortured. So that Ukrainians are not raped. And so that Ukrainians are not deported to Russia. The Russian occupiers have already deported at least 500,000 our citizens from the territory they have occupied. It's like your two cities of Porto. Just imagine that. There were people - and now they are gone. 500 thousand people! This is deportation. This is what the worst totalitarian regimes of the past did. The deported Ukrainians are deprived of means of communication, everything is taken away from them, even documents. They are distributed to the remote regions of Russia. The occupiers set up special filtration camps to distribute people. Some of those who get there are simply killed. Girls are raped. Imagine what it's like when a girl escapes from such a Russian filtration camp, and when asked how she did it, she says Russian soldiers simply didn't like her. Because if they had liked her, she would have been raped and then killed, like many others. During the 57 days of the full-scale war, we liberated about a thousand settlements of Ukraine, which were captured by Russia, by the invaders. However, the number of occupied cities and communities is much bigger. Russian troops do not stop shelling and bombing our cities. They are destroying residential areas, any civilian infrastructure that allows cities to maintain normal life. Food warehouses, schools, universities, hospitals, even churches are being blown up. More than 10 million Ukrainians have been forced to flee their homes due to hostilities. Imagine this number. It's as if the whole of Portugal was forced to flee! I do not want to call these 10 million Ukrainians refugees. We use the term ""displaced persons"" to refer to them, these people. We hope that they will all be able to return home when it is safe. But when will it be? And what will be left of their house? Today, the Russian Defense Minister reported to the Russian leader on the hostilities against our city of Mariupol. You have all heard about Mariupol. Before the war, it was a city comparable in size to Lisbon. It was a half-million seaside city. Now it is completely destroyed. There is not a single undamaged building in Mariupol. Literally scorched city. For more than a month, the Russian troops have kept Mariupol under siege. Even humanitarian goods were not allowed. Hundreds of thousands of civilians were there without food, without water, without medicine. Under constant shelling, under constant bombing. Russian troops used aircraft to destroy even shelters and they knew for sure that there was no one there but civilians. Some Mariupol residents managed to escape, and for most of them nothing and no one was left at all. There aren't even photos of their pre-war life - everything was burned. Tens of thousands of Ukrainians died in the city during Russia's hostilities against Mariupol. We do not even know the exact number of the dead. And we may not find it out. Because Russian troops brought to the city so-called mobile crematoria - special machines for the destruction of human bodies. The occupiers drew conclusions from how the world reacted to the massacre in Bucha. And now the Russians are trying to hide the traces of war crimes. Ladies and Gentlemen! Portuguese people! When we turn to the nations of the free world for help, we say simple and clear things. We need weapons to protect ourselves from the brutal Russian invasion, which brought to our people as much evil as the Nazi invasion did 80 years ago. Leopard tanks, armored personnel carriers, Harpoon anti-ship missiles - you have them and you can help protect the freedom and civilization of Europe with them. Therefore, I appeal to your state to provide us with this assistance. We need increased pressure of sanctions on Russia, because only sanctions can force Russia to seek peace and deprive the Russian military machine of resources. We need the principled stance of European companies, so that all of them leave the Russian market, because their taxes, their excise taxes, which they pay to the Russian budget, support this evil. Why did Russia start the war? The capture of Ukraine is its first step in gaining control of Eastern Europe to destroy democracy in our region. Ukraine has been and remains the mainstay of democratic processes in our region. The two revolutions of 2004 and 2014, which stopped the dictatorship in Ukraine, in fact defended democracy not only for our nation, but also for all the nations of our region who want to freely choose the future, without any coercion - internal and external. And your people who will soon celebrate the anniversary of the Carnation Revolution, which freed you from the dictatorship, clearly understand our feelings. Exactly understands the feelings of all other nations of our region who seek freedom. What does Russia bring to Ukraine? Death and dictatorship. And after Ukraine it will try to bring all this to Moldova, Poland, Georgia, the Baltic states, Kazakhstan and all other countries it can reach. Russia can be stopped. Mass killings, deportation and dictatorship can be stopped. Now, in Ukraine. I am grateful to your government and to all the Portuguese people for the assistance to Ukraine you have already provided. For supporting sanctions against Russia. And it is important now, when the European Union is preparing the sixth package of sanctions, that you show your leadership and defend the need for an oil embargo against Russia at the European level. It is also important that you, along with other EU countries, insist on a complete restriction of the Russian banking system. We need to close all EU ports, all Portuguese ports for Russian ships. In particular, for those that they are trying to hide under other countries’ flags. I am grateful to you for supporting our people, Ukrainian displaced persons. The Ukrainian and Portuguese people know each other well. They understand each other well. And it is important that you use your opportunities, both in Europe and in other macro-regions of the world, to protect the freedom and right to life of our people. You can tell the truth about this Russian invasion, about this war against the Ukrainian people, both in South America and in Africa. I ask you to fight Russian propaganda and Russian corrupt influence in the countries that are close to you. And I believe that the people of Portugal, and with them the Portuguese politicians, will support our state in its fundamental desire to be with you in the European Union. The free must support the free. The decent must support the decent. The conscientious must support the conscientious. And I believe that you will not betray us or yourself. Because Ukraine is already on its way to the European Union under an accelerated procedure. We hope that in the near future we will be able to obtain the status of a candidate for membership in the European Union. And when the decision is considered, I ask you to support full membership for Ukraine. Because you on the western edge of Europe and we on the eastern edge of Europe have the same values, the same view of what life should be like on our continent. Freedom, human rights, the rule of law, equality for every man, for every woman and the opportunity to live freely and without any dictatorship, so that everyone always has the time for happiness and for saudade. Thank you, Portugal! Glory to Ukraine!"
‘Leave no Child Alone’ campaign to improve protection for children without parental care is being launched with the support of the Office of the President of Ukraine,2022-04-21T19:07:00Z,"The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in Ukraine together with the Office of the President, Adviser - President's Commissioner for Children's Rights and Children's Rehabilitation, and the Ministry of Social Policy are launching a nationwide information campaign ""Leave no Child Alone: Instructions for Care"" on April 21. The goal of the campaign is to draw public attention to the violation of children's rights during the war and to provide comprehensive information on how to solve these problems. In particular, it concerns the rights of children left without parental care due to the war and in need of care and a temporary home. The campaign will provide information on how to properly support and protect the rights of children left without parental care, as well as provide instructions on the temporary shelter for children in the family. “Today, the number of children deprived of parental care and being at risk is growing. First, these are children from regions where active hostilities and bombing of residential areas are taking place. The chat bot @dytyna_ne_sama_bot (“Child not alone”) is a tool which can help people give a temporary shelter in their family to a child who got lost or is left without parental care,” said Maryna Lazebna, Minister of Social Policy in Ukraine.  The campaign will scale-up access to the Telegram chatbot ‘@dytyna_ne_sama_bot' (Leave no Child Alone), which provides opportunities for Ukrainian families and international organizations to submit an application to children’s services to provide temporary care for children in need. Over 15,000 Ukrainian families and more than 500 organizations from abroad have already submitted their applications through the chatbot. The chatbot also contains instructions for those who have lost or found a child. ""Even before the war, nearly 17,000 children in Ukraine were up for adoption. Orphans and children deprived of parental care need to grow up in a home and family environment instead of upbringing in institutional care facilities. With each bombing, the number of these children is increasing. We are planning to improve the adoption process and will digitize some of its components, which will be launched immediately after the war. Currently a large number of families are able and willing to help these children - they need additional information and latest updates on the process,"" said Dariya Herasymchuk, Advisor to the President of Ukraine on the Rights of the Child and Child Rehabilitation.  The Ministry of Social Policy will launch a new webpage with specific guidance on the protection of child rights during wartime. UNICEF is providing technical support for the content development and management of the page.  “Every child in Ukraine needs assistance, as this horrific war continues, but children without parental care are particularly at risk of exploitation and abuse,” said UNICEF Ukraine Representative Murat Sahin.  “This campaign unites all our efforts to best protect children across the country,” Sahin added.  The three-month campaign integrates digital content and outdoor advertising, as well as national and international media engagement. The campaign also features prominent Ukrainians and opinion leaders. "
"President: We really want to save the lives of our people, and this requires heavy weapons and equipment",2022-04-21T17:51:00Z,"Ukraine needs heavy weapons to protect the lives of its citizens and to counter the Russian army, which has a numerical advantage in personnel and equipment. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a meeting with media representatives following the negotiations with Prime Minister of Spain Pedro Sánchez and Prime Minister of Denmark Mette Frederiksen in Kyiv. The Head of State stressed that in negotiations with all foreign partners, the issue of providing Ukraine with heavy weapons is a priority for him. ""The issue of weaponry is the most important. Yes, we also talked about finances that can support our pensioners, about social support where partners can help us. Because the economy in times of war is not about the economy. This is about plugging holes. This is a difficult story. But without weapons there will be nothing: no economy, no pensions, no salaries. Because there will be no one to protect. So far, we are raising the issue so that there is something to protect our population with,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The President thanked the Prime Ministers of Spain and Denmark for the weapons that have already arrived and are yet to be delivered. The President stressed that the timely provision of the necessary weapons will save the lives of citizens, which is a priority for Ukraine. ""We really want to save lives, to this end we need this equipment, which is lacking,"" he said. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, there are two ways to liberate civilians and servicemen from Mariupol, which has been blocked by Russian troops: military and diplomatic. The implementation of the military way requires weapons, which are currently insufficient, and the help of our partners. People can be liberated more quickly through diplomacy, and Ukraine has offered several options, including with the participation of mediators, as well as in the format of exchanging the wounded, but Russia does not agree to this, the President said."
"Volodymyr Zelenskyy discussed with the Prime Ministers of Denmark and Spain the issues of strengthening defense capabilities, rebuilding and supporting Ukraine's integration into the EU",2022-04-21T17:24:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Spain Pedro Sánchez and Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Denmark Mette Frederiksen who are on a visit to our country. The Ukrainian President noted that the joint visit of the heads of government of European states is an important signal of solidarity and support for the Ukrainian people and the unity of Ukraine with the EU states in the fight against Russian aggression. During the meeting in Kyiv, the interlocutors discussed in detail the possibilities of strengthening Ukraine's armed response to the aggressor, rebuilding our state after winning the war and future membership in the European Union. ""We have crucial difficult days ahead, a crucial battle for our state, for our land, for the Ukrainian Donbas. We are doing everything we can so that our defenders can defend our land and protect their own lives very effectively. Ukraine's needs have been explained to our guests today. We are waiting for the prompt aid from them,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at a meeting with media representatives following talks with the Prime Ministers of Spain and Denmark. The President thanked both countries for their assistance in strengthening the capabilities of Ukraine's defense forces. Also during the talks, the parties agreed to continue to work actively to increase sanctions pressure on Russia. ""This pressure must increase until the aggression on the part of the Russian Federation is terminated. And I really want all these sanctions to be profound and really effective, so that the Russian Federation really feels it. If there is a disconnection from SWIFT, do it to all banks. Don't just raise the issue of restricting energy supplies from Russia to Europe, but specifically impose an embargo on oil and gas,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. In addition, the President of Ukraine discussed with Pedro Sánchez and Mette Frederiksen the strengthening of financial support and specific projects of the post-war reconstruction of our state, the patronage of which could be undertaken by Denmark and Spain. “So that every person from one state or another feels that he or she has made a great, historical contribution to the reconstruction of Ukraine,"" the President said. The parties paid special attention to Ukraine's movement towards membership in the European Union. ""Ukraine, we believe, deserves faster accession to the EU. We really count on your support, on the support of your teams, your people and communities. We consider ourselves equal, not better than you, but definitely equal. And we really want to be in alliance with partners and friends who are here today and who help us,"" the President stressed. For her part, Mette Frederiksen noted that Denmark has provided substantial political, financial and sanctions assistance to Ukraine from the very beginning, as well as the necessary equipment and weapons. She announced a new contribution to Ukrainian defense and security in the amount of DKK 600,000. The Prime Minister noted the importance of demining the de-occupied territories and restoring the work of utilities so that people could return to normal life as soon as possible. Mette Frederiksen said that during the current visit she visited Borodyanka in the Kyiv region and saw with her own eyes what was happening there during the Russian occupation. She expressed support for the Ukrainian people. The Prime Minister of Denmark emphasized the support of the International Criminal Court for the documentation of all crimes committed by Russia against Ukraine, as well as the support of affected families who deserve justice. ""We must ensure that all those responsible for crimes are punished,"" she added. The Prime Minister of Denmark informed that her country officially confirmed the consent to the offer put forward by Volodymyr Zelenskyy during the speech in the Danish Parliament concerning the participation in the reconstruction of Mykolaiv. ""Putin tried to divide us - to sow discord between Europe and Ukraine. He was defeated in this. What happened in the last month is undoubtedly an expression of extraordinary solidarity with Ukraine, which has in fact become part of Europe. The EU and global partners have imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia, and together we will do even more,"" said Mette Frederiksen. Pedro Sánchez also assured that Spain and its people support Ukraine in defending freedom and European democratic values, strongly condemn Russia's actions and stand against this unjust war. He stressed that Spain will fully support Ukraine on its path to EU membership. ""We support, Mr. President, your intention to join the European family. You have the right to choose your destiny and you have a very legitimate reason to do so by joining the common European home,"" said Pedro Sánchez, addressing Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He condemned the atrocities committed by the occupiers in Ukraine which cannot go unpunished. Pedro Sánchez said that Spain would assist in the investigation of crimes by sending a group of experts of various kinds, including forensic experts. ""We want Putin to bear responsibility for his crimes, for the crimes of his country. We will help Ukraine, the Ukrainian people until we achieve our goal - freedom and peace for Ukraine,"" the Spanish Prime Minister assured. Pedro Sánchez reminded that in recent weeks, Spain has provided assistance to Ukraine's medical system, military equipment and weapons. Spain has contributed € 120 million to the European Peace Fund and supported the humanitarian package with a € 31 million contribution. The funds will be directed primarily to the needs of women and children. He assured that assistance will be further provided. The Prime Minister of Spain said that a new cargo of 200 tons of ammunition and other materiel is already arriving in Ukraine. Pedro Sánchez also said that Spain aims to restore the work of its embassy in Ukraine."
Mykhailo Podolyak: The return of Ukrainians deported to Russia will be another war - a war for our citizens,2022-04-21T10:49:00Z,"Adviser to the Head of the President's Office Mykhailo Podolyak is convinced that Russia will hinder the return of Ukrainian citizens forcibly deported from the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine or places of active hostilities, so their return will be another frontline for our country after the active phase of the war. ""This is a difficult procedure that will require intermediary countries or international institutions that will allow us to bring people back. I'd like to note that this will also be a war. After the war, there will be a war to take our people back,"" Mykhailo Podolyak said during the United News TV marathon. According to him, Russia, which has a historical tradition and practice of so-called resettlement of nations in order to separate them from their homeland, will never acknowledge that people were forcibly deported or forced to do so by conditions created by Russians. ""They will not tell us objective information that, for example, of the 100,000 deported from Mariupol, Volnovakha and other regions of the Donetsk region, only 5% wanted to go to Russia, and the rest were forcibly deported there,"" said the Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President. According to Mykhailo Podolyak, the Russians will continue to try to convince the world community that this migration was voluntary. ""In terms of propaganda, the Russians will lie to the whole world that these people wanted to go from Ukraine to such a large and prosperous country, that they feel “comfortable” living in Tomsk and so on,"" he said. ""Ukrainians who lived in beautiful cities, had an opportunity to travel the world, build a career, study in good educational institutions, chose these ruined, useless and worthless cities of the Russian Federation as their place of residence?"" added the Adviser to the Head of the President's Office. Regarding the possibility of returning deported citizens of Ukraine, Mykhailo Podolyak noted that first of all it will be necessary to clarify who was deported to Russia, how and under what conditions, who agreed and who was deported by force. After that, it will be necessary to compile legally verified lists and hand them over to the Russian side. Mykhailo Podolyak is convinced that these people should be visited by mediators or representatives of international organizations who will be trustworthy so that citizens can communicate openly with them and will not be afraid to say that they want to return to their country. ""This is a whole legally sound procedure for us to take them back,"" the Adviser to the Head of the President's Office summed up. As for the prospects of agreeing on humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of civilians from the city of Mariupol, which is under constant fire from the occupiers, the Ukrainian side is in constant contact with Russia on this issue, but unfortunately Russia rejects or agrees and then does not keep the word. ""There was an attempt by a third party - Turkey, which tried to take part in taking people from Mariupol. They wanted to do it through the waters of the Sea of Azov, and offered other options. But the Russians are waging war against us not in terms of hostilities - they are waging a genocidal war. They believe that it is possible to kill and keep the corridors closed for the delivery of medicines or food. Unfortunately, they are using Syrian tactics,"" he said, adding that Russia is waging an inhumane war against civilians. However, Ukraine will continue to demand the opening of humanitarian corridors, a temporary ceasefire and the involvement of a third party as a guarantor or mediator, Mykhailo Podolyak said. ""The world watches this war live, and it is unclear what reputation the Russian Federation is counting on. What do they want in historical terms? They will be called the Nazi state of the Russian Federation in history textbooks,” said the Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine."
"The war can be finished with direct negotiations between the Presidents of Ukraine and Russia, and the positions of the Ukrainian side at these negotiations must be strong - Mykhailo Podolyak",2022-04-21T09:04:00Z,"Russia's aggressive war against Ukraine can be finished with direct negotiations between the two heads of state, and the Ukrainian side's position in these negotiations must be strong, well-thought-out and legally sound. This was stated by Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Mykhailo Podolyak during the United News TV marathon. ""This is what the team of lawyers, consultants and the negotiating group from the Ukrainian side are working on today. Accordingly, we hope that the positions of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be extremely strong in these talks,"" he said. Mykhailo Podolyak expressed conviction that the Head of the Ukrainian state will be able to convey key, fundamental things for Ukraine to the counterpart from the aggressor country during the talks. At the same time, according to the Adviser to the Head of the President's Office, we need to wait for the situation in the east of our country to develop and assess how substantive the offensive fervor shown by the Russian side will be. ""They have enough resources, enough missiles, they unfortunately continue to bomb our cities. They still have manpower and equipment that they do not mind destroying in our fields. Therefore, let's wait a while, and then we will be able to talk about the positions of the parties, first of all the President of Ukraine, at future bilateral meetings,"" Mykhailo Podolyak said. According to him, in the next week and a half it will be clear how things will develop. ""The Armed Forces of Ukraine have no choice but to gain tactical victories in the east of the country today. It is fundamentally important for us to remain free, not live in the camp,"" said Mykhailo Podolyak adding that, unfortunately, the Ukrainian servicemen are paying a high price for this - giving their lives."
Today is a historic moment when Ukraine can develop maximum speed in joining the EU - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-04-20T22:18:00Z,"Free people of the bravest country! The 56th day of our defense is coming to an end, and today we have definitely become one step closer to peace. I was glad to welcome in Kyiv a great friend of our state and all Ukrainians - President of the European Council Charles Michel. Each such visit only underscores how absurd Russia's plans to seize our state were. Three days? Five days? In how many days the occupiers planned to take control of Ukraine? 56 days - and we are meeting our guests in our capital for the sake of our national interests. I held very thorough talks with Charles Michel on many aspects of relations between Ukraine and the European Union. The main thing is, of course, to protect our state and maintain the stable functioning of all state structures and all institutions. We discussed concrete steps of the European Union to help our country. In particular, defensive, financial and sanctions. The second major topic of the talks is our movement towards European integration. This is the historic moment when we can develop maximum speed in joining the European Union. We have already proved that the Ukrainian state and public institutions are effective enough to withstand even the test of war. We are already doing as much to protect freedom on the European continent as other nations have never done. And I see from all our friends in the European Union a willingness to help our movement as much as possible. I thanked Charles for that today. The third major topic of our talks is the preparation of the necessary steps for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war. We also discussed what we can do together with the European Union to address the threats to food and energy security in Europe and around the world posed by Russia. Resuming exports of Ukrainian agricultural products and blocking Russia's ability to blackmail Europe with energy resources are top priorities for everyone on the continent. Before meeting with me, President Charles Michel visited Borodyanka, Kyiv region. He came there not alone, but together with his team. They saw with their own eyes what the occupiers had done on our land. What destruction they had caused. And a correct conclusion was made by our friends: there can be no peace without justice. We will do everything we can to bring to justice every Russian military and commander guilty of war crimes. Modern technology allows you to clarify many details. Every surname, every home address, every bank account - we will find everything. A Plan to strengthen sanctions against the Russian Federation for the war against our state was published today. This Plan was developed by a team of Ukrainian and international experts led by Andriy Yermak and Michael McFaul. When all the key areas identified in this Plan are implemented, Russia will lose the opportunity to finance the military machine. In particular, the Plan provides for restrictions on Russia's energy sector, banking sector, export-import operations, transport. The next steps should include an oil embargo and a complete restriction on oil supplies from Russia. We are also working to ensure that all - I emphasize - all Russian officials who support this shameful war receive a logical sanctions response from the democratic world. Russia must be recognized as a state - sponsor of terrorism, and the Russian Armed Forces must be recognized as a terrorist organization. The European Union is currently preparing a sixth package of sanctions. We discussed this today with Charles Michel. We are working to make it truly painful for the Russian military machine and the Russian state as a whole. I emphasize in all negotiations that sanctions are needed not as an end in themselves, but as a practical tool to motivate Russia to seek peace. It is important that the EU Delegation and the embassies of friendly countries resumed work in Kyiv. This is one of the signals needed to tell Russia that there is no alternative to peace. There is no alternative to ending the war and guaranteeing full security for Ukraine. The more diplomatic missions return to work in our capital, the stronger this important signal will be. Already 18 foreign missions are working in Kyiv in various formats. In particular, Italy, Iran, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, the Holy See, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Turkey, France, the Czech Republic, Estonia and others. The return to normal life of the liberated cities and communities of Ukraine continues. 934 settlements have already been liberated. Police resumed work in 435 settlements. Local self-government started working in 431 communities. The work of humanitarian headquarters was launched in 361 settlements. We are gradually restoring people's access to medical and educational services, to social protection bodies. We are restoring road infrastructure, electricity, gas and water supply. The biggest threats are mines and tripwire mines planted by the occupiers and shells that did not explode. It takes a lot of time, a lot of effort to neutralize them all. And I am grateful to all the specialists, all the rescuers who perform this important task. Once again, I urge our citizens returning to liberated communities to be very careful. Do not enter the territory that has not yet been inspected. Do not go into the woods yet. If you see anything resembling a mine or a tripwire mine, report it to the police and rescuers immediately. Do not delay or attempt to remove hazardous items yourself. The situation in the east and south of our country remains as severe as possible. The occupiers do not give up trying to gain at least some victory for themselves through a new large-scale offensive. At least something they can ""feed"" their propagandists with. And I am sincerely grateful to each of our defenders, to all the Armed Forces of Ukraine, to all our cities, to all our communities that are resisting the invaders. To those who hold on and with their struggle, without exaggeration, save our state. Mariupol, Avdiivka, Maryinka, Krasnohorivka, Toretsk, Velyka Novosilka, Zolote, Popasna, Izyum, Kharkiv, Hulyaipole, Mykolaiv, Vysokopillya, Snihurivka and dozens, dozens of other cities, dozens of other communities of the east, communities of the south of Ukraine, in the struggle for which the fate of our people and our freedom is being decided. We are doing more than the maximum to ensure the supply of weapons to our army. Every day, all our diplomats, all our representatives and I personally work 24/7 through all possible channels - official and unofficial - to speed up the delivery of aid. And I am very pleased to say, with cautious optimism, that our partners started to understand our needs better. Understand what exactly we need. And when exactly we need all this. Not in weeks, not in a month, but immediately. Right now, as Russia is trying to intensify its attacks. Traditionally, before delivering the address, I signed a decree awarding our defenders. 203 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 49 of them posthumously. Five of our servicemen were posthumously awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Eternal gratitude to all who stood up for our state! Glory to Ukraine!"
"Russia hasn’t yet agreed to the diplomatic path to unblock Mariupol, despite public rhetoric - Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-04-20T21:25:00Z,"Ukraine is ready to resolve the issue of unblocking Mariupol and evacuating civilians through diplomacy, but Russia has not yet shown readiness to take such a step. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a meeting with media representatives after talks with President of the European Council Charles Michel in Kyiv. ""The situation in Mariupol is deteriorating. Unfortunately, so far we cannot achieve a positive result there. Our warriors have hundreds of wounded. Protecting ordinary civilians with their backs, they lose their lives. Because, as far as I know, there are about a thousand civilians behind our guys in Mariupol, including children and women,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The Head of State stressed that Ukraine constantly offers the Russian side options for organizing humanitarian corridors. Some of them worked. ""Tens of thousands of civilians were evacuated from Mariupol thanks to this work. Unfortunately, several thousand people believed the Russian occupiers and went to the occupied parts of our state, as well as to the Russian Federation. And we do not know the fate of these thousands of peaceful people,"" he said. According to the President, there are two ways to unblock Mariupol. The first is to provide substantial assistance to the Ukrainian military with heavy weapons. The defenders of the city, who are not going to surrender to the enemy, hope for this option. But so far Ukraine does not have enough equipment to work in this direction, the President said. ""The second way is diplomatic, and so far Russia does not agree to that. No matter what public signals they come out with, saying they are open, ready to exchange. Or, as they say, ""the ball is on our court"" (Ukraine's court - ed.) - they do not know what they are playing. Or vice versa - they continue to play,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The President stated that Ukraine is ready for various formats of exchanging its people for the Russian military. ""And we are ready for the sake of our people - both military and civilian - for any format of exchange. And whether I like it or not, in the course of the remaining three years that the people have given me, I am ready to hold a dialogue with the President of Russia on the end of the war,"" said the Ukrainian President."
European partners have made a significant contribution to Ukraine's military capabilities - President,2022-04-20T20:37:00Z,"The European Union must maximize sanctions pressure on the Russian Federation and provide Ukraine with all the necessary modern weapons to help our country win the war that Russia is shamefully waging against it. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a meeting with media representatives following talks with European Council President Charles Michel in Kyiv. The President thanked the EU senior official for his personal support and this visit, which took place despite all security challenges. He noted that Charles Michel visited the village of Borodyanka in the Kyiv region and could see the atrocities of the Russian occupiers. ""We understand that Russia seeks to destroy the Ukrainian people, the Ukrainian statehood. And this is a real genocide. We see that Russia does not stop in its bloody desire to destroy Ukrainians and our state at any cost, women, children, our defenseless civilian population,"" he said. The President said that Ukraine and the EU had agreed to work closely together to investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the Russian military. ""I am convinced that by joint efforts we will be able to bring to justice all those guilty. And we will find everyone for sure, I promise you that,"" the Head of State said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also noted that the timing of arms supplies has become clearer. ""European partners have made a significant contribution to our military capabilities. I am grateful for the allocation of 1.5 billion euros within the European Peace Fund to finance the military needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,"" he said. According to the Head of State, it was agreed to use these funds as efficiently as possible so that Ukraine would receive exactly the weapons it needs now. ""Not all, but those that are a top priority for us now. Not all, but those that we do not have. These are very important nuances. Timely and what is needed,"" the President stressed. Speaking about the strengthening of sanctions against Russia, he noted that the sixth powerful sanctions package should be approved as soon as possible depriving Russia of the opportunity to finance the war. ""We are grateful for the EU's five sanctions packages. But, unfortunately, some things have not been completed by these sanctions, they need to be analyzed in more detail and implemented. It is still not enough to stop the financing of this war by the Russian Federation,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. In particular, according to him, Ukraine calls for a full energy embargo on Russia, including oil and gas imports. ""Oil must definitely be included in the sixth package. We believe that without it the package will not be powerful, it will be empty,"" the President stressed. The Head of State noted that it is also necessary to finally disconnect all Russian banks from SWIFT, including Sberbank and Gazprombank. It is necessary to block all accounts of the Russian state and companies, directing these funds to the reconstruction of Ukraine. Every Russian civil servant and their family must feel the effects of sanctions and the consequences of their personal support for the war against Ukraine. For his part, Charles Michel is convinced that Russia must be held accountable for the war crimes and atrocities it has committed in the occupied Ukrainian cities. He also spoke in favor of helping Ukraine document the crimes of the invaders to ensure justice. The President of the European Council noted that in the first days of the war the EU adopted a decision to provide military support to Ukraine, including equipment and weapons. In addition, EU member states provided assistance at the bilateral level at the request of the Ukrainian state. Charles Michel also supported increasing pressure on the Russian regime to end the war. And today, additional points of proposals for the European Council to increase sanctions pressure on Russia were discussed. ""We will do everything we can for Ukraine to win, because we want the victory of Ukraine,"" said the President of the European Council."
EU membership is a priority for the Ukrainian state and our people - Volodymyr Zelenskyy following the meeting with Charles Michel in Kyiv,2022-04-20T20:02:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with President of the European Council Charles Michel who is on a visit to our country. The Head of State stressed that Ukraine has already submitted part of the questionnaire to the European side to obtain the status of a candidate for EU membership. ""We are looking forward to the meeting, to the voting on this priority issue for our state. We expect great support from the European Union countries and personal support from President Charles Michel,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a meeting with media representatives following talks with the President of the European Council in Kyiv. For his part, Charles Michel said that a decision on granting Ukraine EU candidate status is to be announced at the end of June. He expressed confidence that our country will gain strong support for its European integration course. ""The road to the European Union is the road to your future. And every day you demonstrate that you are fully committed to democratic principles and freedoms. You are fighting not just for the future of Ukrainian children, but for the fundamental values of Europe,"" said the President of the European Council. Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked Charles Michel for establishing the Solidarity Trust Fund, which will help rebuild our state. ""We must unite efforts to restore our critical infrastructure, the infrastructure of our cities, our country, our villages, in particular, given the large number of displaced people in Ukraine due to this war,"" the President said. The President of Ukraine stressed that the work to restore the infrastructure of settlements should begin now, without waiting for the end of the war. ""People are living now, people are now using all this infrastructure, which is lacking,"" he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that the Trust Fund of Solidarity with Ukraine should become one of the main components of ensuring support for our country's economy and its post-war recovery. ""We discussed the prospects of holding a relevant donor conference to launch this fund. Complex challenges require immediate action without delay. Our joint action. After all, only together we can and will overcome everything and succeed,"" the Head of State said. The President of Ukraine also noted that our country highly appreciates the initiative to establish the Solidarity Trust Fund, which was supported by the member states of the European Union and which should unite efforts to rebuild the destroyed infrastructure. In addition, the parties discussed the technical details of mobilizing funds so that Ukraine can effectively respond to social challenges. ""We are all impressed with your leadership. By your personal example, you show the bravery of Ukrainians. We stand with you and we will do everything to support you so that Ukraine wins this war,"" said Charles Michel."
Yermak-McFaul International Expert Group presents action plan to strengthen sanctions against Russia,2022-04-20T16:14:00Z,"Created pursuant to the initiative of President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a group of Ukrainian and international experts who analyze the real impact of sanctions imposed on Russia presents an action plan to strengthen sanctions against the Russian Federation. On Wednesday, April 20, the co-chairs of the expert group - Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak and Director of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies (FSI), Former US National Security Adviser, Ambassador Michael McFaul - will present the Sanctions Action Plan to the public. The time of the presentation will be announced separately on social networks. This document contains proposals to the international democratic community on a set of further economic measures aimed at forcing the Russian leadership to end the war in Ukraine as soon as possible and maximize the price of aggression for Russia. The plan focuses on 10 key areas of sanctions policy, including: Designating Russia and Belarus as states - sponsors of terrorism, and the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation as a terrorist organization;  A complete ban on Russian energy exports; Expanding sanctions against the financial sector of Russia and Belarus; Enhancing transportation-related and insurance-related sanctions; Expanding and strengthening trade embargoes and personal sanctions. The document also emphasizes the importance of introducing secondary sanctions and synchronizing the efforts of democratic countries in sanctions policy. ""This document will be the basis for further work of our government to increase sanctions pressure on Russia. We will offer our partners this list as a basis for coordinating the implementation of sanctions. By the way, the document itself contains provisions on the synchronization of sanctions pressure from democratic countries,"" Andriy Yermak said. The Head of the President's Office thanked the expert group for its high efficiency and urged to continue the work. ""We need a quick implementation of all the proposals and a thorough assessment of their effectiveness,"" he said."
"If our partners have the weapons Ukraine needs, their duty is to help protect freedom and the lives of people - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-04-19T22:49:00Z,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! The 55th day of our defense against Russia's full-scale aggression is coming to an end. At present, virtually the entire combat-ready part of the invaders' army is concentrated on the territory of our state and in the border areas of Russia. They drove against Ukraine almost everyone and almost everything that can fight us. Therefore, in this confrontation, in this defense, before the eyes of the whole world, we are really opposing the army, which was considered the second or third in power. And the way our Armed Forces are holding on, the way our entire nation is boldly defending itself shows that the Ukrainian army has long deserved to be higher than the Russian one in global rankings. If we had access to all the weapons we need, which our partners have and which are comparable to the weapons used by the Russian Federation, we would have already ended this war. We would have already restored peace and liberated our territory from the occupiers. Because the superiority of the Ukrainian military in tactics and wisdom is quite obvious. That is why I emphasize the simple truth in literally every contact with the leaders of the democratic world, in all negotiations, in all interviews - it is unfair that Ukraine is still forced to ask for what its partners have been storing somewhere for years. If they have the weapons that Ukraine needs here, needs now, if they have the ammunition that we need here and now, it is their moral duty first of all to help protect freedom. Help save the lives of thousands of Ukrainians. If we had received what we are getting now in the first week of the war, the benefit for Ukraine and for freedom in Europe would be greater, I am sure. And if we get what some partners plan to hand over to Ukraine in the coming weeks right now, it will save the lives of thousands of people. I hope that the partners will hear this thesis and understand that every day matters. Any delay in helping Ukraine gives the occupiers an opportunity to kill more Ukrainians. The intensity of fire by Russian troops in the Kharkiv direction, in Donbas and in the Dnipropetrovsk region has increased significantly. They still consider ordinary housing infrastructure normal targets for them. In this war, the Russian army will forever inscribe itself in world history as perhaps the most barbaric and inhuman army in the world. Purposefully killing civilians, destroying residential neighborhoods, civilian infrastructure, using all kinds of weapons for this, including those prohibited by international conventions, is the signature of the Russian army. And this is vileness, which will mark the Russian state as a source of absolute evil for generations. And when a special tribunal is set up to convict all those guilty of war crimes, a Russian passport will mean only one thing in any country: unequivocal condemnation from all decent people, unequivocal unwillingness to cooperate. The situation in Mariupol remains unchanged - as severe as possible. The Russian army is blocking any efforts to organize humanitarian corridors and save our people. The occupiers are trying to carry out deportation or even mobilization of the local residents who have fallen into their hands. The fate of at least tens of thousands of Mariupol residents who were previously relocated to Russian-controlled territory is unknown. Unfortunately, we do not hear a response from Russia to the exchange offer, which could save the civilians and defenders of Mariupol. And this silence should be noted by all who have been or may be associated with Russia. When your fate is decided, Moscow will be silent. This is illustrative. And this is the best argument not to have contacts with the Russian Federation. In the south of our country, the occupiers are trying to demonstrate at least something that can be presented in Russia as the alleged readiness of Ukrainians to cooperate with Russian structures. It looks pathetic. After 55 days of war, the occupiers didn't manage to attract anyone to their side except for some outcasts. The situation is quite clear - Ukrainians in all regions of our state support Ukrainian national unity. They support our national statehood. And I am grateful to all the residents of the temporarily occupied cities, temporarily occupied communities - Kherson, Kakhovka, Melitopol and all our other communities - for this clear position. No cooperation with the occupiers. No support for the collaborators. The more principled we are, the more principled you will be, the sooner normal life will return. I held a meeting with representatives of the Verkhovna Rada today. We discussed the plan of parliamentary work, agreed on important draft decisions for the state, which need to be adopted in the near future. In particular, the deputies were offered to support the technical decision to extend the martial law. This is necessary for the legal support of the defense of our state and the stable operation of all structures. We also discussed a bill on the procedure for deploying the capacities of the enterprises that were evacuated from the combat zone. A bill with amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code of Ukraine, which are necessary for cooperation with the International Criminal Court. A bill on the legal regime in the temporarily occupied territories. The conversation was substantive, and I hope that the deputies will work out these bills soon enough. I spoke today with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. Informed him about the current situation in the areas of hostilities and especially in Donbas. Expressed gratitude for the strong support for Ukraine. We coordinated the next steps needed to protect our state and freedom in Europe. Agreed to increase the supply of heavy weapons, including armored vehicles. I also spoke with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. In particular, on the defensive, financial and humanitarian needs of Ukraine. We are accelerating procedures so that Ukraine can move forward in European integration as fast as possible. Now, during the war, this movement and its speed are also elements of protection of our state, preservation of freedom for our people. More and more global companies are announcing the shutdown in Russia. Today, the German company Henkel has joined hundreds of other such large companies. I want to emphasize that this is inevitable: any normal business will have to make such a decision and leave Russia. Now the Russian state is at a level where any association with it and any support for it means complicity in mass killings. Complicity in what will be called crimes against humanity and genocide. Before delivering this address, I signed the traditional decree on awarding our defenders. 286 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 229 of them are servicemen of the 36th separate brigade of marines, which together with other units heroically defends Mariupol. Maximum gratitude from all the Ukrainian people to the 36th brigade, Azov, the 12th brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, border guards, Right Sector volunteers, the 555th military hospital, police officers and territorial defense. Eternal glory to everyone who stood up for Mariupol, our entire state and the people of Ukraine! Eternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
President discussed with the people's deputies the most important legislative initiatives for the activities of the state during the war,2022-04-19T18:52:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a meeting with the leadership of the Verkhovna Rada, representatives of the parliamentary corps and members of the government on legislative initiatives that are of paramount importance for the state's activities in wartime. Particular attention was paid to the draft laws that need urgent consideration at the next sitting of the Verkhovna Rada. In particular, the parties discussed the need to approve the decree of the President of Ukraine on the prolongation of martial law, bills to regulate the legal regime in the temporarily occupied territory, the procedure for locating production facilities evacuated due to armed aggression of the Russian Federation, amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code of Ukraine on cooperation with the International Criminal Court. Also consideration is required for the draft laws on the organization of the work of providers of electronic communications networks in martial law, features of privatization of state property in this period, improvement of sanctions and recovery of assets of individuals and legal entities for the state revenue, deregulation in the supply of agricultural products during martial law.

"We, the world and history will take from Russia much more than Russian missiles will take from Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-04-18T23:15:00Z,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! The 54th day of our defense against the Russian invasion is coming to an end. The Russian army is not slowing down the use of missiles against Ukraine. Although it should have realized that it will be extremely difficult for it to restore the missile arsenal given even already imposed sanctions. Without imports, they can't even do that. And when all the loopholes used to circumvent sanctions are closed, and when even tougher sanctions are imposed, restoring Russia's missile capabilities will be unrealistic. That is, Russian missile strikes lead to only one thing - missile self-demilitarization of the Russian Federation. A similar process is taking place with other Russian weapons. Producing new artillery, aircraft, new helicopters and cruisers under sanctions will be a daunting task for Russia. None of the missile strikes has changed the situation for Russia tangibly. And if you evaluate them all together, the conclusion will be - this is strategic nonsense. Today's strikes at Lviv, at the Dnipropetrovsk region and any other Russian strikes mean only one thing: we, the world and history will take from Russia much more than Russian missiles will take from Ukraine. Every lost life is an argument for Ukrainians and other free nations to perceive Russia exclusively as a threat generation after generation. And any infrastructure can be restored. And we will definitely do it. In the east and south of our country, the occupiers are recently trying to attack in a little more thought-out manner than before. They are putting pressure, looking for a weak spot in the defense of our state to go there with the main forces... Apparently, Russian generals, accustomed to neglecting any losses, have already killed so many Russian servicemen that even they have to be more careful, as there will be no one left to attack. However, they should not hope this will help them. It is only a matter of time when the whole territory of our state will be liberated. It can now be stated that Russian troops have begun the battle for Donbas, for which they have been preparing for a long time. A very large part of the entire Russian army is now focused on this offensive. No matter how many Russian soldiers are driven there, we will fight. We will defend ourselves. We will do it daily. We will not give up anything Ukrainian, and we do not need what's not ours. And I am grateful to all our fighters, to all our heroic cities in Donbas, to Mariupol, and also to the cities of the Kharkiv region which are holding on, defending the fate of the whole state, repelling the forces of invaders. Rubizhne, Popasna, Zolote, Lysychansk, Severodonetsk, Kramatorsk and all others that have been with Ukraine all these years and forever. I spoke with the President of the Republic of Lithuania and friend of our country Gitanas Nausėda. I informed him about the situation in the combat zones and especially about the situation in Mariupol. We are coordinating our actions to increase Russia's liability for the war. I also spoke with the Prime Ministers of Bulgaria and Croatia. About the threats created by Russia to free navigation in the Black Sea, about our cooperation at the level of the European Union, about the effective support for Ukraine and the development of solutions for the restoration of peace. I held an important meeting today on the post-war reconstruction and development of Ukraine. We need to work out everything in detail already now to be fully prepared when the war is over. We are developing a comprehensive plan that provides for the reconstruction of what’s destroyed, the modernization of state structures and the maximum acceleration of Ukraine's development. It is not just about the amount of physical work - to build housing, restore businesses, attract new businesses that will work to rebuild infrastructure and renew economic relations in our country. It is also about rethinking how our country will develop in the future. What industries can be the basis of growth after the war. What solutions and resources are needed to increase the level of processing in Ukraine and stop selling raw materials, as it was before. Which cities will become the locomotives of economic and technological growth, pulling up the surrounding areas. As of now - if you listen carefully to all the discussions that are taking place in our country at different levels about the post-war reconstruction - the main topic in them is actually about money. What financial package is needed to recover from the war? But I always emphasize that money is not the foundation for the country's development. Ideas, people - that's the foundation. And when there are ideas, when there are our people, you begin to see what money is needed for and in what amount. We need to have a clear vision of this or that branch of our economy, the direction of development we expect from this or that city, the benefits this or that institution can bring to the state as a whole. Of course, for small and medium-sized businesses we must provide the most comfortable and free environment. In terms of taxes and administrative relations. Of course, digitization is a top priority. Security is also a top priority for us. Defensive potential must be at a new level. Of course, judicial, anti-corruption and other important reforms need to be brought to fruition. But all this must work for a concrete vision of what Ukraine will be like. What it will be like a year after the war, 5 years after the war, 10, 20 years after. What exactly will be important for our people. What exactly will be important for global business. How many jobs and in what industries will be available to Ukrainians. Ukraine's accession to the European Union is an integral part of this strategic vision. And in this context, today was a historic event - we are going through one of the stages before joining the EU. We provided answers to a questionnaire received from Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, and Josep Borrell, Head of European Diplomacy. Each country that joined the European Union went through the same procedure with the questionnaire. The only difference is that it took them years, and we completed it in a little more than a week. We will provide the second part of the answers shortly. And we hope that Europe’s decision in response will be quick. The status of a candidate for membership in the European Union will open for us unprecedented opportunities in our history for the restoration and modernization of Ukraine. We are negotiating with countries at the bilateral level and with international financial institutions to support our country's reconstruction program. Of course, we will involve global business as much as possible. But we are primarily interested in creating jobs and added value in Ukraine. Therefore, localization will continue to be an important process for us. In the evening I signed a traditional decree on awarding our heroes. 192 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 24 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Eternal glory to each of our defenders! Glory to Ukraine!"
Volodymyr Zelenskyy handed over a completed questionnaire for Ukraine’s obtaining of the EU candidate status to Matti Maasikas,2022-04-18T17:01:00Z,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy handed over a completed questionnaire for Ukraine's obtaining of the EU candidate status to Head of the Delegation of the European Union to Ukraine Matti Maasikas. ""I want to thank you for this important meeting. Today is one of the stages for our country in joining the European Union, the aspiration that our people are striving for and fighting for,"" he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy reminded that the questionnaire was handed over to him by President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen during her visit to Kyiv together with EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell. The President of Ukraine noted that our country's progress towards the EU is taking place at a very tragic time, when many Ukrainians who profess European values are losing their lives. ""However, the people of Ukraine are united by this goal - to feel equal, part of Europe, part of the European Union,"" he said. The President thanked Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Council Charles Michel, Josep Borrell and Matti Maasikas for the prompt work on providing the questionnaire. ""It's an important signal. We believe that we will gain support and become a candidate for accession. After that, the next, final stage will begin. We believe that this procedure will take place in the coming weeks and that it will be positive for the history of our people, given the price it paid on the path to independence and democracy,"" the President said. According to Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, the government and the team of the Office of the President have prepared responses in a prompt manner, and work is already underway on Ukraine's integration into the European Union. ""We are already integrated into the EU electrical grid. We are now continuing to work with the European Commission on the integration and joint network of free roaming and free payment space,"" the Prime Minister said. He noted that this work took place in parallel with the completion of the questionnaire for EU membership. For her part, Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration Olga Stefanishyna noted that the questionnaire is a ""book of Ukrainian statehood."" ""All these changes that we have made, that we are fighting for now. It's about human rights, the highest human values, the economy, the changes and transformations we've really fought for,"" she said. Andriy Yermak, Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, stressed that accelerating the process of European integration of our country would be impossible without the heroism of the Ukrainian military and all our people. ""Therefore, I believe that this is a very powerful step for our victory,"" Andriy Yermak stressed. Head of the Delegation of the European Union to Ukraine Matti Maasikas said he also feels part of a team working to give Ukraine EU candidate status. He noted that this process is taking place in a very difficult situation for the Ukrainian state, but everyone feels the importance and significance of this moment. According to Matti Maasikas, Ukraine's answers in the questionnaire will be analyzed very quickly. Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked him for the fact that the EU Delegation had resumed its work in Kyiv. ""This is an important signal that the ambassadors are returning, we are glad to see you,"" the President said."
President held a meeting on the post-war reconstruction of the country,2022-04-18T13:34:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a meeting to discuss the country's post-war reconstruction and development plan. The event was attended by Head of the Office of the President Andriy Yermak, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, Deputy Heads of the Office of the President, members of the Government, the leadership of the parliamentary majority and relevant committees of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. According to Denys Shmyhal, the post-war reconstruction plan consists of several parts, and international audit companies, Ukrainian think tanks, parliamentary committees and ministries have joined its development. The plan envisages the restoration of Ukraine on new principles using all available resources and opportunities. In particular, it is planned to cover the material damage caused by the war, restore the destroyed infrastructure capacity and carry out structural modernization of the Ukrainian economy. Особливу увагу під час наради було акцентовано на проведенні низки важливих економічних реформ. The participants also discussed the course of Ukraine's European integration and obtaining candidate status for accession to the European Union."
"The answer to the attempt of ""ruble occupation"" of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions must be full coverage of the Russian banking system by sanctions - address by the President of Ukraine",2022-04-17T23:41:00Z,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! Today, Christians of the Western rite celebrate Easter. The happiest Christian holiday. A holiday of the victory of life over death. The Ukrainian Catholic community unites millions of people. And I sincerely wish everyone peace. I wish you to keep the light of soul even in this dark time of war against our state. To keep it to see how good will soon surely defeat evil for the sake of our country, and how the truth will overcome any lies of the occupiers. A wonderful gift for the holiday was made by our team at the ""Invictus Games"", in which veterans and servicemen take part. On the first day of the competition, which started in the Netherlands, the Ukrainians won ""gold"", ""silver"" and ""bronze"". Rodion Sitdikov won the ""gold"" in the shot put. Artem Lukashuk and Ivan Heretsun brought Ukraine ""silver"" and ""bronze"" in long jump. Thank you guys from all of us, from all Ukrainians! This is always important, and now it is extremely important. To glorify our flag, to perform the Ukrainian national anthem and to honor our heroes. But whatever the day and whatever the holiday, the task remains the same for everyone in power. Work not even one hundred, but two hundred percent to ensure our defense. Provide Ukraine with weapons, financial support and all other supplies. I began this day with a meeting with the military and government officials on the situation in combat zones. Russian troops are preparing for an offensive operation in the east of our country. It will begin in the near future. They want to literally finish off and destroy Donbas. Destroy everything that once gave glory to this industrial region. Just as the Russian troops are destroying Mariupol, they want to wipe out other cities and communities in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. We are doing everything to ensure defense. We are in constant contact with partners. We are grateful to those who really help with everything they can. But those who have the weapons and ammunition we need and delay their provision must know that the fate of this battle also depends on them. The fate of people who can be saved. The 53rd day of the war is over, and we have been waiting for answers to some points in our weapons inquiries for 53 days. And some answers are formulated so that delivery can begin only in May. I speak directly in such cases: every delay in weapons, every political delay is a permission for Russia to take the lives of Ukrainians. This is how Russia interprets it. That should not be the case in reality. Constant shelling of our city of Kharkiv continues. Today, Russian troops hit, in particular, the streets of Culture, Shevchenko and Darwin. Apparently, these are especially dangerous words for Russia - ""culture"", ""Shevchenko"", ""Darwin"". This is something that threatens its existence. As of this moment, the list of dead from this strike includes five Kharkiv residents and at least 15 wounded. In the last four days alone, 18 people have been killed and 106 have been wounded by the Russian shelling of Kharkiv. This is nothing but deliberate terror. Mortars, artillery against ordinary residential neighborhoods, against ordinary civilians. The democratic world must also react to what the occupiers are doing in the south of Ukraine - in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Torture chambers are built there. They abduct representatives of local authorities and anyone deemed visible to local communities. They blackmail teachers. They steal money provided for paying pensions. Humanitarian aid is blocked and stolen. They create starvation. The occupiers are also trying to tear off the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, following the example of the so-called DPR and LPR. This territory is being transferred to the ruble zone and subordinated to the administrative machine of Russia. All this requires greater speed from Western countries in preparing a new powerful package of sanctions. The answer to the attempted ""ruble occupation"" of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions must be full coverage of the Russian banking and financial systems by sanctions. Because they are part of the occupation machine. Of course, the need for an embargo on oil supplies from Russia is growing every day. Everyone in Europe and America already sees Russia openly using energy to destabilize Western societies. Russia's bet on chaos in fuel markets should not succeed. And today I really want to support once again all those who are fighting for Ukraine in the cities and communities of the south of our state. Who protect our national symbols. Who protect our freedom. Every manifestation of such a struggle makes it difficult for the occupiers to carry out their task. Sabotage the orders of the occupiers. Do not cooperate with them. Protest. It is necessary to hold on so that Russia does not manage to distort life in other cities of Ukraine, like it did in Donetsk and Luhansk. I spoke today with Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund Kristalina Georgieva. On ensuring the financial stability of Ukraine and on preparations for the reconstruction of our state after the war. We touched upon specific areas of possible cooperation with the IMF both in the near future and in the next few years. I am confident that progress in our relations with the fund will be tangible. And I want to thank Mrs. Kristalina for her personal and significant support. Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal reported today on the implementation of the order on additional social assistance due to the war. First. Every displaced person can receive financial assistance for living. Every month it is 2 thousand hryvnias for an adult and 3 thousand hryvnias for a child. It is possible to apply for this in the nearest administrative services center, bodies of social protection, and starting from Wednesday - in ""Diia"". Second. People are being evacuated from the war-torn areas. The government is deploying special locations to ensure temporary accommodation for people and provide financial assistance immediately at railway and bus stations. Third. Applications for destroyed or damaged housing are being collected through ""Diia"". Be sure to apply if you have lost an apartment, house or if they have been damaged by shelling. Fourth. I urge employers, no matter how difficult it may be, to try to employ displaced persons. Now every job saved and every extra job is helping protect the state in war. For each displaced person whom the business hires, the company will receive co-financing of labor costs from the state. This is 6,500 hryvnias. The application can also be submitted on the ""Diia"" portal. Traditionally in the evening I signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 188 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 553 warriors of the National Guard. 64 border guards. 5 police officers, 26 employees of the State Emergency Service. 6 defenders of Ukraine were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. And finally. Another congratulation - also for our heroes, for Ukrainian firefighters. Today is the Day of Firefighters. And I sincerely congratulate everyone who protects the security of our people, our land from fire. Who is at war almost every day even in peacetime. Thank you for your service! Thank you for saving us! Glory to Ukraine!"
We are fighting for a free future and the development of our country – the address of the President of Ukraine,2022-04-16T23:54:00Z,"Dear free people of the most beautiful country! A country that has a future. That's true. This is what motivates us to fight now. On the battlefield and around the clock on the diplomatic, information and economic fronts. This is what allows us to plan our lives after the war. Our Ukrainian free, sovereign and democratic future. Definitely – peaceful. Definitely – with development. Today I held a meeting dedicated to the reconstruction of our cities. Of course, this is a huge amount of work. But still less than defending the state in war. Than that we all – all Ukrainians, our army and all our people – are already really doing. So don't be afraid of the scale. What is important in our project of reconstruction of Ukraine? The task is not only to physically rebuild the houses, apartments, bridges and roads, businesses and social infrastructure that were destroyed by Russian troops. Not just to give people back everything they lost and give them a new foundation in life. Now it is a historic moment. The moment when we can solve many old problems of the whole environment of our life once and for all. When we can make quality urban planning where it did not exist. We can take into account real traffic flows. Guarantee energy saving, environmental friendliness of materials, inclusiveness. This is when it comes to the organization of living space and the quality of reconstruction. But there is also justice. Housing queues have existed for decades and never ended. This has been the case since Soviet times. Millions of people know how difficult it is to get a home, earn money for their own apartment, build a house. It has always been especially painful for the military, law enforcement, and public sector workers. For those who work for society and receive very little from the state for it. Last year, I set a task for the government – to do everything possible to provide all veterans, who were waiting in line, with housing this year. Next, we planned to provide all our military with housing. And now we are actually expanding last year's task to the whole state and refining it so that it would be a real modernization of Ukrainian cities and Ukrainian communities. And we combine this with the housing energy modernization program. As a result, there will be several stages. Today, I set a task to provide temporary housing to all our IDPs at the first stage. Those whose house was destroyed by war. Temporary housing until we rebuild their homes. Or until people receive compensation in square meters or money. In the second stage, we restore what the occupiers tried to destroy. All affected cities and communities. And at the third stage, we provide housing for all those who have defended or are defending the state, who have worked or are working in the interests of society, and do not have their own housing. It can no longer be the case that a person devotes his whole life to military service, but retires without having his own apartment. It can no longer be the case that a son or daughter is defending Ukraine in the war, and a father and mother do not have their own housing and are forced to live in a rented apartment or look for other options. It can no longer be the case that a doctor or nurse, teacher or law enforcement officer spends his whole life honestly and stays in a dormitory for decades, if not for life. The government, all central authorities together with local authorities must ensure this. And they will ensure. Everyone in Ukraine has the right to their own housing, their own home or their own apartment. The right to a safe and comfortable living space that will be designed for anyone. All those whose homes were destroyed by the occupiers, and all those who were waiting in line for many years. All our people who deserve to live in a modern environment. To implement this project, we are already involving leading architects, the full potential of the state and international support. The participation of companies, partner countries, international donors can be added. I have absolutely no doubt that we will be able to do this. It will be possible not only to restore that was destroyed, but also to restore justice for those whose right to housing has been violated. We also discussed the issue of memorializing what Ukrainians experienced during this war. They discussed how to preserve parts of this experience so that it would always remind all generations of our people of the brutal and senseless invasion Ukraine has been able to fend off. As one of the examples, a project of a memorial complex is being prepared, which will tell the story of the destroyed bridge in Kyiv region, which connected Irpin and Bucha with Kyiv. The story of people, who escaped from Russian invaders to Kyiv using this bridge and this road. I met today with servicemen of the State Service for Special Communications and Information Protection. I handed over awards. The contribution of special communications servicemen to our defense, to our path to victory and peace, cannot be overestimated. Their work should be mentioned more often, they should be thanked more loudly. Since the first day of the war, we have had stable communication both within our country and with Ukraine's partner states. I am sincerely grateful to everyone who provides it! I spoke today with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson and Prime Minister of Sweden Magdalena Andersson. On defense and other support for Ukraine. On toughening the sanctions policy against Russia. On the situation in various areas of hostilities in Ukraine, and especially on Mariupol. And about options to help city defenders and civilians. The situation in Mariupol remains as severe as possible. Just inhuman. This is what the Russian Federation did. Deliberately did. And deliberately continues to destroy cities. Russia is deliberately trying to destroy everyone who is there in Mariupol. There are only two ways to influence this. Or the partners will give Ukraine all the necessary heavy weapons, planes, and, without exaggeration, immediately. So that we can reduce the pressure of the occupiers on Mariupol and unblock it. Or – a negotiating path, in which the role of partners should also be decisive. I want to be heard right now: there has not been a single day since the blockade of Mariupol that we have not sought a solution. Military or diplomatic – anything to save people. But finding this solution is extremely difficult. So far, there is no one hundred percent valid option. This applies to both military options and the negotiation process. Although we have heard many intentions from those who wanted to help and who really in positions of international influence, none of them have been realized yet. However, we will not abandon these efforts. And every day either I, or Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Valeriy Zaluzhny, or other military, or head of our negotiating team David Arakhamia – in touch with our defenders of Mariupol. Every day. Traditionally, before the evening address, I signed a decree on awarding our defenders. 186 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. 13 servicemen of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Two officers of the Security Service of Ukraine. And one fighter of the National Guard. Eternal glory to all who defend the state! Eternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
"The more Russia escalates, the less likely the President of Ukraine is to negotiate",2022-04-16T22:22:00Z,"Escalation of Russian aggression and committing war crimes by Russia, including against civilians, reduce the chance for negotiations. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an interview with Ukrainian media. ""The stronger we are, the better the outcome of these talks will be. The more Borodianka-like cases appear, there will be no chance that negotiations will be held actually,"" the Head of State said. Zelenskyy is convinced that crimes against civilians and the Ukrainian military are a big mistake of Russians. ""The destruction of all our guys in Mariupol – what they are doing now – can put an end to any format of negotiations. I think it is their big mistake to say that they really want to end the war,"" he added. The President also said that Ukrainians and the world have already seen what the occupiers did to Bucha and Borodianka, but so far no one knows for sure the scale of the crimes in Mariupol, as there is no access to the city. At the same time, according to Zelenskyy, negotiations are needed to defend the state and end the war. According to him, Ukraine constantly offered a meeting of the leaders of the two countries during the war, but the Russian side insists on organizing such a meeting only when final agreements are reached on all points. The head of the Ukrainian state said that he did not consider such an approach correct. In his opinion, some points need to be prepared and agreed before the meeting with Vladimir Putin, but in the end everything should be agreed only at the talks of the leaders. ""I am in favor of a faster meeting with Russia. I don't think it will be one meeting. I don't think we can meet once and agree on everything, because there are a lot of issues, and I don't see in some of them that they will take our version or we will accept their version,"" Zelenskyy said. In particular, according to the President, the issue of settling the status of the occupied territories of Donbas and Crimea remains open, as Ukraine and Russia have different understandings of the sovereignty of these territories. ""I think we need to talk about it. And find a model that may not give an answer to what to do with it today, but it will definitely allow everyone to become sober. At least them. When the fighting is over and the war is over, we can think of diplomacy. And they want to resolve issues diplomatically when there is a war. This is very difficult. And that's why they want to take away some of our territory, to occupy more to put pressure. Then it's not about diplomacy. And why do we meet? Why should I meet if they want to occupy the whole territory?"" Zelenskyy said. In his opinion, it is possible to speak without bias, in particular about the neutral status, only after the ceasefire and withdrawal of military equipment. The head of state also said that the Russian side in the talks wants to sign a single document that would contain solutions to all issues.
 ""But all (other countries which are potential participants in the agreement) do not quite see themselves at the same table with the Russian Federation,"" the President said. According to him, other states distinguish between security guarantees for Ukraine and agreements with Russia. ""Russia wants everything to be in one document. And people say: they saw what happened in Bucha, circumstances are changing… And they less and less want to have any agreements with Russia. At the same time, they want to have agreements with Ukraine,"" Zelenskyy said. Therefore, in his opinion, the outcome of negotiations to end the war can be two different documents: security guarantees from partner countries and a separate document with Russia.

Ukraine needs supply of weapons from partner countries be accelerated – President,2022-04-16T22:04:00Z,"Ukraine needs the supply of various types of weapons from partner countries be accelerated, because the lives of Ukrainians and the further success of our country in the fight against the aggressor depend on it. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an interview with Ukrainian media. The head of state said that the people of some countries, which were hesitant about the supply of weapons to Ukraine, began to put pressure on the government, and this allowed accelerating this process. ""From the moment they say that we (governments or parliaments) have decided to confirm the supply of weapons to Ukraine, to the moment when these weapons are already in our arsenal, in our army, two or three weeks may pass. This is a very long process,"" Zelenskyy said. The President said that in some parts of the front, in particular in the Joint Forces Operation area or in Mariupol, new weapons are required as soon as possible, and there is no time to wait. ""People say: we need help now, it is a matter of one, two, or three days, and people (from partner countries) say: everything is fine, we will give you in May. What they are counting on? That we will fight for months? Years of war? Some of them are probably counting on it. But for us, the acceleration (of the supply) of weapons is a very important moment,"" the Head of State said. Zelenskyy said that recently the rhetoric of some countries regarding the supply of weapons to Ukraine has changed in our favor. ""We have changed this rhetoric. Some changed it because of the pressure of the people… Because of this pressure, they also changed the process and unblocked the supply,"" he said. The President said that Ukraine receives weapons from other countries, but these weapons are still not enough. ""The United States, the United Kingdom, Poland and several other countries support us very well today. But they can do more, much more. And the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic support honestly and openly,"" the President said. Zelenskyy also expressed confidence that Ukraine will have no problems with the supply of new weapons. ""We will not have a problem with weapons, any weapons, upgraded one. This is the feeling I have judging the signals we had,"" the President of Ukraine said."
Zelenskyy meets with servicemen of Special Communications Service,2022-04-16T17:52:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with servicemen of the State Service for Special Communications and Information Protection and handed over state awards. ""Before the war, we used to say calmly at the end of a conversation, ""We'll keep in touch with you."" And I never thought that we would say the same words differently – because of the war,"" the head of state said, addressing the State Special Communications Service. Zelenskyy said that in particular, thanks to their work, today the Armed Forces and the civilian population have a reliable connection, among other things, with public authorities. ""It is very important that we have a modern, almost uninterrupted connection with our Western partners since the first day of the war,"" he said.
 According to the President, this makes it possible to resolve many important issues both on the military and diplomatic fronts. Zelenskyy thanked the special communications servicemen for their service, wished them good health and noted that their families can be proud of such relatives. The head of state presented state awards to the servicemen of the State Service for Special Communications and Information Protection.

"Comprehensive approach needed to housing reconstruction in Ukraine, taking into account needs of civilians, military – Zelenskyy",2022-04-16T17:26:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a meeting on the restoration and reconstruction of housing infrastructure in the country that was destroyed or damaged in the war with Russia. The meeting was also attended by Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak and his deputy Kyrylo Tymoshenko, Minister of Infrastructure of Ukraine Oleksandr Kubrakov, the leadership of the Servant of the People parliamentary faction, well-known Ukrainian architects. The head of state listened to proposals on solving problems with the construction of temporary housing in settlements affected by the war, in particular on the example of Kyiv region. For this purpose it is planned to build special modular towns. It is expected that this will be high-quality, comfortable housing in which residents of the affected cities will be able to live for a long time, while the reconstruction of their homes or the construction of new housing continues. Zelenskyy said that any projects to restore or develop housing infrastructure should be aimed at ensuring that Ukrainians return home. They must also provide opportunities to address the issue of providing permanent housing for the Ukrainian military, which is heroically defending our country. In addition, the President studied a modern memorial complex project, which will tell the story of the world-famous destroyed bridge in the village of Romanivka, Kyiv region, connecting Irpin and Bucha with the city of Kyiv. According to the authors of the project, visitors to this complex will be able to immerse themselves in the atmosphere that prevailed during the evacuation in this place. ""It is important that we perpetuate this place. And people will be able to feel everything that happened here. It will be a monument to our path to victory,"" the President said.

Humanitarian center set up by President reports on results of work,2022-04-16T09:48:00Z,"The Coordination Center for Humanitarian and Social Affairs established by the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy, headed by the Head of the Office of the President Andriy Yermak, has reported on the results of its activities. According to Yermak, the amount of charitable assistance received for Ukraine from citizens and corporations from around the world has now reached almost $924 million, and funds continue to flow. ""They go mainly to the accounts of the UN and international humanitarian organizations. And they, in turn, send them to help our refugees in different countries,"" the head of the President's Office said. Most funds came from philanthropists from the United Kingdom (47%), the Netherlands (almost 18%), the Czech Republic (11%) and the United States (almost 8%). Yermak stressed that Ukraine is grateful for the help of both world celebrities and all concerned citizens from different countries. In particular, he said that the UK under the auspices of the Disasters Emergency Committee raised more than GBP 310 million. Queen Elizabeth II, the British government, film, theater and music stars have made their contributions. Famous Hollywood actress Mila Kunis, who was born in Chernivtsi, and her husband, actor Ashton Kutcher, raised $35 million in the United States. They sent these funds to the Flexport logistics startup and Airbnb technology company. In France, EUR 8 million were raised by local television thanks to a charity concert of French stars. The First Lady of France, Brigitte Macron, also joined – she donated EUR 1 million. Deputy Head of the Office of the President Yulia Sokolovska said that 270,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid had been imported to Ukraine in 50 days. Food was purchased from Ukrainian producers and meal kits were made for almost 10 million Ukrainians. The SpivDiia information resource processes applications from the hotline to meet the specific needs of citizens. More than 48,000 applications have already been processed, Sokolovska said. According to First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy of Ukraine Yulia Svyrydenko, logistics centers have been set up on the western border with Poland, Hungary, Romania, Moldova and Slovakia in the first week, where international donors and partners send humanitarian aid. Lviv region has become the largest hub of humanitarian support in Ukraine, receiving 51% of cargo from abroad. Among the humanitarian hubs located across the country, the cargo is distributed among regional military administrations, charities, local governments, NGOs and volunteers, Deputy Head of the Presidential Office Kyrylo Tymoshenko said. According to him, during the 50 days of the war, the whole country was united, and each non-frontline region helps the frontline region every day. In addition, as Tymoshenko said, with the help of the convenient platform help.gov.ua people from all over the world fill out questionnaires every day and send assistance to Ukraine. To resolve logistics issues, the Ministry of Infrastructure has a special logistics center, which includes Ukrzaliznytsia, Ukrposhta and other carriers. According to the deputy head of the President's Office, during the war Ukrzaliznytsia evacuated almost 4 million people by train free of charge. More than 1.3 million people from Kyiv and almost 500,000 from Kharkiv were evacuated. The total number of Ukrainians who traveled abroad by rail is about 500,000. People from the blocked cities and cities, which are most difficult in terms of safety, were evacuated via safe corridors. ""Unfortunately, there was fire against civilians, but since the beginning of the war, almost 300,000 people have been evacuated from Sumy, Zaporizhia, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk and Luhansk regions,"" the deputy head of the President's Office said. According to Svyrydenko, special attention is paid to the problem of fuel supply. From the first days of the war, the government agreed with the Polish Governmental Agency for Strategic Reserves to provide 20,000 tonnes of fuel as humanitarian aid. At the same time, an agreement was reached with the largest networks of gas stations on its dispensing through their gas stations to certain categories of recipients. Sokolovska, for her part, reminded that people receive psychological help within the framework of the Tell Me program. There is also a web platform for the effective collection and processing of information on case of violation of human rights by the Russian Federation.

"Adviser to President of Ukraine: Energy embargo should be imposed, sending money to support Russia's war crimes should be stopped",2022-04-16T09:19:00Z,"The Group of Seven (G7) countries and the European Union should impose an embargo on Russian energy, as well as help Ukraine close its budget deficit amid Russia's full-scale invasion of our territory. This was stated by adviser to the President of Ukraine on economic issues Oleh Ustenko in an interview with The New Yorker. In particular, he said that even after US President Joseph Biden called genocide what the Russian army is doing in Ukraine, European allies are dragging their feet about an energy embargo on Russia. ""We are saying, Look, guys… You are stopping caviar exports. However, what can really harm this Russian military machine is oil. And nothing has happened with oil. We just had talks and talks and talks, and then nothing happened,"" Ustenko said. According to him, some European countries are, in fact, buying more gas and oil than they were before the war. However, he suggested that some countries may have been trying to build up their energy reserves in anticipation of an embargo that they think is coming. The adviser to the President of Ukraine acknowledged that Germany and France, the EU's two largest economies, had reduced their imports of Russian oil and gas since the war began, but noted that they are still buying large amounts. According to Ustenko, Washington should exert more pressure on its European allies to join an energy embargo. He also called on the United States and other members of G7 to provide more financial support for the Ukrainian government as it tries to pay for the war and maintain social spending for its population. ""The contraction in our economy is huge,"" the adviser to the President of Ukraine said. ""Fifty per cent of our businesses are not fully operational. Our budget revenues have fallen substantially, and our budget deficit has increased. This deficit has to be financed."" Ustenko estimated the budget deficit at about $8 billion a month. According to him, With Ukraine effectively shut out of the international financial markets, he said, it can't issue more debt to cover this amount. If the G7 provided fifty billion dollars in new financing, that would resolve the deficit issue for at least another six months, he said. ""We need extra financial support, including from the United States. Of course, the United States was very kind, providing us with weapons. But it is not enough,"" the adviser to the President of Ukraine said. However, Ustenko said that the first priority must be the immediate imposition of an energy embargo, because that is where Russia is most vulnerable. In this case, in his opinion, the moral argument should be at least as compelling as the economic one. ""If somebody is committing a war crime and a third party is giving money to the war criminal, then, for us in Ukraine, this third party is also in the cycle of committing the same war crime. Because the third party, with his money, is in the position of supporting the war crime,"" the President's adviser said.

Tariffs for electricity for households with consumption up to 250 kWh not to grow – President,2022-04-16T09:14:00Z,"Tariffs for electricity for households of Ukraine with consumption up to 250 kWh per month will not increase and will amount to UAH 1.44 per kWh. This was announced by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a video address. According to the Head of State, energy issues were discussed during a meeting with government officials. ""We are extending the electricity tariff of UAH 1.44 per kilowatt for at least next six months for those who consume less than 250 kilowatts. This is 80% of our citizens,"" Zelenskyy said. Also, according to him, the meeting reviewed the results of the current heating season. ""The season was successful despite everything. Despite all the ""prophecies,"" the tariffs have not increased. There were no rotating outages. Supplies were not disrupted even in wartime. Preparations have also begun for the next heating season. We discussed the purchase of gas, the purchase of coal,"" the President said."
The effectiveness of instruments of influence on Russia determines how long this war will last - address by the President of Ukraine,2022-04-15T23:31:00Z,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! I am sure that you periodically see in the media - Ukrainian and Western - reports on how long this war can last. Some say a few weeks. Others - several years. Some say the war will last until the end of this year. And someone advises to prepare for a permanent confrontation with Russia as long as it exists. Of course, I also hear different predictions. I have much more information than some media outlets about the intentions and capabilities of the Russian army. About the potential of the Russian economy. About the emotional state of society in Russia. All this must be taken into account before saying how long the war will last. Therefore, we must take into account the effectiveness of instruments of influence on Russia used by Ukraine and our entire anti-war coalition against Russia's aggression. The success of our military on the battlefield is really significant. Historically significant. But not enough to clean our land from the occupiers yet. We'll beat them more. Sanctions against Russia are very significant. Economically painful. But still not enough for the Russian military machine to be left without means of subsistence. We promote stronger, more destructive ones. So, in fact, it is these two areas that determine how long this war will last. I always tell all our partners with whom I discuss this issue that the amount of support for Ukraine directly affects the restoration of peace. It literally defines how many more Ukrainians the occupiers will manage to kill. If someone says: year or years, I answer: you can make the war much shorter. The more and the sooner we get all the weapons we have requested, the stronger our position will be and the sooner peace will come. The more and the sooner we get the financial support we have requested, the sooner there will be peace. The sooner the democratic world recognizes that the oil embargo against Russia and the complete blockade of its banking sector are necessary steps towards peace, the sooner the war will end. So the number one task is to speed up the restoration of peace. Our Armed Forces are doing it brilliantly. They are repelling the occupiers' attacks. They are carrying out counterattacks. They have already tormented - in the true sense of the word - Russian conventional aviation so much that they are forced to use strategic long-range aircraft. I am grateful to each of our defenders for this great work. Our diplomats must continue their activity in all possible directions, at all possible levels. Both official and unofficial. The next package of sanctions against Russia must include an abandonment of Russian oil. In general, the democratic world must admit that money for Russian energy resources is in fact money for the destruction of democracy. When these decisions are made, we will all be able to see that peace is approaching. I held a meeting with government officials today. The key topic is the solution of urgent economic issues that arose during martial law. It was noted that four-fifths of all Ukrainian enterprises have already returned to work in a safe area. In particular, this applies to heavy industry enterprises. Transport networks are being rebuilt. Good performance is shown in trade and services. And all this is also the fulfillment of the national task of accelerating the restoration of peace. That is why I am grateful to everyone who keeps jobs, who employs our people, who helps businesses adapt to these difficult conditions and gives Ukraine the necessary economic strength to live. No matter what, in all cities and communities where there are no occupiers and hostilities, it is necessary to restore the economy to the maximum. Energy issues and the end of this heating season were discussed. The season was successful in spite of everything. Despite all the predictions, tariffs have not increased. There were no rolling blackouts. Supplies were not disrupted even in wartime. Preparations have also begun for the next heating season. We discussed the purchase of gas, the purchase of coal. We offer at least for the next 6 months the electricity tariff in the amount of 1 hryvnia 44 kopecks per kilowatt for those who use less than 250 kilowatts. This is 80% of our people. The Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food reported that the sowing campaign has begun and continues in all regions of our country, including Luhansk and Donetsk. We also talked to government officials today about filling in the questionnaire that Ukraine received from President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. This is a necessary stage in the preparation of our country to become a candidate for EU membership. The work is almost complete, and we will soon provide the answers to the representatives of the European Union. I held an important meeting today with all the leaders of the state power bloc. Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Chief of the General Staff, Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate, Commander of the National Guard, Minister of Internal Affairs, Head of the Security Service of Ukraine. The meeting was also attended by the Head of the President's Office, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council and the head of our delegation at the negotiations. The main topic is Mariupol. Details cannot be made public at the moment. But we are doing everything to save our people. The restoration of normal life in those areas and districts where the occupiers were expelled continues. The amount of work is really huge. 918 settlements of different scales, but equally important for us, for Ukraine, have already been de-occupied. We carry out demining. We restore the supply of electricity, water and gas. We restore the work of the police, post office, state and local authorities. Humanitarian headquarters have started working on the territory of 338 liberated settlements. We are resuming the provision of regular and emergency medical care, the work of educational institutions - where it is really possible. In total, on this day, Russian troops have destroyed or damaged 1,018 educational institutions across our country. Restoration of roads and railways has begun. In particular, from tomorrow the railway connection with Chernihiv and Nizhyn will be restored. Trains are already running between the cities of the Sumy region. The teams of Ukravtodor and Ukrzaliznytsia work quite efficiently, and I am grateful to them for this speed. For giving people back a sense of normal life, which the occupiers tried to destroy forever. In the south and east of our country, the situation is still very difficult, far from talking about recovery. In the occupied districts of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, the Russian military continue to terrorize civilian residents of our country. They are looking for anyone who has ever been associated with the Ukrainian army or government agencies. The occupiers think that this will somehow make it easier for them to control the territory. But they are wrong. They deceive themselves. The problem of the occupiers is not that they are not accepted by some activists, veterans or journalists. Russia's problem is that the entire Ukrainian people does not accept it and will never accept it again. Russia lost Ukraine forever. Actually, it lost the whole world. It will not be accepted anywhere anymore. And the cruelty with which Russian troops are trying to conquer the Azov, Donbas, Kharkiv regions, only takes away even the slightest chance of these territories and these people to have any ties with this state at least sometime in the future. Maybe somewhere in Russia cruelty is respected. But in Ukraine cruelty is despised. And punished. And it is obligatory. Today I signed decrees on awarding our military. 237 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 34 of them posthumously. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Colonel Kashchenko Dmytro Valeriyovych, commander of the 58th separate motorized infantry brigade of the Operational Command ""North"" of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. For the personal example of heroism that inspires comrades in service, for extremely effective combat operations and concrete and very important results for maintaining the positions of our army and expelling the occupiers. And finally. The important words that hope always wins even under seemingly insurmountable circumstances. This Saturday, the Jewish community celebrates Passover. Holiday of liberation. Holiday of life. I sincerely wish all those who celebrate in Ukraine and in the world peace, good and the inevitable defeat of any evil that threatens freedom and life on earth. Chag Pesach Sameach! I am grateful to all our male defenders! I am grateful to all our female defenders! Glory to Ukraine!"
President held a meeting with members of the government on topical issues of martial law economy,2022-04-15T14:17:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a meeting with members of the Cabinet of Ministers and representatives of the Office of the Head of State on the topical issues of economic development under martial law and the priorities that need to be addressed. The parties discussed the restoration of business in our country. In particular, the restoration of heavy industry, metallurgy and mechanical engineering was noted. Special attention was paid to macroeconomic stability and inflation. The President heard reports from government officials on topical issues of the relevant ministries. They also discussed the completion of work on the first part of the questionnaire to obtain the candidate status for membership in the European Union. The questionnaire was handed over to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on April 8 in Kyiv. The agenda also included the issues of humanitarian aid, public expenditures, the functioning of Ukraine's energy system and the completion of the autumn-winter heating season, the work of Ukrzaliznytsia, sowing campaign and environmental policy under martial law."
A group of Ukrainian and international experts is tracking the transportation of Russian oil to prevent Russia from circumventing sanctions,2022-04-15T11:31:00Z,"A group of Ukrainian and international experts analyzing the real impact of sanctions against Russia is tracking Russian oil tankers through network analysis software. This was stated by Adviser to the President of Ukraine on economic issues Oleg Ustenko in a comment for The Economist. Experts are tracking energy supply routes, thanks to which ""Russia is desperately trying to finance its military machine."" Information for the group is provided by both international experts and government officials from other countries and even intelligence. In addition, the team uses network analysis software to establish the relationship between disparate data. The program analyzes the behavior of ships, taking into account various information. For example, the declared cargo, route and insurance data, as well as historical models of navigation in different weather and market conditions. You can even see the tonnage of the cargo on board the ship and see if there is a suspicion that there may be more cargo on board than stated. A group of experts has already managed to identify supplies of Kazakh oil, which they believe contain portions of clandestinely loaded Russian crude, says Oleg Ustenko. Warnings are sent to relevant governments and companies, as well as to Ukrainian ministries. A more recently developed approach uses satellites in low orbits to hoover up signals from shipborne radars. These are used for navigation and to avoid collisions, so mariners are disinclined to switch them off. Fancy software for signal processing geolocates the signals' sources, at times within just several hundred meters."
"During the 50 days of this war, Ukraine became a hero for the whole free world - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-04-14T23:59:00Z,"
Unbreakable people of the bravest country! We have withstood 50 days already. 50 days of Russian invasion, although the occupiers gave us a maximum of five. That's how they ""know us"". That's how they ""make friends with reality."" Russia did not start the war against Ukraine on February 24. Russian troops came to us in 2014. They captured our Crimea. They turned it into a large military base. They made the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov one of the most dangerous seas on the planet. They started a terrible, absolutely cynical war in our Donbas. They have been killing our people for 8 years. 14 thousand were killed during this time! How did the world respond to this? The question remained rhetorical. But that is why they decided they could afford a full-scale war. Some are still debating the severity of sanctions against the Russian Federation. But what is there to discuss when Russian troops are already repeating on our land what Europe saw only during World War II? During the 50 days of full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, they showed that Donbas is the main target for Russia. It is Donbas that Russia wants to destroy in the first place. It is the Luhansk and Donetsk regions that Russian troops are destroying as if they want only stones to be left. And no people to be left at all. They forcibly recruit residents of these areas into their army. They throw them into the worst battles, literally in the frontal of our defense. They are destroying the cities and villages of Donbas. They burn everything that endured eight years of that war. For 80 years, proud and tidy Kharkiv has not seen such torments that Russia has brought to it. Why do they destroy it? What can be achieved by burning Kharkiv? What exactly can destruction on Saltivka or on Freedom Square give to Russia? And these are no longer rhetorical questions. This is a question of how absurd this invasion of the Russian Federation is. How suicidal it is for everything that Russia allegedly ""protects"". For Russian culture, for relations with this nation, even for the Russian language. Russia is burning all this with its weapons. For decades at least. For generations. Ancient Chernihiv. Which is over a thousand years old. Which saw so many wars and so many invaders that at least in the XXI century it deserved peace and tranquility. But... Russia came. Came with the worst that Chernihiv has experienced since the X century. Since the period of Rus' relation to which Russia once claimed. Now this myth is also burned. Rus’ would not destroy itself. Strangers did that to it. Horde and other invaders. That's who came to our land today. And they are fighting in the same way - for the sake of looting and for the sake of torture. Thank God, the Armed Forces of Ukraine and our people, we defended most of our country. I remember the first day of the invasion of the Russian Federation. I remember what I was told on February 24. In particular, the strong of this world. To put it mildly, no one was sure that we would withstand it. Everyone sympathized. Many of them advised me to flee the country. Advised to actually surrender to tyranny. But they didn't know us either. And they did not know how brave Ukrainians are, how much we value freedom. Our opportunity to live the way we want. Not the people who rule in such a way that their army sees toilets for the first time in their lives in the occupied territories and steals even ordinary household appliances. The occupiers will be responsible for everything they have done in Ukraine. For everything they did to Ukrainians. They will be responsible for Bucha, Kramatorsk, Volnovakha, Okhtyrka. For Hostomel and Borodyanka. For Izyum, for Mariupol and all other cities and communities of Ukraine, which the Russian army pulled back to the period 80 years ago. To that terrible time, about which everyone in the world has always said: ""Never again."" Here it is again. Here it is now. And we will do everything to make it truly the last. Because the question ""How to guarantee security for Ukraine and for Europe?"" will never be rhetorical again. We will not allow this. I am grateful to everyone who supported our state. Who immediately asked how they could help. Who stood with us back to back and helped us get what is necessary for the defense of our state. This period, these 50 days have shown me many world leaders in a different way. Different states. I have seen great generosity in those who are not rich themselves. I have seen the extraordinary determination of those who were not taken seriously by global leaders. I have seen that the democratic world does have those whose will is enough to protect freedom from the onslaught of tyranny. I have seen politicians behaving as if they had no power. And I have seen non-politicians who did more in these 50 days than some statesmen who claimed leadership. But all that is just an add-on. An add-on for how Ukraine is defended by our people, all our people. Those who stopped the advance of endless columns of Russian equipment. Those who rebuff constant attacks in Donbas. Those who heroically defend Mariupol, helping our entire state to withstand. Those who stopped the offensive from the south. And made our Chornobaivka famous. Those who drove the enemy out of the north. Those who have shown that Russian aviation is defenseless, even though Russia has spent tens of billions of dollars on various systems to protect its aircraft. Those who have shown that Russian ships can go... to the bottom only. Those who help the army and society find everything they may need. Those who save, heal, those who teach. Conduct mine clearance. Who provide us all with a stable connection. Those who rebuilt supply chains for the whole country. Those who maintain financial stability, who saved the business and continued to work. Those who help the displaced persons. Those who started the sowing campaign. Those who give Ukraine the correct information and the necessary emotions. All our journalists, all those who united for the national telethon. 50 days of our defense is an achievement. Achievement of millions of Ukrainians. Everyone who made the main decision in life on February 24 - to fight. To be human. Not to give up. And not to betray. From time immemorial to the present day, mankind has been looking for heroes. People always appreciate heroes. They always support those who are brave. And always feel who is fighting for the good. During the 50 days of this war, Ukraine became a hero for the whole free world. For those who have the courage to call a spade a spade. For those who are not poisoned by propaganda. You have all become heroes. All Ukrainian men and women who withstood and do not give up. And who will win. Who will return peace to Ukraine. I'm sure of it. I spoke today with our team, which will take part in the Invictus Games international sports competition. Among them are both veterans and servicemen who are currently defending our state. They are deeply concerned that they had to go to the competition. I assured them that we will wait for their return and will support them in the competition just as sincerely. I believe that our team will make us proud of it this year as well. And traditionally, as every evening, I signed decrees on awarding those who excelled in the defense of the state. 221 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 34 of them posthumously. And two employees of the State Special Communications Service of Ukraine. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Major Kukurba Oleksandr Vasyliovych, chief of intelligence of the 299th tactical aviation brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Thanks to his courageous actions, dozens of enemy equipment units and hundreds of occupiers were destroyed. I also awarded those whose surnames cannot be told. But I awarded them for what is definitely good for everyone. Eternal glory to all who defend the state! Eternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
President talked to members of the Invictus Games - Ukraine team,2022-04-14T20:58:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke via a video call with members of the Invictus Games - Ukraine team who are now in The Hague to take part in the Invictus Games international sports competition. Most of the members of the team are current servicemen who defend Ukraine in the Armed Forces, the National Guard, the territorial defense and other structures of the security and defense sector. 19 Ukrainian athletes - defenders will compete with 500 veterans and servicemen from 18 NATO and Allied countries. ""It is an honor for us that you represent Ukraine. I believe that Ukraine is each of you. If you represent our country in The Hague today at the Invictus Games, you will show that Ukraine is unconquered,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The President noted that Russia's full-scale aggression against Ukraine, which is being rebuffed by our army, has been going on for 50 days. Today, Ukraine is one of the strongest states in the world, and Ukrainians are invincible. ""Victory is important for us, it is important to prove that we are all unconquered. And your team is part of the spirit of indomitability of Ukraine, the Ukrainian people and each of us,"" the Head of State is convinced. As Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted, the Ukrainian team of the Invictus Games is a reflection of our state - ""different people, but all strong, united for the sake of the result."" ""The only result is victory,"" he said. The Head of State together with Ukrainian athletes honored the memory of the coach of the archery team, ATO veteran since 2014 Dmytro Sydoruk who died in the battle for Ukraine in early April. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also noted that the world needs to know the story of a paramedic volunteer, a member of the national team Yulia Payevska (nicknamed ""Tayra""), who is currently being held captive by the Russian occupiers. ""This sip of freedom, which you can give with your participation, victories and stories about what is happening on our beautiful land and what tragedy the enemy has brought, - I think she will definitely get this sip. Because you will tell about her to journalists, media and other athletes. And you will tell not only with words, but first of all with victory,"" the Head of State emphasized. The President called on Ukrainian athletes to do everything possible to ensure that people in The Hague, where the Invictus Games take place, learn more about all the crimes committed by Russian troops in Ukraine. ""In The Hague today, you will basically fight for the Russian occupiers and all those who deserve that to be in The Hague in due time. Because what they did is a crime against the people, against the people of Ukraine,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The members of the team told the Head of State that they are determined to win the competition to show the indomitability of our Homeland. They stressed that in communication with athletes from other countries they tell the truth about the horrible events taking place in Ukraine. The President wished the Invictus Games - Ukraine team great victories."
"Either Russia will really seek peace, or it will leave the international arena forever as a result of this war - address by the President of Ukraine",2022-04-13T23:06:00Z,"Indomitable people of the bravest country! Today was a useful day for our state, for our defense against the Russian offensive. The presidents of four states - friends of Ukraine - arrived in Kyiv. Those who help us from the first days. Who did not hesitate to give us weapons. Who did not doubt whether to impose sanctions. And who is now at the level of the European Union pushing for a tougher sanctions package against the Russian Federation. Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia. I was very glad to meet with the presidents today. The negotiations were fruitful. It is important that the presidents visited Borodyanka in the Kyiv region, where they saw with their own eyes what the occupiers had done. For the presidents, this is another argument to push harder for tangible sanctions against Russia. First of all, we need an oil embargo. And Europe's clear readiness to give up all Russian energy. The European Union must stop sponsoring Russia's military machine. Western sanctions policy was also discussed today by a group of international experts led by Michael McFaul and Andriy Yermak. The group has been working for three weeks. It consists of international and Ukrainian experts who assess the sanctions imposed and how Russia is trying to circumvent them. The group has prepared concrete proposals on how to remove sanctions loopholes, which are constantly used by Russia, and how to immediately enhance sanctions to make it tangible for Moscow. I spoke today with US President Biden. The topics of the conversation included the prosecution of all Russian servicemen and commanders who committed war crimes. International cooperation for this. A new package of defensive support for Ukraine was discussed. The agreement was reached. $ 800 million. Weapons, ammunition, other assistance. Artillery systems, armored personnel carriers, helicopters. Sincere gratitude for your support! We also agreed to enhance sanctions against Russia. I addressed the Parliament and the people of Estonia. Expressed gratitude for the help provided to Ukraine, including weapons. I also called on Estonia to join the project of Ukraine's reconstruction after the war. We are already cooperating with Estonia in the field of digitization. And after the war it could become an even bigger project. On restoration of government and business digital systems, on cybersecurity. On restoration of the relevant educational institutions. Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan visited Bucha. It is right that a group of forensic experts from the International Criminal Court will start working in the city. Responsibility for the Russian military for war crimes is inevitable. We will drag them all to the tribunal. And not only for what was done in Bucha. In general, in the north of our country, in the liberated areas, mine clearance continues. The occupiers left tens of thousands of unexploded shells, mines and tripwire mines - a lot of everything. Therefore, everyone who wants to return home to the liberated territory should be as careful as possible, as attentive as possible. And immediately inform the police and rescuers in case you find a strange object, an explosive object. Combat reports for today do not differ significantly from previous ones. Russian troops are stepping up activity in the eastern and southern directions. They are trying to retaliate for their defeats. Rocket bombings and artillery strikes continue. New columns of equipment are being brought in. They are looking for reserves. They are trying to recruit residents of the south of our country - that is, from these temporarily occupied areas in addition to the so-called mobilization in certain districts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. All this feverish activity of the occupiers testifies first of all to their insecurity. To the fact that even with significant stocks of Soviet military equipment and a significant number of soldiers, whom the commanders do not spare at all, the Russian troops doubt their ability to break us, to break Ukraine. Well, we do everything to justify their doubts. And I am grateful to all our defenders who hold positions and teach Russian soldiers to think that this war against Ukraine can only end in Russia's strategic defeat - sooner or later. Either the Russian leadership will really seek peace, or as a result of this war, Russia will leave the international arena forever. And before delivering this address, as always, I signed decrees to award our defenders. 270 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 7 of them posthumously. 11 employees of the State Protection Department were also awarded. Another decree awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine to 2 servicemen of our Armed Forces. Posthumously. Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to everyone who protects the people and protects our state! Glory to Ukraine!"
Poland and the Baltic states are true friends of Ukraine and are always the first in supporting our state - Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-04-13T22:38:00Z,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted the leadership of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in the comprehensive support for Ukraine in the face of armed aggression by the Russian Federation. The President of Ukraine stated this to the media following the talks with the Presidents of the four countries in Kyiv. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that before the meeting, the leaders of Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia visited Bucha, Borodyanka and Dmytrivka in the Kyiv region, which were recently liberated from Russian occupation. ""This means that it is very important for them to see with their own eyes what happened in these small towns that were burned and tortured. This is what we discussed today. And this is not about war - this is about something horrible, tragic, something incomprehensible,"" he said. The Ukrainian Head of State stressed that the leaders of Poland and the Baltic states have always been side by side with Ukraine and they have been the first in everything from the very beginning in terms of supporting our state. ""The first to support Ukraine's desire to take its place in the European family. The first in the strong sanctions policy against the Russian Federation, which is being promoted in the EU countries. Even when we talk about weapons, armaments and equipping our army, the leaders of these countries were among the first,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The President would like Ukraine to have the same friendly, partnership, honest and open strategic relations with all neighboring countries. ""And I am confident that these four states will be the first in all pages of the future history of Ukraine. And we have a great future, because with such partners and friends we will definitely win,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy is convinced. For his part, Polish President Andrzej Duda said the last time he visited Ukraine was the day before the Russian invasion. He noted that the current visit is a sign of solidarity with Ukraine and its heroic people. Andrzej Duda also stressed that currently about 2 million Ukrainians (mostly women and children) are in Poland to protect themselves from war and death. The President of the Republic of Poland said that today he saw with his own eyes the consequences of Russian aggression. ""It's hard to believe. This is not war, this is terrorism. If someone sends aircraft and soldiers to bomb residential areas, to kill civilians, it is not war, but cruelty, banditry, terrorism,"" he said. Andrzej Duda stressed the importance of bringing those who committed crimes and who gave criminal orders to justice in international courts. The Polish leader noted that the sanctions applied must lead to the end of the war and prevent aggression in the future. He also expressed hope that a free, sovereign, independent Ukraine would soon become part of the European Union. President of Lithuania Gitanas Nausėda noted that the Ukrainian nation has shown its strength and determination in recent weeks and continues to demonstrate these qualities every day in battles. He also stressed that the Russian authorities must be held accountable for all heinous crimes committed by Russian soldiers in the Kyiv region. According to Gitanas Nausėda, Ukraine must win this war, and for this it needs support - military, armed, humanitarian, financial, economic. Gitanas Nausėda also called for tougher sanctions against Russia, including a full embargo on Russian oil and gas, sanctions against all Russian banks aimed to stop funding Vladimir Putin's war. The President of Lithuania also announced that they intend to create a hub of Ukrainian culture and education in Vilnius, which will work under the leadership of the First Ladies. ""Lithuanians feel the Ukrainian pain. We know that Ukraine will win and prosper, and we will remain partners and close friends,"" Gitanas Nausėda assured. President of the Republic of Estonia Alar Karis stressed the need to push Russian troops further east to ensure peace in Europe. He also stated that he, together with all the Estonian people, deeply sympathizes with Ukraine over the horrors the Russian occupiers did to the Ukrainians. Alar Karis stressed that all these crimes must be investigated, and they must be taken into account when applying a new package of sanctions against Russia. However, according to him, since diplomatic efforts have not helped avoid armed confrontation, Ukraine must receive assistance in the form of necessary weapons. President of the Republic of Latvia Egils Levits noted that the process of bringing the aggressor to justice for war crimes committed against Ukrainians is already underway in international courts. ""I support the need for a special court or tribunal that will deal with the crime of aggression. Because so far there is no such international court where one can be convicted for such a crime with such a composition,"" he said. The President of Latvia is also convinced that Ukraine needs armed assistance now. ""Ukraine is fighting for us, and it is our duty to help by all means, weapons, so that Ukraine can defend itself from the enemy,"" said Egils Levits. The Latvian leader noted that today all NATO member states must help Ukraine with effective weapons. In addition, the Republic of Latvia can help with grain exports."
The McFaul-Yermak international expert group has developed an action plan to enhance sanctions against Russia,2022-04-13T20:37:00Z,"Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak held a regular meeting of a group of Ukrainian and international experts who analyze the real impact of sanctions against Russia and make proposals to strengthen them. At the beginning of the meeting, he noted that the McFaul-Yermak international expert group has been working for three weeks. President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the Office of the Head of State highly appreciate the efforts of the experts, and this area is one of the key priorities for Ukraine today. ""Our common goal is to stop the war, and for that we must defeat Russia with all possible and impossible sanctions. I know that our experts now have two pages of priority sanctions against Russia, which are proposed for the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and other partners,"" Andriy Yermak said. According to him, the list includes a full embargo on crude oil and natural gas exports, additional bans on financial institutions in both Russia and Belarus, further trade barriers and customs duties, and other powerful measures. Approaches to strengthening personal restrictions and imposing secondary sanctions are also being developed. Andriy Yermak noted that Ukrainian experts have already proposed their part of the action plan. Former National Security Adviser to the President of the United States, Ambassador Michael McFaul, who is the coordinator of the international expert group, said that foreign experts will provide comments and suggestions shortly. During the meeting the parties also heard a report by White House National Security Council member Peter Harrell, who focused on the political dimension of sanctions."

"Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Riigikogu, Estonian Parliament",2022-04-13T14:12:00Z,"Dear Mr. Speaker! Dear Mrs. Prime Minister! Members of the Government! Dear deputies of the Riigikogu! The people of Estonia! Thank you for the opportunity to address you today. In circumstances that take us all back to the darkest times of the 20th century. For thirty years, the nations of Europe have enjoyed peace, freedom and shared opportunities for development. Now, Russian revanchism has destroyed all the good that has worked for decades for peace in Europe, for the stability of life of European nations. Only fragments of the global security architecture are left. The same ruins as from Ukrainian cities bombed by Russian missiles and aircraft. All the international institutions that are supposed to support peace - the UN, the OSCE and others - are not able to stop Russia's aggression right now. Although this is what they were created for. Regional alliances, and above all NATO, have faced a difficult reality when no one can be 100% sure whether they will really protect their members in the event of a large-scale Russian attack. The same as the attack on Ukraine. Or in the event of an even worse attack - with the use of weapons of mass destruction. For the first time in many years, the threat of Russia's use of chemical or even nuclear weapons has to be taken seriously. Russian state propagandists, clearly guided by the relevant ""theme lists"", openly discuss Russia's ability to seize all neighboring European countries. They talk about it not just for the sake of emotions, but systematically accustom the Russian audience to the fact that war against neighbors is supposed to be the norm. Russia's attempt to seize all of Ukraine after 8 years of war in Donbas has brought back to European reality what your people had to go through. Mass deportations, filtration camps, a consistent attempt to destroy all those who support the national idea. Today, more than 500,000 Ukrainians have been forcibly displaced. Just imagine how much it is! This is as if the occupiers set, sorry for the example, the goal of deporting all people from Tallinn. The whole city - it was and now there is no one. A third of all your citizens. Deported Ukrainians are deprived of documents. Their phones are being confiscated. They are trying to take these people to remote regions of the Russian Federation. Attempts to return to Ukraine are being hindered in every possible way. Children are separated from their parents and there are attempts of their illegal adoption in Russian families... Tens of thousands of people have already been killed in Ukrainian cities affected by Russian strikes. The Russian army uses all kinds of artillery, all kinds of missiles and air bombs against residential areas and civilian infrastructure. In particular, phosphorus bombs and other munitions prohibited by international law. This is an obvious terror against the civilian population. It is an attempt to break the morale of the people, to subdue Ukrainians for generations or simply to destroy them. Why does the Russian leadership allow themselves all this? What ensures a sense of impunity for Moscow? I'm sure you know the answer to these questions. It is obvious. On the one hand, Russia enjoys its privileges in international structures. In particular, the seat occupied by it as a permanent member of the UN Security Council to block any attempts to actually return peace to Europe or other regions where Russia wages a war. Exactly Russia. On the other hand, the Russian leadership absolutely does not believe that Europe can bring Russia to justice. Moscow simply does not believe that Europe can force Russia into peace. They expect a split among Europeans and that the priority of maintaining trade for Europeans will be higher than the priority of security or even the priority of survival of Russia's neighboring nations. Ladies and Gentlemen! The people of Estonia! This is the time when we can either stop Russia or lose the whole of Eastern Europe for a very long time. Lose any hope for a safe and free life on the continent governed by universally recognized law not by force. And I thank you for understanding that. A crowded rally on February 26 with the participation of tens of thousands of Estonians in the heart of ancient Tallinn on Vabaduse Square in support of Ukraine and in support of freedom in Europe has already become a glorious page of our common history. Estonia was one of the first to provide Ukraine with the necessary assistance, this is true, including defensive aid. I am grateful to you for the sincere support of our migrants. You have been and remain exemplary in your consideration of the issues of Russia's war against Ukraine and the relevant sanctions policy in European and other international structures. I am grateful to you for abandoning Russian energy. The source of dollars and euros paid to Russia for oil and gas, which makes it self-confident and unwilling to seek equal relations with other nations. But we all need to do much more to stop Europe's immersion in the evil that the continent saw in the 1940s! In the same occupation that your country, by the way, went through as well. The black pages of history should not be repeated when deported Ukrainians and Estonians remained for many years in Siberia or the Russian Far East. There are already more than enough Ukrainian and Estonian graves - graves of those who died from communist deportations. That is why I urge you at the level of the European Union to find such instruments of influence on Russia, such instruments of pressure that could stop deportations and return all deported people home. The European Union has the power to ensure this. The European Union must use this power. Until Russia returns forcibly deported Ukrainians, until it returns thousands of abducted children, it must not receive any money from European states or companies. The European Union has no right to sponsor deportations. The European Union has no right to sponsor war. The policy of sanctions against the Russian Federation needs to be taken even more seriously. Why are sanctions necessary? Because this is the only tool to force Russia into peace. I urge you to defend the need for a complete blockade of Russian banks when approving a new, very important package of sanctions against the Russian Federation at the EU level. All banks, not just part of them. I urge you to finally add oil to the sanctions package. An embargo is needed at the level of the entire European Union! I also invite your state and your specialists to join the work of the joint group set up to investigate the war crimes of the Russian army on the territory of independent Ukraine. Technical and expert support is indispensable now as the number of war crimes already reaches tens of thousands. These are executions of civilians, torture, rape, blowing up hospitals, bombing maternity hospitals, burning food warehouses, artillery shelling of shelters in which children are hiding, and they knew about it - I emphasize that once again... There is no crime that Russian soldiers have not committed in the 49 days of this invasion. We will definitely investigate all these war crimes, identify all the culprits and find them. No matter how long it will take. But if we do it together with you, together with other European countries, we will be able to do it much faster. Keep in mind that most of Stalin's torturers didn't bear responsibility for everything they did. Therefore, it is especially important to bring to justice a new generation of Russian executioners. And this must be done now - for what they have done in Ukraine. So that they do not have to be searched for war crimes against the Baltic nations, against Finland, Poland or any other country. All those who have already gained freedom in the 20th century must preserve it in the 21st century. Ukraine will always be grateful to Estonia for the principled support of our state in European integration. I am grateful to you for realizing that Ukraine's accession to the European Union is not just a question of economics or some abstract policy. It is a question of security and guarantees for the preservation of freedom and democracy in Central and Eastern Europe. Ukraine must receive the status of a candidate for EU membership in the near future. We must think about the post-war reconstruction of our country already now. When Russia loses, and this will inevitably happen, it will be necessary to prove to Russia and all other potential revanchists in the world that the war will not lead to the realization of their plans. We are already cooperating with your country in the field of digitization, we are already demonstrating to other European countries the advantages of modern digital systems, including in public administration. After the war, it will become even more relevant, I'm sure. For restoring the normal functioning of state institutions and local authorities. For the return of companies. For the cyber defense of Ukraine and the whole, I repeat - the whole of Europe. Ladies and Gentlemen! The people of Estonia! The Presidents of the three Baltic states and the President of Poland will arrive in Kyiv in a few hours. I look forward to meeting them, to meeting your President, Mr. Alar Karis. Such visits to the capital of our state are especially important now. They are important not only for us, not only as evidence of European support for our struggle for freedom. But also as evidence that all European defenders of freedom will continue to be united. Without any political or economic ""bows"" to Russia. Europeans must make every effort to restore international law immediately. To immediately force Russia to seek peace. This task can only be done jointly by everyone in Europe. At the level of the whole European Union. Together with other members of our anti-war coalition. If Europe wastes time, Russia will use it to expand the war zone to other countries. I believe that together we will never allow this. Thank you, Estonia! Glory to Ukraine!"
The future of Ukraine directly depends on the strength of our resistance in all its forms - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-04-13T00:36:00Z,"Unbreakable people of the bravest country! Do you remember how Russia bragged that they would seize Kyiv in 48 hours? Instead, Ukraine has been repelling the enemy for 48 days. Today it is worth remembering. It is worth remembering that the Russian leadership expected to see the parade of occupiers on Khreschatyk a few days after February 24, after the beginning of the invasion. Instead they see orderly ranks of occupiers every day, whom our defenders send to hell. In 48 hours, which stretched for 48 days, the Russian army has reached a level of irreparable losses higher than that of the Soviet Union in 10 years of war in Afghanistan. Higher than that of Russia in the two wars in Chechnya. The general list of ""two hundred"" for Russia will soon reach 20,000. Literally in a few days, if not tonight. And then what? 30 thousand killed? 40 thousand? Today in Russia it was once again stated that their so-called ""special operation"" is supposedly going according to the plan. But, to be honest, no one in the world understands how such a plan could even emerge. How could a plan providing for the death of tens of thousands of your own soldiers in a little more than a month of war emerge? Who could approve such a plan? And what is the final level of their own losses acceptable for this person? Dozens or even hundreds of thousands of dead Russians? Obviously, no one in Moscow cares about the number of Ukrainian civilians killed. They say they do everything for the sake of the people, for the sake of Donbas... But even during World War II, Donbas did not see such cruelty in such a short time. And from whom? From Russian troops. In Donbas, the story of the siege of Leningrad was repeated. What for? What would the people who died or almost died in Leningrad during the Nazi blockade say about this? What would they say about the blockade of Mariupol? It was also stated in Russia today that the massacre committed by the Russian military in Bucha was allegedly a ""staging"". For some reason, the massacres in Borodyanka, Hostomel, Makariv, cities and villages of the Chernihiv region, Kharkiv region and Donbas have not been commented on yet. There are not as many ""specialists in staging"" in the world as there are murderers in the Russian army. Responsibility for war crimes is inevitable. As an example, I can mention today's result of the Security Service of Ukraine. It is very symbolic that Mr. Medvedchuk was detained on Cosmonautics Day. He has been hiding for 48 days. And finally decided to try to escape from our country. Well, for this ""astronaut"" - in the bad sense of the word - the famous ""Let's go!"" did not work. I think it is especially cynical of him to use military camouflage. He tried to disguise himself like that. Such a ""soldier"". Such a ""patriot"". Well, if Medvedchuk chose a military uniform for himself, he falls under the rules of wartime. I offer the Russian Federation to exchange this guy of yours for our boys and our girls who are now in Russian captivity. It is therefore important that our law enforcement officials and military also consider this possibility. There are more and more testimonies and other official data of the investigation about the horrible crimes of the occupiers in the areas where they managed, unfortunately, to come. About the inhuman cruelty of the Russian military towards women and children. About numerous rapes. Not all serial rapists reached the level of brutality of Russian soldiers. Of course, we will establish the full truth about all these savages. No matter how much time and effort it takes, we will find them all. And let Medvedchuk be an example for you. Even the former oligarch did not escape, not to mention much more ordinary criminals from the Russian boondocks. We will get everyone. We take with great attention yesterday's reports on the use of a projectile with a poisonous substance in Mariupol against the defenders of the city. It is not yet possible to draw one hundred percent conclusions about what kind of substance it was. Obviously it is impossible to conduct a full investigation and full analysis in the besieged city. However, given the repeated threats of Russian propagandists to use chemical weapons against the defenders of Mariupol and the repeated use by the Russian army of phosphorus munitions in Ukraine for example, the world must respond now. Respond preventively. Because after the use of weapons of mass destruction, any response will not change anything. And it will only look like a humiliation for the democratic world. Today, in my address to the parliament and the people of Lithuania, and at the same time to all European nations, I stressed that the sixth package of EU sanctions against Russia must include oil. Stop multiplying insufficiently strong sanctions packages. In any case, you will have to acknowledge that only Europe's abandonment of Russia's energy resources and the complete restriction of Russia's banking system can be an argument for Russia's leadership to seek peace. Without this, Moscow is looking for a military solution. I also spoke today with Chancellor of Austria Nehammer who had met with the Russian leader the day before. We exchanged details about this meeting. Many people like to mock the occupiers, troll their failures, the level of training of their soldiers and the questionable quality of the ""latest"" Russian equipment, which has been developed over the past 20 years and is inferior to Soviet models. And rightly so. That's fair. But at the same time, we must understand that not all Russian tanks are stalled in the field. Not all enemy soldiers simply flee the battlefield. And not all of them are conscripts who do not know how to hold weapons properly. This does not mean we should be afraid of them. This means we must not belittle the merits of our soldiers, our army. And I want to thank them again, all our defenders. I don't get tired of doing it. And I want you and I not to tire of telling them the most important thing: we believe in you. We are proud of you. We admire you. We are also proud of all our people who take to the streets despite the occupation. Who are protesting. Who are expelling the occupiers as best they can. We are proud of all our people! That is why it should always be emphasized that if our cities and villages are occupied, it is only temporary. And they will definitely be liberated. They will be liberated by our heroes. And not only by force of arms, but also by force of morale. Morale demonstrated almost daily by Ukrainian men and women in the cities and villages of the south of our country. In the areas that Russian troops have temporarily occupied and which our army has not yet liberated. No matter what, you need to resist the occupiers. It's hard, I know. You have to fight. Protest. Defend our national statehood. And it is necessary to punish collaborators. Let them make ""KhNR"" somewhere in Khakassia, not in our native Ukrainian Kherson. The future of Ukraine directly depends on the strength of our resistance in all its forms. The future of us all, each of our cities, each of our villages. And I am grateful to everyone who understands this. Who does not stop resisting even when it seems that the result is very far. Because the darkest time is always before dawn. And today I want to separately address those heroes who are having a very hard time. Those who defend Mariupol. Marine battalion of the 36th marine brigade, Azov special operations detachment, 12th operational brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine. Subdivisions of the State Border Guard Service. Volunteers of the ""Right Sector"". 555th military hospital and National Police employees. All the military who are fighting in the JFO area, who are defending Kharkiv, the Kharkiv region, all the military groups defending the Zaporizhzhia region, defending the south. Special thanks to the 92nd, 93rd, 95th brigades. Personally to General Nayev. I am infinitely grateful to everyone! On behalf of all Ukrainians. A few minutes ago I signed three decrees. 419 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 72 of them posthumously. Also, 30 servicemen of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine were awarded state awards. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Lieutenant Colonel Dmytro Mykolayovych Vasyliyev, commander of the missile division of the 19th missile brigade. Posthumously. Eternal glory to all our heroes! Eternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine! Inevitable punishment to all our enemies. Glory to Ukraine!"
Address of the President to the Parliament of Lithuania,2022-04-12T13:22:00Z,"Dear Mrs. Speaker, Mrs. Viktorija, I remember your visit to Kyiv, one of the first since the beginning of this war. Dear Mr. President, friend Gitanas, you have been to Ukraine many times, you and I have done a lot together. I'm sure we will do even more! Dear Mrs. Prime Minister, Mrs. Ingrida, I am grateful to you for your visit yesterday... Dear Lithuanian people! I am grateful for the opportunity to address you today on behalf of the entire Ukrainian people, who will always remember your sincerity and readiness to support us at the most difficult time for our country. You were among the first to come to the aid of Ukraine. And you remain among those who care most about peace and security of Europe. Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine has posed a strategic question to Europe: are the values that underlie the unification of nations on the European continent after World War II still alive? Or the values have already played their part and can become exhibits in museums for tourists? Just part of Europe's historical heritage somewhere in the halls of ancient palaces, not something that defines real life. Unfortunately, there is no common answer to this question for all Europeans. But the future of Europe depends on this - whether there will be a common answer. In the liberated areas of Ukraine, work continues to record and investigate war crimes committed by the Russian Federation. Almost every day new mass graves are found. Evidence is being gathered. Thousands and thousands of victims. Hundreds of cases of brutal torture. Human corpses are still found in manholes and basements. Tied up, mutilated bodies. There are villages - once quite large, which were left almost without inhabitants. Hundreds of children are orphans. That is, at least hundreds of children, because we do not know the exact number of victims yet. Hundreds of cases of rape have been recorded, including underage girls, very young children... And even a baby! It's just scary to talk about it now. But it's true, it happened. Even this person, this Russian savage Bychkov from Pskov is identified. The paratrooper or special services officer who sent this video to his comrades. Video of what he does to the baby. How he torments the baby! This is the Russian military. ""Defender"" of children. This is a ""special operation"" planned in Moscow. This is the story of the struggle for the ""Russian world"". This is what the Russian army and Russian paratroopers will now be associated with. From Pskov. Rape of a baby… Russian propagandists have apparently already begun to justify this. They will probably say, as always, that this did not happen, or even if it did happen, it was the protection of ""Russian-speakers."" And propagandists will also be responsible for this crime, as well as for any such crime. Including those who educate such paratroopers. From Pskov. And including those in Europe who still do not remove Russian propaganda from television. And I wonder how do the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation and other authors of this ""special operation"" evaluate its results now? After such crimes. After such a ""feat"" of the Russian soldier Bychkov? Maybe the Russian Minister of Defense will invite such Pskov paratroopers to his home to protect his children and grandchildren? Or the minister wouldn't want that? I'm sure he'll be scared. Everywhere in Ukraine where the occupiers came, along the roads, in yards, parks, gardens, there is a burial of people whose bodies could not be taken to cemeteries. And all this is within a period of several weeks of Russian occupation. About a month. In the areas around our capital, in the Chernihiv and Sumy regions, in the north of our state. The whole world remembered the name of the city of Bucha. But this is just one symbol of the crimes of the Russian military. You can take any other city from those where they managed to gain a foothold for a while, any village... The occupiers did the same thing there as in Bucha. And what is in the east of our country, where Russian troops still remain? What is in the south? We cannot even imagine what is in Mariupol and Volnovakha, which were almost destroyed by the Russian army. Obviously, it's even scarier there. Russian officials and state propagandists deny crimes committed by their army. They say it's a staging. They lie in response to even the obvious facts that convince everyone in the world. However, no wonder. They always did it. But they have changed their tactics in areas where the Russian troops still remain. Corpses are no longer left on the streets there. They are taken out and probably burned. There are mass deportations of people from the occupied areas. Hundreds of thousands of people have already been deported. They are placed in special filtration camps. Documents are taken away from them. They are interrogated and humiliated. It is unknown how many are killed. Many deportees are distributed in the regions of Russia and banned from leaving. Obviously, all this is an attempt to get rid of witnesses to Russian war crimes in Ukraine. Is it possible that the Russian military has done and is doing so without orders from the high command? Impossible. Is it possible that the Russian political leadership is not aware of the consequences of such orders? Impossible. But this is happening on our Ukrainian land. Why? The answer is very cynical. They are confident of impunity. They are sure that they will be able to make the world forget it. They are sure Europe will forget this or Europe's claims can simply be brushed aside. They have a simple, ordinary logic. Like, everyone needs to trade. Everyone needs oil. Everyone needs gas. Everyone will want to use Russian territory for the transit of their goods. Everyone will want to use the Russian market, the big market. That's what Moscow thinks. Of course, if everyone in Europe were as principled and respected the values of Europe as you do in Lithuania, and we are proud of you, I am sure that the Russian leadership would not hope that they would go unpunished. Probably, this war would not have begun. They would not have dared to make a decision to start it. But what do we see? The European Union is discussing the sixth - I emphasize: the sixth package of sanctions against Russia for the war unprecedented since World War II, and it is still unknown whether oil will be subject to sanctions. Even after seeing massacres in Bucha and other cities, even knowing about the deportations of people, even watching the deliberate destruction of peaceful cities by Russian missiles and air bombs - some EU countries cannot decide when they will at least significantly limit the purchase of Russian energy. Hundreds of European companies and banks have not only not yet refused to operate in the Russian market, but are also showing outright contempt in response to demands to stop financing Russia's military machine through their taxes and excise taxes. And all this is happening right now - when the blood is still fresh. What does this indicate? If oil is being seriously discussed only for the sixth package of sanctions, then the world does not realize what war Russia was preparing for. If there is still no clear decision on Russian gas, there can be no certainty that Europe has a common will to stop Russian war crimes. To force Russia to seek peace. If there are large European companies and large European banks, which even in the midst of hostilities in Ukraine do not consider it necessary to withdraw from the Russian market, it means that all other companies will take this as a signal: wait, wait a bit and then you can work as usual, even if nothing changes significantly in Russia's behavior. Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear Lithuanian people! I am grateful to you for the leadership. For being the first to abandon Russian energy now. When it is really necessary. I am grateful to you, Gitanas, for the important decision. For being the first to give us real help, to give us weapons. Stingers and more. It was a historic manifestation of leadership. After all, the Lithuanian people, like no other, understand how the occupiers can destroy freedom and at what cost the independence is rebuilt then, which you have done exemplary. This is exactly the kind of leadership the whole continent needs now to truly save and uphold common values that are undoubtedly important for Europe. To prove that the common values of freedom, human rights, respect for state borders and prevention of a war of invasion are in fact alive, not something outdated and worthy of a museum only. When the continent thought primarily of selfish interests, rather than of what should unite everyone, this has always led to terrible times for Europe as a whole. Discord, outbreaks of revanchism, wars - this is definitely not what Europeans need in the 21st century. But this is what Russia is trying to bring back. The Russian state must be responsible for this war. Russian officials and military commanders, all those guilty of war crimes, must be held accountable. All organizers and perpetrators of deportation must be held accountable. Russia must be deprived of any opportunity to terrorize its neighbors. It's not just about us, it's not just about Ukraine! The real Russian plans are obvious to everyone. Ukraine is just the beginning. Next, God forbid, but next is your state, other Baltic states, Moldova, Georgia, Poland, Central Asian states. Threats are already being heard from Moscow against Finland and Sweden. How will Europe be able to stop Russia's further expansion if it is not yet able to stop even what is happening in Ukraine now? Although I know that Lithuania is already doing everything one hundred percent to protect Europe's values, freedom and security for Europeans, it is important that the whole of Europe works one hundred percent. Every effort must be made to ensure that Europe's response to Russian aggression is truly strong and truly consolidated. We cannot wait for the elaboration of the seventh or eighth or ninth, tenth, twentieth package of sanctions against Russia in order to make really powerful decisions. We must do everything necessary now - in the sixth package of sanctions. The European Union can do that. And it must do that. It must include oil there. It must impose sanctions on Russian banks - on all of them, not part. No demonstrations needed. Specific deadlines must finally be set for each EU state in order to really abandon or at least significantly limit the consumption of Russian gas, oil, etc. Only then will the Russian leadership come to the conclusion that real peace must be sought. That war is a catastrophe first of all for them. We have already achieved a lot at the bilateral level. True understanding. True allied relations based not just on interests, but on values and on our common historical path. We will only strengthen our cooperation in the original format of the Lublin Triangle. This will definitely be the basis for a new security configuration in the Baltic-Black Sea region. Ukraine is also grateful to all our friends in the European Union for starting the accelerated procedure for our country to obtain the status of a candidate for EU membership. We are especially grateful to the Republic of Lithuania. Successfully completing the procedure in the near future is also a must to show Russia that the war will not break either you or the whole of Europe. And when peace finally comes - and I am sure it will come very soon if everyone in Europe is truly principled - we will be able to quickly and demonstratively rebuild Ukraine after this war. I invite your society, your companies, your state to join the project of reconstruction of Ukraine. The reconstruction, which will be the most convincing argument for all those who still have doubts about Europe. About its future. About its potential. Life must win the war. Values must win the war. Europe must win the war. And we will win. I am grateful to each of you! I am grateful to the Lithuanian people! Glory to Ukraine!"
The new package of sanctions should be such that Russia does not even talk about weapons of mass destruction - address by the President of Ukraine,2022-04-12T00:07:00Z,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! The 47th day of the Russian-Ukrainian war, this shameful invasion that is gradually wiping Russia out of international relations, is coming to an end. Invasion that makes it more and more toxic every day. Now it is only a matter of time before the Russian army with its own actions and war crimes forces everyone in the world to renounce all ties with the Russian Federation. Security work is underway in the northern regions of our country, from where the occupiers were expelled. First of all, it is mine clearance. Russian troops left behind tens if not hundreds of thousands of dangerous objects. These are shells that did not explode, mines, tripwire mines. At least several thousand such items are disposed of daily. The occupiers left mines everywhere. In the houses they seized. Just on the streets, in the fields. They mined people's property, mined cars, doors. They consciously did everything to make the return to these areas after deoccupation as dangerous as possible. Due to the actions of the Russian army, our territory is currently one of the most contaminated by mines in the world. And I believe this should also be considered as a war crime of Russian troops. They deliberately did everything to kill or maim as many of our people as possible, even when they were forced to withdraw from our land. Without the appropriate orders, they would not have done it. This afternoon I met on Bankova Street with an expert group working on the creation of a special mechanism for pre-trial investigation and judicial review of all war crimes committed by the occupiers. We are working on a legal way to bring the occupiers to justice, which will be as effective and as fast as possible. In order not to wait for decades until all international legal procedures are completed, but to accelerate the onset of justice. I expect that the options for creating such a special mechanism will be presented in the near future. Today, the occupiers issued a new statement, which testifies to their preparation for a new stage of terror against Ukraine and our defenders. One of the mouthpieces of the occupiers stated that they could use chemical weapons against the defenders of Mariupol. We take this as seriously as possible. I want to remind the world leaders that the possible use of chemical weapons by the Russian military has already been discussed. And already at that time it meant that it was necessary to react to the Russian aggression much tougher and faster. The European Union has now begun discussing a sixth package of sanctions against Russia. It is time to make this package such that even a word about weapons of mass destruction is no longer heard from the Russian side. An oil embargo against Russia is mandatory. Any new package of sanctions against Russia that does not affect oil will be received in Moscow with a smile. I spoke about the need to strengthen sanctions against Russia in my address to the parliament and people of the Republic of Korea. This week I will continue this format of communication with partner countries. Tomorrow I will address the parliament and the people of the Republic of Lithuania. By the way, Prime Minister of Lithuania Ingrida Šimonytė paid a visit to Ukraine today. I am grateful to her for the support, as well as to all the Lithuanian people. The issue of punishing all those guilty of crimes against Ukrainians was also discussed today with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. The second important topic of our conversation was the strengthening of sanctions against Russia. We will continue to coordinate our steps to force the Russian Federation to seek peace. I also discussed cooperation in the energy sphere with the Prime Minister of Norway. Expressed gratitude for the support of efforts aimed to force Russia to seek peace. I also held talks with the Chairperson of the African Union, President of Senegal. Informed him about the current situation in Ukraine, about the global threats posed by the Russian invasion. The key task both today and every day at this time is concrete defensive measures. A concrete increase in our ability to repel any attacks by Russian troops. I am dealing with this issue almost around the clock. I'm sure people see it, too. Just as they see that the military and technical capabilities of the enemy are still very high. Yes, Ukrainians are incomparably braver. Our Armed Forces are beating the occupiers with wisdom and well-thought-out tactics inaccessible to the Russian military. But when it comes to the necessary weapons, we still depend on the supply, on our partners. Unfortunately, we are not getting as much as we need to end this war sooner. To completely destroy the enemy on our land. And to fulfill those tasks that are obvious to each of our people. In particular, to unblock Mariupol. If we got jets and enough heavy armored vehicles, the necessary artillery, we would be able to do it. But... We still have to agree on this. We still have to persuade. We still have to squeeze out the necessary decisions. I am sure that we will get almost everything we need. But not only time is being lost. The lives of Ukrainians are being lost. Lives that can no longer be returned. And this is also the responsibility of those who still keep the weapons Ukraine needs in their armory. The responsibility that will forever remain in history. Just as our gratitude will remain in history. Gratitude to those states and politicians who really helped. Who did not waste time. Who didn't bargain when life depended on help. I also signed several important decrees. 187 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 15 servicemen of the National Guard of Ukraine and 6 servicemen of the Main Intelligence Directorate were awarded. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to 5 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in particular to 2 colonels of the medical service: Ivchuk Viktor Mykhailovych - thanks to his actions more than a hundred lives were saved in Mariupol. Both of the military and civilians. Slesarenko Oleksandr Petrovych - thanks to his actions in the city of Chernihiv, medical care was provided to more than 450 servicemen and more than 600 civilians. I am grateful to all our heroes! Glory to everyone who defends Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
"If Ukraine receives the necessary weapons in time, it will win - Andriy Yermak",2022-04-11T18:37:00Z,"Ukraine will be able to repel the armed aggression of the Russian Federation if we are provided with the necessary weapons as soon as possible. This was emphasized by Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak in an interview for 60 Minutes on CBS. According to him, first of all Ukraine needs heavy weapons, in particular artillery. ""Secondly, we need tanks, military aircraft. We need all possible weapons that will help close the Ukrainian sky,"" Andriy Yermak said. The Head of the Office of the President noted that he has a profound and detailed dialogue with the American side, and stressed that US President Joseph Biden ""has done more for Ukraine than anyone else."" ""But when you're at war - we talk about it openly - you need more. And even that is not enough - we need everything as soon as possible. If we have it in time, we will win,"" Andriy Yermak said."
"Ukraine has become a symbol of freedom, the center of Europe where the struggle between good and evil is now concentrated - Mykhailo Podolyak",2022-04-11T17:28:00Z,"After Europe and the world saw the horrific crimes committed by Russian troops against civilians in the Kyiv and Donetsk regions, they began to help Ukraine more decisively to repel Russia's armed aggression. Mykhailo Podolyak, Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine said this in an interview for the host of the TV channel ""Ukraine 24"" Tygran Martyrosyan. ""In my opinion, the emotional component has already started working. Significantly. Especially after Bucha, Kramatorsk, etc. If in the beginning European countries perceived the war as a war of armies - they said that, of course, we will help with something, because Russia is much bigger than Ukraine - then after this emotional overstrain that took place in the Kyiv region and then in Kramatorsk, when people who were preparing for the evacuation were deliberately bombed, it will move Europe to even more radical action against Russia,"" said Mykhailo Podolyak. The Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President noted that long before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Europe tried to pretend not to notice the threats and to preserve its usual way of life. But Russia's treacherous, unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has forced all countries to reconsider their positions: some have taken the lead, and some have remained in the shadows. Mykhailo Podolyak noted that, unfortunately, even today in some European countries there are pro-Russian sentiments, but Russia will never be a civilized state again according to moral and ethical grounds. ""You have to accept this, you have to minimize contacts with it at all levels,"" Mykhailo Podolyak urged the world. According to him, if Ukraine does not stop Russia now, Russia's expansion will spread around the world. ""Russia, which violates global rules, will continue to invest in all kinds of terrorist organizations, and the whole European security will be threatened. Because everyone will understand that it is possible to create arbitrariness and wage wars violating the rules of war - rape people, burn them, make videos of it and show it on TV, brag about it. That's what will happen,"" he said. Therefore, according to the Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President, Europeans must decide for themselves - to lose 1.5% of GDP today, pay a little more for utilities and lower living standards but stop the horde and return predictability to European security. At the same time, Mykhailo Podolyak emphasized: Ukraine does not call on Europe to send its soldiers to fight alongside Ukrainians and no longer asks to close the skies. It urges to provide equipment, heavy artillery and air defense equipment. ""Give it to us, and then we, Ukrainians, will deal with it ourselves. In particular, with the Russians. And we will defend Europe in the end. And then we will count who owes what to whom and why we paid for it with so many lives of our citizens,"" he said and thanked those who already have the right, pro-Ukrainian position. The Adviser to the Head of the President's Office is convinced that the war has shown that Ukraine is a country with a strong leadership spirit. ""A country with a really strong leadership spirit has emerged in the heart of Europe, with a strong-willed President who undertakes a more global responsibility, who offers the world to reconsider security formulas,"" said Mykhailo Podolyak, adding that yesterday there were many who thought that Ukraine was a provincial country with a weak economy. He also said that the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Head of the Office of the President, the Prime Minister, the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada and ministers also proved that they can withstand the hits. According to the Adviser to the Head of the President's Office, Europe and the world have begun to recognize the power of Ukraine and talk to us on an equal footing - as a country that has proven its high morale. He called the visit of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to Kyiv an example, which demonstrates the solidarity of the two nations. By his actions, Boris Johnson showed that one can be a brave politician. ""This is a symbol of the fact that Ukraine will not lose, because no one comes to those who potentially lose. And the example of Russia proves it,"" Mykhailo Podolyak said. He also stated that many leaders are already visiting our country, thus expressing solidarity with Ukraine and demonstrating faith in its victory, understanding of how rotten modern Russia is and showing that it is unacceptable for them. They also provide practical assistance. The United Kingdom is the leader in this regard - in moderating processes and intensifying assistance, combining all programs. ""It seems to me that any visit today - and there are many of them now - emphasizes that Ukraine has become a symbol of freedom, the center of a free Europe, and that the struggle between good and evil, values of freedom and values of the totalitarian regime is concentrated here no matter how pompous it sounds. That is why everyone who comes here expresses solidarity not only with Ukraine, but also with the fact that the values of freedom, democracy, choice, competition are really important for them,” the Adviser to the Head of the President's Office summed up."
Mykhailo Podolyak: Ukraine's position in negotiations with Russia will depend on success on the frontline,2022-04-11T15:47:00Z,"In negotiations with the Russian Federation, Ukraine will do its utmost to end the war taking into account its national interests and to obtain reliable international guarantees to prevent such wars in the future. This was stated by Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Mykhailo Podolyak in an interview for the host of the TV channel ""Ukraine 24"" Tygran Martyrosyan. ""We have the Istanbul Communiqué, which clearly spells out Ukraine's position. It is unchanged. We want to get a formulaic solution: both the possibility of ending the war and preventing similar wars in the future. Because today's situation has shown that Ukraine is left alone with an expansionist empire that invests a lot of money in military technology. And if it remains more or less in its current form, in a year or two it will invade someone's territory again,"" Mykhailo Podolyak said. According to him, even when the aggressor continues to attack Ukrainian cities, negotiations must be held, because our state must use all the tools to end the war on its own terms and with the least losses among the civilian population. At the same time, Mykhailo Podolyak reiterated that issues related to territorial integrity and sovereignty remain inviolable for Ukraine. The Adviser to the Head of the President's Office noted that Ukraine's goal is not a bilateral peace agreement with Russia, which will not fulfill it, but multilateral security guarantees that will prevent a repeat of such a war against our state. ""We want to have a specific formula that Ukraine is sitting at the negotiating table, the aggressor country - the Russian Federation is sitting at the negotiating table, and next to Ukraine are the countries that will guarantee Russia's commitment not to attack,"" he explained. Mykhailo Podolyak noted that due to the imposed international sanctions, negative protest sentiments are already growing in Russia, and that is why the Russian authorities are forced to enter into negotiations to fix a certain current position. But the longer it delays the process, the higher the price will be for it. According to him, Russia is now concentrating on the eastern direction - Kharkiv, Donetsk, Luhansk - to prove to the world that it still knows how to fight. ""Because today, on the 47th day of the war, it proved to the world that it can't fight - it can only stab,"" Mykhailo Podolyak is convinced. He noted that the Ukrainian army is ready to fight the occupiers. ""Either we or they have to gain a significant advantage on the battlefield. Only after that our positions in the negotiating group will be significantly strengthened and, of course, we will get what Ukraine needs. The negotiating team will definitely not work contrary to what is happening on the battlefield and certainly not against the way President Zelenskyy sees the whole situation, and he sees it much more clearly,"" said the Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President. In view of this, as Mykhailo Podolyak noted, it is worth waiting for the situation in eastern Ukraine to unfold in the coming weeks. ""And if we can prove once again that the Russian army is a rudiment, a useless institution, then we will have a great opportunity to prove that Russia as a state must stop dictating any conditions in the world,"" said the Adviser to the Head of the President's Office."
Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with an expert group on the creation of a special international mechanism of justice,2022-04-11T15:03:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with an expert group working on the issue of creating a special mechanism for the judicial review and pre-trial investigation of all war crimes committed by Russian aggressors on the territory of Ukraine. This group includes: the Head of the President's Office, his deputies, profile ministers and chairpersons of parliamentary committees, the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, the Chairman of the Supreme Court, and the chairpersons of courts of cassation. At the beginning of the meeting, Deputy Head of the Office of the President Andriy Smyrnov reported on the readiness of the Office of the President together with relevant ministries to present a model of creating special international instruments for prosecuting Russia's crimes against Ukraine and a mechanism of compensations for the victims. These models are ready for further discussion with Ukraine's international partners. During the meeting, the participants discussed the establishment of a special international military tribunal, which could provide a legal assessment of the evidence of Russia's aggression against Ukraine, which is obvious. It was emphasized that the establishment of such a mechanism in no way prejudices the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, from which Ukraine expects decisions on crimes of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The parties also discussed the issue of creating a special mechanism in the form of arbitration regarding compensation for the losses caused by Russia's aggression to Ukraine."
Speech by the President of Ukraine in the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea,2022-04-11T13:22:00Z,"Dear Mr. Speaker. Dear deputies of the National Assembly, Ladies and Gentlemen, Korean people! I am grateful for this opportunity to address you on behalf of the whole of Ukraine, which has been opposing the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation for 47 days already. Russia attacked us. Attacked, taking advantage of its military force. This state has spent decades preparing for this war. Decades and enormous resources. Financial resources - hundreds of billions of dollars received for the export of oil and gas and used for the production and accumulation of weapons. As well as human resources. Already about 2,000 missiles have been fired at our cities by Russia. Artillery shells are simply impossible to count. But the worst thing is how Russia uses people to prepare and wage war. For the people of Russia such conditions are deliberately created when they are forced to live in total, utter poverty. When they can't afford even the simplest things - normal food, ordinary household appliances, normal education. When they do not have even basic human rights guarantees throughout their lives. And when service in the army for many of them becomes the only, so to speak, social mobility option. Opportunity to get at least something in life. At least somehow try to fend for oneself. When they got to the war and entered the territory of a neighboring state, tens of thousands of Russian servicemen were simply shocked by the normality of life. They were shocked by cities and villages where people were not in need. Shocked by home appliances in houses. Shocked that people had normal food. A significant number of occupiers simply have never seen such a thing in their lives. Almost immediately, Russian troops started looting in the territory of Ukraine - in those areas that they managed to invade. They tried to take home to Russia everything of any value. From washing machines to computers. From auto parts to clothes. They just stuffed armored personnel carriers, trucks, stole cars and tried to take out the loot. You know, there were cases when Russian soldiers took protective plates from their bulletproof vests to hide stolen laptops and tablets in bulletproof vests. It is impossible to believe - when a person is so poor from birth that he thinks that a laptop is more valuable than his own life in the war. But this is exactly what we saw on our land when the Russian army invaded. It is a collision of two different worlds. The world of ordinary people who just lived a peaceful life, just wanted harmony for themselves and their children, thought about the future. And the world of people who have been specially humiliated by their state for decades, specially driven into poverty and lawlessness, so that their government can send them to any venture. To any war against neighbors. And this is Russia's war not just to conquer Ukraine. This is only the first step. First, Russia wants to destroy our independence, our state, to tear it apart. Wants to destroy everything that makes us Ukrainians, makes us a separate nation. And then it wants to go further to Europe. Further to Asia. In the occupied Ukrainian territory, the Russian military purposefully searched for teachers, any people related to the army and the functioning of the state, activists, journalists. All those who educated and defended the national idea. Such people were abducted. Such people were killed. Deliberately. It was an order, it was a tactic. But Russia has only just begun with Ukraine. The next step in their plan is to destroy other states. Attempt to conquer other neighboring nations. Russia wants to dominate. And it believes that it can do this in only one way: sending its army brought up in total lawlessness to destroy everything that allows other nations to live. With missile and air strikes at our territory, Russia has already destroyed hundreds of infrastructure facilities that ensured normal economic and social life in Ukraine. Russian missiles and aircraft are destroying oil depots, destroying food warehouses, airports, railway stations, manufacturing plants and universities. 938 educational facilities alone have been destroyed. Almost 300 hospitals. This is a deliberate tactic of the Russian troops, not something accidental. They are deliberately destroying residential neighborhoods and entire cities. Using artillery, mortars, tanks. Not one city, not two, not three. These are dozens of cities that the Russian military simply tried to wipe off the face of the earth. Black ruins instead of high-rises. Piles of stone and concrete debris instead of ordinary peaceful cities. We still cannot determine the number of deceased. From the north to the south of the country - in all areas where Russian shells reached, bombs reached - the dismantling of debris is still ongoing. Active hostilities are still going on in part of our territory. Russia is preparing another offensive. Hoping to break our national resistance after all. The occupiers concentrated tens of thousands of soldiers and a huge amount of equipment to try to strike again. The worst situation is in Mariupol, in our southern port city, which has been blocked by Russian troops since March 1. It was a city of half a million. Half a million people. The occupiers blocked it and did not even allow food and water to be brought there. They tried to capture it in the most brutal way - just to destroy everything in the city. Mariupol is destroyed. There are tens of thousands of dead. But even despite this, the Russians do not stop the offensive. They want to make Mariupol a demonstratively destroyed city. Ladies and Gentlemen, Korean people! This could be seen in the 20th century. And you remember that. You know what it's like to defend your land. You remember when in the 1950s you were attacked by those who wanted to destroy your freedom. They destroyed, they killed. What would they have left from your identity if they had succeeded? This is a horrible question. But you withstood, the world helped you. Now we want the same. There is no hope that Russia will simply stop on its own. There is no hope that reason will prevail, and the Russian leadership will simply refuse to continue this war. Russia can only be forced to do so. It can only be forced to seek peace. Forced to stop tormenting people. Forced to respect the independent life of neighboring nations. Forced to leave the territory of Ukraine. Our anti-war coalition, formed after the beginning of this brutal invasion of Russia, has already imposed unprecedented sanctions against it. But these sanctions are not enough. Russia does not yet feel that it must stop. This means that much more needs to be done. And not only at the state level. Russian banks' ties with the global financial system must be severed. It is necessary to limit Russia's exports of energy resources, especially oil. But it is also necessary that world companies stop being sponsors of this barbaric state, which believes that it has the right to destroy the lives of nations. Which believes that it has the right to sow poverty, lawlessness and death around the world. The more companies stop trading with Russia, work in Russia, pay taxes to the Russian state, the faster reason will win. Russia will have to give up militancy and seek compromises with the world. Because it has already come to the point that Russia is openly blackmailing the world with nuclear and chemical weapons! But working strategically, we need to protect people here and now. Protect those directly threatened by the Russian army. For 47 days we have been defending ourselves against virtually the entire Russian army - its most capable units. Our Armed Forces of Ukraine are fighting heroically, very wisely, rationally using available resources and weapons. We receive help from around the world. And I am sincerely grateful to your state, sincerely grateful to your people for their support. But we need much more. To survive in this war against such a prepared adversary as the Russian Federation. Against a state that does not count the dead and has countless stock of military equipment since the days of the Soviet Union… We need air defense systems, aircraft, tanks and other armored vehicles, artillery systems and ammunition. And you have something that can be indispensable for us. You have it. Armored vehicles, anti-aircraft, anti-tank, anti-ship weapons. When it comes to survival in a war aimed at the complete conquest of the people, it is necessary to give principled answers. The usual rules for the supply of weapons must be reviewed and action must be taken quickly. It is necessary to help. Providing the necessary weapons to Ukraine means not only saving the lives of our people, not only giving us the opportunity to unblock our cities, in particular our long-suffering Mariupol, but also saving other states and other regions from further deployment of Russian aggression. Every nation has the right to live independently. Every city has the right to complete security. Every person has the right to freedom and to seek personal happiness. People should not be instruments of some regimes, some dictators. People have the right to just live. That's what we're fighting for. That's what we ask you to defend with us. And that is what we will rebuild - I hope together with you and the whole world - after this war. Ladies and Gentlemen! Korean people! Today in this address I mentioned our Mariupol four times. Our city, which is experiencing the darkest time in its history. Our city, which Russian troops are simply destroying. I would like you to watch one video now. Footage taken by a journalist who endured weeks of Russian blockade in Mariupol. I ask you to see with your own eyes what Ukrainians have been seeing for 47 days. We ask for help to stop this. For the cities of Ukraine and other states to never see such evil again. So that Russia can never come to them again. Please watch this video."
Giving up Russia's bloody oil is a top priority - Oleg Ustenko,2022-04-10T23:54:00Z,"The countries' abandonment of Russian oil will not lead to an increase in world oil prices, even if oil production does not increase significantly, which is unlikely. This was stated by Adviser to the President of Ukraine on economic issues Oleg Ustenko in an online interview for the South Korean media outlet MoneyS. Oleg Ustenko noted that Russia's crude oil exports have been growing steadily since the start of the war in Ukraine, reaching 4.7 million barrels last month, a record high since the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Putin earns $ 1 billion a day from oil alone. European countries have even increased imports of Russian oil,"" he said. The President's adviser pointed out that, for example, Germany now has the largest oil reserves in history and, according to the German Minister of Energy, will continue to import Russian oil. Oleg Ustenko refuted the claim that with the introduction of the embargo on Russian oil, world oil prices will begin to rise significantly. “The Office of the President of Ukraine conducted a simulation under the conditions that additional oil supply would not happen, which is the worst scenario. As a result, we realized that the hike in oil will become normal again, within a few weeks,” he said. “Some European nations are concerned that inflation could happen. However, the market will undergo a rapid correction, and prices will return to acceptable levels. The reason that I believe the oil price will fall is because additional crude oil will be supplied in the market, from Latin America and the Middle East,” the Adviser to the President explained. African countries and some countries in the Middle East have begun to prepare for increased production. It is possible that Iran and Venezuela will enter the world market with the supply of oil. Therefore, according to Oleg Ustenko, abandoning Russia's bloody oil is a top priority. At the same time, he said, Russia will continue to sell its oil at a cheap price, even at half the current international oil price. And even if the West cuts imports significantly in the future, Russian oil could be bought by India and China. However, Russia has limited opportunities to supply its oil, as its tanker fleet is quite small. Therefore, according to the President's Adviser, the world should not help Russia in transporting energy - it should impose sanctions on Russian ports and impose an embargo on the transportation of Russian oil. Oleg Ustenko thanked the United States for imposing an embargo on Russian oil and gas. At the same time, he hopes for additional sanctions, including a secondary boycott of Russian energy. The President's Adviser also thanked Seoul for supporting Ukraine, because, as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently noted, the Republic of Korea sincerely feels the pain of Kyiv. Oleg Ustenko called on the world to block the cash flow for Russian President Vladimir Putin and to stop importing bloody Russian oil and gas."
All our actions and every minute are aimed at forcing Russia to recognize the truth - address by the President of Ukraine,2022-04-10T23:45:00Z,"Ukrainians! The bravest people of the best country in the world! Another week of our struggle for freedom, for the state, is coming to an end. Another week when Ukraine lives despite all Russia's efforts to destroy us. We defend ourselves. Hit back. We develop our relations with partners. We receive help. We ensure the maximum attention of the world to our needs. Influence the global debate. Propose and promote new sanctions against Russia. We are doing everything we can to bring to justice every bastard who came to our land under the Russian flag and killed our people. Who tortured our people. Destroyed our cities. Looted and tormented. And what is Russia doing? What are its officials, its propagandists and ordinary people doing who repeat what they have heard on television? They are only justifying themselves and denying. They are trying to shift the responsibility. They are lying. And they have already lost connection with reality to a degree that they accuse us of committing what Russian troops have obviously done - obviously for everyone in the world. They say about the murders in Bucha that it is not them, but allegedly us. Although it is obvious to everyone that people were killed while the Russian army controlled the city. They say about the missile strike at Kramatorsk that it is not them, but allegedly us. Although it was their propagandists who announced this strike. Although missiles flew from the territory under their control. And about any of our destroyed cities, about any of our burned villages, they say the same thing, that it is not them either, but allegedly us. The Russian militaries have already lied to the fact that even after more than six weeks of war, they claim that they did not hit any of the civilian objects! Do you know why this is so? Because it's cowardice. Total. Of everyone. Top to bottom. They are afraid to admit that Russia's entire policy toward Ukraine has been erroneous for decades and has only ruined everything Russia had in its relations with Ukraine since previous times. They are afraid to admit that for decades they have been placing erroneous bets and spending enormous resources in support of absolute nobodies who they thought would be the future heroes of Ukrainian-Russian friendship. And these nobodies were skillful at only one thing - taking money out of Russia into their own pockets. In order not to admit mistakes, they made new mistakes. They deprived themselves of any political tools and, unwilling to give up unrealistic ambitions, started this war. And, as in everything else, they accused us that the war had begun. They seized Crimea - and we are allegedly to blame. They destroyed normal life in Donbas - and we are allegedly to blame. They shot down a Malaysian Boeing - and we are allegedly to blame. They have been killing people and children on our land for eight years - and we are allegedly to blame. They destroyed the most powerful industrial region in Eastern Europe - and we are allegedly to blame. They ruined the lives of millions of people - and we are allegedly to blame. They started a full-scale war against us - and we are allegedly to blame. They have already spent almost two thousand missiles, countless air bombs and artillery shells, mines on strikes at Ukraine - and we are allegedly to blame. They tortured and killed on our land - and we are to blame. They deported hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian men and women, our children - and yet we are allegedly to blame. It all came from cowardice. When cowardice grows, it turns into a catastrophe. When people lack the courage to admit their mistakes, apologize, adapt to reality, learn, they turn into monsters. And when the world ignores it, the monsters decide that it is the world that has to adapt to them. Ukraine will stop all this. Nothing will help Russian cowardice. The day will come when they will have to admit everything. Admit the truth. All our strength and every minute are aimed at this. Defense, diplomacy, economics, information confrontation, legal responsibility - we have algorithms of action in all areas. Every government official knows his tasks and must fulfill them one hundred percent. Next week will be no less important than this one than the previous ones. It will be just as tense and even more responsible. Russia will be even more afraid. Afraid to lose. Afraid that the truth will have to be admitted. Russian troops will move to even larger operations in the east of our state. They can use even more missiles against us, even more air bombs. But we are preparing for their actions. We will respond. We will be even more active in providing Ukraine with weapons. We will be more active in the international arena. We will be even more active in the information field. I will continue to address the parliaments and nations of the world. We will meet our partners, leaders of other states in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. We will attract even more funds and resources to help Ukraine. Of course, we will justify stronger sanctions against the Russian Federation. So that there is responsibility, so that there is justice. No matter how afraid they are to admit their mistakes - tragic, terrible mistakes - they will have to. Because our courage and our truthfulness clearly prevail. And they will win. Today is the twelfth anniversary of the plane crash near Smolensk, which took the lives of President Lech Kaczyński and members of the Polish elite. On this day, we stand in solidarity with our Polish friends and allies who are firmly opposed to Russian aggression. I spoke today with Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz. About how to bring to justice all those guilty of war crimes. How to strengthen sanctions against Russia and how to force Russia to seek peace. I am glad to note that the German position has recently changed in favor of Ukraine. I consider it absolutely logical. Because this course is supported by the majority of the German people. And I am grateful to them. But I expect that everything we agreed on will be implemented. And this is very important. And a few minutes ago, in preparation for the recording of this address, I signed a decree on state awards to our heroes. 18 defenders of Ukraine. Five servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, three employees of the State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine, ten police officers. I am grateful to all our male defenders! To all our female defenders! I am grateful to all those who restore life in the liberated territory of our state. And I am grateful to all those who ensure our victory in the information confrontation. To all journalists, to editors, to the information marathon ""United News"", to all our websites, to all media representatives that do not allow Russian propaganda to win. The truth will win! Ukraine will win! Definitely. Glory to Ukraine!"
"President of Ukraine: Mariupol is the heart of the war, which allows us to hold our positions in the east of the country",2022-04-10T13:49:00Z,"Thanks to Ukrainian defenders in the city of Mariupol in the Donetsk region, Ukraine today holds a strong position in the east and has a more confident position in negotiations with the Russian Federation. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an interview for the Associated Press. ""Mariupol is the heart of this war today. It beats, we fight, we are strong. If it stops beating, we will have weaker positions. These are people (defenders of Mariupol - ed.) who have made a large number of enemy troops to focus on them. The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position in the east of the country. And our positions will be stronger in the JFO area,"" he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that this situation creates advantages for Ukraine in the negotiation process with the Russian Federation. ""If we have a weak situation in all these areas, probably there will be no meeting, because Russia will take all the steps that could lead to a return to even those places that we have now de-occupied. They can go for it. And then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and, perhaps, even uninteresting for the Russian side,"" the President said. The Head of State is convinced that Ukrainian citizens will accept peace, because they want the war to end on the terms of Ukraine. ""I am convinced that there are people who have lost something - every family has lost something. There are people who have lost children, and I do not think that they will be satisfied with any peace on any terms at any time. Because it is a great wound and a great tragedy - to lose loved ones. But if we are not speaking emotionally, although it is difficult, we must understand that any war must end in peace or end in millions of casualties. And still, even when there are millions of casualties, everything comes to peace, to the end of the war,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. The President noted that in the current conditions it is necessary to fight for people's lives, so it is very important to stop this war. ""It's emotionally difficult. No one wants to negotiate with those who tortured this people,"" the Head of State said, but added that the possibility of ending the war through diplomatic decisions must not be lost. The President emphasized: ""We cannot afford to decide for the millions of people who want to stop the war and say: “No, we are not ready to talk because they are murderers"".  According to the President, if Ukraine was a member of NATO, this war could have been avoided or at least its scenario could have been changed. ""We would have the shoulder of close neighbors, powerful neighbors. We could fight together. And we are sure that there would be no war after all,"" the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that the West was late in providing Ukraine with some types of weapons that could have been transferred before the death of a large number of Ukrainians, for example in Mariupol. At the same time, according to him, some European leaders have already changed their minds and now support the supply of weapons to our country. ""I really notice it. Some European leaders have changed their position. But you see the price of these changes,"" the President summed up."
President held a conference call on maintenance of the army and readiness for combat missions,2022-04-10T12:16:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a conference call on the material and technical supply for the security and defense forces and their readiness to carry out current combat missions. The meeting was attended by Head of the Office of the President Andriy Yermak, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and members of the Government, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valeriy Zaluzhny, heads of law enforcement agencies and the National Security and Defense Council. The participants discussed the necessary diplomatic efforts to increase defensive support for our country and to increase sanctions on Russia. The projected impact of the 5th package of European Union sanctions on Russia was also discussed and proposals from Ukraine for the 6th package were developed."
Defense strategy for every civilized state is to put pressure on Russia to restore peace - address by the President of Ukraine,2022-04-09T22:27:00Z,"Free people of a brave country! Today, it was a great honor for me to welcome in our capital, on Bankova Street, a sincere friend of Ukraine - Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson on your behalf, on behalf of all Ukrainians. His visit to our country demonstrates as clearly as possible - there are no obstacles to freedom. There are no obstacles to leadership. Boris was among those who did not hesitate for a moment whether to support Ukraine. The leadership of the United Kingdom in providing our country with the necessary assistance, especially in terms of defense, as well as the leadership in sanctions policy will remain forever in history. In the history of the defense of democracy, in the history of the defense of Europe. Ukraine will always be grateful to Boris and Britain for this. Today Boris arrived in Kyiv with a new package of financial and defense support for Ukraine. We also discussed new sanctions that are needed to force Russia to seek peace. The task of our anti-war coalition is quite clear - to end this war started by Russia as soon as possible. To liberate our land from invaders. And to guarantee the security of Ukraine and, consequently, the security of democracy and freedom of the nations of Eastern Europe. That is why it is not just the moral duty of all democracies, all the forces of Europe - to support Ukraine's desire for peace. This is, in fact, a strategy of defense for every civilized state. To put pressure on Russia as much as possible to restore peace and security as soon as possible. To restore the power of international law as soon as possible and to prevent the catastrophe caused by the application of the law of force. The catastrophe that will inevitably hit everyone. Because Russian aggression was not intended to be limited to Ukraine alone. To the destruction of our freedom and our lives alone. The whole European project is a target for Russia. I was pleased to hear today from Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer an assurance that for the Austrian state to force Russia to seek peace is as fundamental as for other responsible states. I also heard the promise that Austria, together with its partners in the European Union, will continue its sanctions policy against Russia until the full restoration of real security in our region takes place. Until Russia withdraws all its troops from the Ukrainian sovereign territory. In response to my question, the Austrian Chancellor also supported a clear prospect of Ukraine's accession to the European Union as soon as possible. I would also like to thank Mr. Nehammer for handing over fire engines and rescue vehicles, as well as other equipment to Ukraine, and for helping with fuel. There is also important news today from President of the European Commission Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen and Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau. As part of their global Stand Up For Ukraine campaign, they have raised more than $ 10 billion to help our people. To help Ukrainians who were forced to leave their homes because of Russia's war against Ukraine. I am grateful to everyone who joined the fundraising! That is, today was a really fruitful day for Ukraine. For our diplomacy. And this is the 45th day of our defense against the Russian invasion. Could Moscow think that such events would take place in Kyiv on the 45th day after their invasion? No, they couldn't even imagine it. And we made it a reality. All of us, together - every Ukrainian who on February 24 and forever chose courage. Chose Ukraine. Chose freedom and the future. In all international negotiations, in all contacts with world leaders during these 45 days, I always raise three topics. The first is concrete assistance for our defense. The second is concrete assistance for our people. The third is concrete guarantees of security for our state, which will definitely win in this confrontation. Of course, I do not hear specific answers to my specific questions from everyone. But there are more and more positive things for Ukraine every day. However, still not as much so that we can determine the exact date of the end of this war. Russia can still afford to live in illusions and bring new military forces and new equipment to our land. And it means that even more sanctions are needed. Even more weapons for our state are needed. By the way, Boris Johnson was very specific today in answering my questions. Well, as always. We have already decided what help the United Kingdom will provide to the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine. The British people are ready to take patronage over the restoration of Kyiv and the Kyiv region. The introduction of more painful restrictions on cash flows of the Russian Federation is among the priorities for our diplomacy, for all contacts with our partners. First of all this applies to the oil business. The democratic world can definitely give up Russian oil and make it toxic to all other states. Oil is one of the two sources of Russian self-confidence, their sense of impunity. Another source - gas - will also be shut down over time. It's just inevitable. Not only for safety, but also for environmental reasons. But Ukraine does not have time to wait. Freedom does not have time to wait. When tyranny launches aggression against everything that keeps peace in Europe, action must be taken immediately. It is necessary to act in a principled fashion. And the oil embargo should be the first step. At the level of all democracies, the whole civilized world. Then Russia will feel it. Then it will be an argument for them - to seek peace, to stop pointless violence. And another piece of news for today. Long-awaited for many of our people. One of our main shrines will return to Ukraine. One of the most revered shrines of Sophia of Kyiv. The icon of St. Mykola Mokryi (Wet), the first miraculous icon of Russia. We've been working for a long time to get it back. It was taken out of Ukraine during World War II. And in due time it will be at home - in St. Sophia. I am grateful to the hierarchs, clergy and faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the United States for this decision. I want the return of this shrine to be an important symbol for all of us. A fundamental symbol. A symbol that we will return all ours to Ukraine. Everything Ukrainian. We will bring all our people back. And we will definitely restore justice - restore our complete control over our land. I am grateful to all our friends! I am grateful to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"
Ukraine and Great Britain will continue to strengthen anti-war coalition - Volodymyr Zelenskyy after meeting with Boris Johnson in Kyiv,2022-04-09T21:49:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson who arrived in Kyiv. The President thanked the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom for his visit to Ukraine at a difficult time for our country. ""This visit is a manifestation of strong, significant, constant support of the United Kingdom for Ukraine. We appreciate it and will remember it,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The President briefed Boris Johnson on the progress of negotiations with Russia, as well as on the importance of providing Ukraine with security guarantees. ""Peace agreements must provide a mechanism of effective guarantees for our state. We talked about this in detail today. We hope that in this process London will play a key role in achieving peace in Ukraine, it will be our common victory,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a statement to the media following talks with the British Prime Minister in Kyiv. The Head of State noted that during his visit to Ukraine, Boris Johnson could see with his own eyes the losses and destruction our country has suffered as a result of Russian aggression. ""The conclusion is one and it is common - we have to put even more pressure on the Russian Federation, to put pressure with effective defense against Russia, to put strong pressure in terms of sanctions. I am grateful to the United Kingdom for continuing these powerful sanctions, constantly increasing its packages, and also helping Ukraine by strengthening our defense capabilities,"" the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that other Western democracies should follow the example of Great Britain. ""It's time to impose a full embargo on Russian energy, to increase the supply of all weapons to us,"" he said. The President of Ukraine and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom identified key tasks for bilateral cooperation and coordinated further work. ""We are consolidating the maximum support for our state in strengthening the defense capabilities of our troops, in supporting our citizens both in Ukraine and abroad, in rebuilding Ukraine - we also talked about this with the Prime Minister. We will rebuild our country and our beautiful cities together,"" the President said. For his part, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom noted the courage of the people of Ukraine in the fight against Russian aggression. ""In recent weeks, the world has found new heroes. And these are the citizens of Ukraine,"" he stressed. Boris Johnson noted that war crimes committed by the Russian army in Bucha, Irpin and other Ukrainian cities have dealt a devastating blow to the reputation of the Russian government. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom spoke in favor of providing Ukraine with comprehensive support, especially economic and military-defensive support. Boris Johnson said that his country is willing to help Ukraine in demining territories. Together with partners it will supply equipment, the latest technology and provide intelligence data. He also called for increasing joint economic pressure with other partners and intensifying sanctions against Russia. In particular, according to him, it is a question of influence on possibilities of the Russian Federation to use its energy resources."
Ukraine will fight against aggression and at the same time look for opportunities for dialogue with Russia - President,2022-04-09T18:18:00Z,"Ukraine will fight against aggression, but is ready to negotiate with Russia to end the war through diplomacy. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, answering questions from the media after negotiations with Chancellor of Austria Karl Nehammer in Kyiv. ""Ukraine has always said that it is ready for negotiations and will look for any ways to end the war,"" the Head of State said. At the same time, he expressed regret that a significant concentration of Russian troops in the east and south of our country is taking place in parallel with the negotiation process. Without making predictions about possible actions of the enemy, the Head of State said that Ukraine will fight. ""Yes, the accumulation of troops continues in the east and in the south. A large number of troops, equipment, armed men who are going to occupy another part of our territories. It will be a difficult battle. We believe in our struggle, we believe in our victory. That is why we are ready to fight and at the same time look for certain ways in diplomacy that can stop this war,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. ""I will tell you frankly: so far we are talking about a parallel dialogue as well,"" the President added. Commenting on the situation on the frontline, Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that the course of events will depend on many factors. ""It depends on our firmness. It depends on the speed of our partners in the supply of weapons. It depends on the willingness of the leader of the Russian Federation to go further. It depends on many things. First of all, everything will depend on our Armed Forces, so the most important thing is for us to be ready in any of these areas,"" said the President of Ukraine."
"At a meeting in Kyiv, Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Chancellor of Austria discussed support for Ukraine and increasing sanctions pressure on Russia",2022-04-09T16:02:00Z,"At a meeting in Kyiv, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Federal Chancellor of Austria Karl Nehammer discussed support for Ukraine's path towards membership in the European Union, as well as increasing sanctions pressure on Russia to end aggression against our country. ""Several important issues were discussed regarding our bilateral relations, regarding full support for Ukraine’s future membership in the family of the European Union. We also discussed a strong sanctions policy against Russia and the increase of sanctions,"" the President said during a meeting with media representatives following negotiations with Karl Nehammer. The President thanked Austria for humanitarian aid and equipment, including fire engines for the SES, which will help Ukraine cope with the consequences of the Russian invasion. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also thanked Karl Nehammer for his visit to Ukraine at this difficult time and for his desire to see the whole truth with his own eyes, in particular, by visiting the city of Bucha. ""This is a great signal that the leaders of European countries, though not all, are beginning to come to Ukraine, supporting us not only in words. They themselves see what is happening here and what are the consequences of Russia's invasion. This is very important for us,"" the President said. The President stressed that the Chancellor of Austria has a deep understanding of our situation and the consequences of Russia's eight-year war against Ukraine, including after the full-scale invasion. For his part, Karl Nehammer said that his country fully supports the sanctions imposed by the European Union on Russia. According to him, Austria plans to strengthen sanctions policy within the EU until the war in Ukraine ends. The Chancellor noted that Austria supports Ukraine in all necessary matters.

He also stressed that Austria will make efforts to create reliable humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of Mariupol residents.

"Volodymyr Zelenskyy after the meeting with the President of the European Commission: Ukraine's goal is to be in the EU, because we share common values and fight for them",2022-04-08T23:58:00Z,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the European Union for the political, financial and military support of Ukraine and called on the EU to continue to impose sanctions on the Russian Federation until it gives up its aggressive intentions. The President made this statement during a conversation with media representatives following the negotiations with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell in Kyiv. ""The goal is to be in the European Union. The most important thing is that we share the same values. And it is for them that we fight - for freedom, for the rights of our people,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The President also thanked Ursula von der Leyen for the financial assistance Ukraine had received during the difficult times of the war, when our country's economy had suffered losses as a result of Russia's military invasion. ""I know for sure that we will win and it will all work. And at this distance, right here, near us are the countries of the European Union and the EU leadership. And this financial support is very important today, when the economy is not working yet,"" said the President of Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed gratitude for the support aimed at supplying weapons to Ukraine, as well as for the EU's sanctions policy against Russia. ""I want to thank you for a strong sanctions policy. I am grateful to the whole world, to the European Union, to Ursula von der Leyen. I am personally grateful for the fifth package of sanctions,"" he said. The Head of State stressed the importance of increasing sanctions against the aggressor country. ""Please help us with your sanctions. They must be increased, otherwise Russia does not want to hear anyone or anything,"" the President is convinced. ""They took a lot from us. Both territories and people were taken away. We will be able to return the territories and we will not be able to return the people. And for all this, I am sure, there will be a great, fair responsibility,"" he added. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also thanked the President of the European Commission for visiting the city of Bucha in the Kyiv region, which was liberated from the Russian occupiers. ""This is a very strong signal that Ukraine and the European Union are together. Together in the struggle for justice, dignity, in the struggle for the value of our lives, the value of human life. This is a confirmation that we will work together,"" he said. For her part, Ursula von der Leyen handed over to the President a questionnaire for Ukraine to obtain the candidate status for membership in the European Union. ""Ukraine belongs in the European family. We have heard this very important statement from all your people. And we give a positive answer to your request,"" said the President of the European Commission addressing Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ""Your journey to the European Union begins. I'm sure it's a close path,"" she added. Handing over the questionnaire to the President of Ukraine, Ursula von der Leyen noted that this process usually takes years, but in the case of Ukraine it takes weeks. ""We are ready. We will answer everything in a week,"" the President said. The President of the European Commission also noted that Ukraine is facing a very long way to recovery, as Ukrainian cities and infrastructure are now being brazenly destroyed. ""Therefore, we want to work with you, to restore Ukraine, and this will positively determine Ukraine's path to the European Union,"" she said. Ursula von der Leyen emphasized that what the world saw in Bucha in the Kyiv region was a challenge to humanity and a basis for excluding Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. ""Will this win or will our humanity prevail?"" Will autocracy dominate or will democracy lead? Will the law of force win or the rule of law prevail? That is what is at stake in this war,"" she said. The President of the European Commission assured that in this war the EU stands side by side with Ukraine. And today, in particular, many issues were discussed on how the European Union can strengthen its support for the Ukrainian state. ""We will never be able to match the sacrifice made by the Ukrainian people, but we are mobilizing our economic power to make Putin pay a very, very high price,"" said Ursula von der Leyen. Among other things, she mentioned five waves of sanctions, noting that a new package is being prepared. According to the President of the European Commission, the EU is moving to a system of deployment of sanctions. EU member states have also frozen $ 225 billion of private assets of Russia since the start of the war, she said. Ursula von der Leyen stressed that Ukrainians who are currently defending their country carry the torch of freedom for the whole democratic and free world, so Ukraine will be provided with defensive support. She reminded that our country is provided with 1 billion euros of aid, of which 120 million euros are provided for budget support, 330 million euros will be provided from the emergency package, another 600 million euros are macro-financial assistance. ""We will enable Ukrainian warriors to fight for Ukrainian and European freedom, because you are fighting for all of us,"" she said. High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell said the EU would assist the Prosecutor General's Office in providing evidence to the International Criminal Court. He also said that the EU Delegation to Ukraine is returning to Kyiv. Josep Borrell is convinced that the embassies of the EU member states will follow this example. ""You are fighting for us. And the least we can do is give you weapons. So that you get the weapons you need to resist, to fight and to win,"" said the EU High Representative."
The strike on Kramatorsk must be one of the charges at the tribunal regarding Russia's war crimes - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-04-08T23:37:00Z,"Ukrainians! The 44th day of our defense against the Russian invasion is coming to an end. The 44th dark day. Russian troops launched a missile attack on the Kramatorsk railway station this morning. 38 people died on the spot. Another 12 people died in hospitals during the day. We lost five children. Dozens more heavily wounded remain in hospital. This is another war crime of Russia, for which everyone involved will be held accountable. Russian state propagandists were in such a hurry to shift responsibility for the attack to Ukrainian forces that they accidentally blamed Russia. RIA Novosti reported that the strike on Kramatorsk had been inflicted when the missiles were still in the air. The day before, other Russian propagandists were spreading threats to all those who escaped from Donbas by rail. All the world's leading powers have already condemned Russia's attack on Kramatorsk. We expect a firm, global response to this war crime. Like the massacre in Bucha, like many other Russian war crimes, the missile strike on Kramatorsk must be one of the charges at the tribunal, which is bound to happen. All the efforts of the world will be aimed to establish every minute: who did what, who gave orders. Where did the rocket come from, who was carrying it, who gave the order and how the strike was coordinated. Responsibility is inevitable. I spoke about this today with representatives of the European Union who arrived in Kyiv. With President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and head of European diplomacy Josep Borrell. During the day, they visited Bucha and witnessed the consequences of the occupation. They saw how many people were killed by the Russian military. I appreciate the EU's readiness to provide the necessary financial and technical assistance to document and investigate Russian crimes. I am grateful to the President of the European Commission for her personal involvement and assistance in setting up a joint investigation team to establish the full truth about the actions of the Russian occupiers and bring all those responsible to justice. I am also grateful for the financial support - one billion euros for weapons. Plus today we agreed on another 500 million euros for defense needs. I held negotiations with the Prime Minister of Slovakia and thanked for the unprecedented defensive and other support. For the warmth of Slovak hearts towards Ukrainian men and women. We also talked with EU officials about further steps to force Russia to seek peace. I emphasized that the existing sanctions are not enough. The pressure on Russia must be increased. It is necessary to introduce a full energy embargo - on oil, on gas. It is energy exports that provide the lion's share of Russia's profits and allow the Russian leadership to believe in its impunity. This allows Russia to hope that the world will ignore the war crimes of its army. We will not allow this. Everyone in the world who has the courage, like Ukrainians, to resist tyranny will not allow this. Russian banks must also be completely disconnected from the global financial system. Not some of them, but all, the entire banking system of Russia. It is inadmissible that the greatest threat to global security is finding its way to global wealth. In this context, I also evaluate the new announced package of sanctions against Russia. I believe the softness with which some in the West still treat the Russian state is wrong. We know who is constantly trying to soften sanctions proposals. And we will do our best to finally make Europe understand: in any case, you will have to impose really principled and really strong sanctions against Russia. And not some partial restriction of Russian energy exports. Not some partial restriction of Russian navigation. We know everyone who delays the decisions. But I am confident that both these politicians and these countries will change their position under the pressure of all that Russia is doing against Ukrainians and against freedom in Europe. I addressed the Parliament and the people of Finland today. I called on Finnish politicians to do everything possible to help Ukraine. I also reminded that the best way to stop tyranny and protect freedom is to provide Ukraine with the necessary weapons. The weapons we have repeatedly asked for from the West. The weapons that are available there. I will continue to fight every day, literally every hour, to get everything our state needs. Russia's war against our people may end in victory of freedom much sooner than many in the world think if Ukraine simply receives the weapons the list of which we have provided. Any delay in providing such weapons to Ukraine, any excuses can mean only one thing: the relevant politicians want to help the Russian leadership more than us Ukrainians. No matter what, we will continue to protect our land and our people in any case. Yes, not everyone in the world has found the courage we have. But we have powerful and principled partners and friends. Real friends who help Ukraine to really protect us. To really protect freedom in Europe. I am convinced that Ukraine's victory is only a matter of time. And I will do my best to reduce this time. By the way, we also talked today about the time needed for Ukraine's full accession to the European Union. Today we received a questionnaire from the European Commission. Finally. A questionnaire the answers to which will be the basis for preparing the conclusion of the European Commission on Ukraine's readiness for EU membership negotiations. Our Government will prepare answers qualitatively and very quickly. I think in a week. Next is the conclusion of the European Commission, which will be prepared in the next few months. And then there will be the decisions of the member states and the negotiations on accession. I am convinced of our success on this path. I am convinced that we are finally close to realizing our long-standing goal. Ukraine will be one of the equals in our common European home. Ukraine will be a member of the European Union. A peaceful, sovereign, rebuilt state. We will provide it. There is no doubt. We are also preparing for tomorrow's mass event in Warsaw, which will take place within the initiative of President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau – Stand for Ukraine. It is about the support for Ukrainians, for our migrants. All funds will be allocated for the support of Ukrainians. Glory to Ukraine!"
"The fight against Russia's aggression united not only the Ukrainian people, but also the European Union - Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-04-08T23:30:00Z,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is convinced that the fight against Russia's military invasion of Ukraine has become a factor that has united both the entire Ukrainian people and the European Union, which has united around the support of Ukrainians. The atmosphere of dialogue and relations between Ukraine and the EU is now the best in many years, said the President during a conversation with media representatives after talks with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell in Kyiv. ""Unfortunately, I have to say that this is primarily due to the war. The war united Ukraine completely, united our people with authorities, that's why Ukraine is so strong. Unfortunately, this war also brought many victims, and around this, to protect Ukraine and Ukrainians, it united the European Union. And the world in general,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. The President is convinced that the answers to all questions in the relations between Ukraine and the EU will be found eventually. ""The most important thing now is for us to be united. And even when the leaders of certain countries slow down certain processes, the people of all European Union states - I see it and all Ukrainians see it - take to the streets, to the squares of European cities. These people united for the sake of Ukraine,"" he said. The Head of State stressed that today it is necessary to overcome the aggressive policy of the Russian Federation towards the people of Ukraine. ""And towards the people of Ukraine means towards the people of Europe as well, because we have the same values,"" the President stressed. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the imposition of sanctions is a substantial diplomatic weapon of the EU against the Russian aggressor. Therefore, it is important for these measures to be not superficially but deeply elaborated, well thought out and completed, so that Russia cannot bypass them."
Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with the Prime Minister of Slovakia in Kyiv,2022-04-08T23:08:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic Eduard Heger who is on a visit to our country. The President thanked the Slovak people and personally the Prime Minister of Slovakia for supporting Ukraine and providing real assistance in the form of weapons that strengthen our country's defense capabilities in times of the Russian invasion. ""I want to thank the Slovak people and the Slovak Prime Minister not for the future, but for the present, for what they are doing for us during the war. Fully supporting us, our position, condemning the aggression of the Russian Federation not only in words, but also in deeds,"" said the President of Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that he would not disclose details of this support and stressed that this was historically important assistance. According to the Head of State, during today's visit of Eduard Heger to Kyiv, the Prime Minister of Slovakia also held talks with Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal, and many important issues for the future of our state were discussed. Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the Slovak side for supporting Ukrainians who were forced to flee their homes due to Russia's military invasion. For his part, the Prime Minister of Slovakia thanked the President and the citizens of Ukraine who are fighting for the ideals of freedom and democracy, defending European values. Eduard Heger noted that the Slovak Republic will continue to provide assistance to Ukraine, because the successful struggle of our country is a success for the whole of Europe. In particular, he focused on the defense support for the Ukrainian state. The Prime Minister of Slovakia also stressed the importance of establishing a fund for the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine."

"Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Eduskunta, the Parliament of Finland",2022-04-08T15:05:00Z,"Dear Mr. Speaker! Dear Mr. President! Dear Mrs. Prime Minister! Members of the Government! Dear Eduskunta deputies! Dear Mr. Federal President of Germany! Dear Chairman of the Swiss Federal Assembly! People of Finland! I'll start with what happened this morning. The Russian military struck at the railway station in our city of Kramatorsk. At the usual train station. At the ordinary people, there were no militaries. At the people who were waiting for trains to leave to a safe area. They hit people with missiles. There are witnesses, there are videos, there are remnants of missiles, but there are no more people. At least 30 dead. About 300 wounded. This is for now. Once again: this is an ordinary train station. An ordinary city in the east of our state. That's how Russia came to ""defend"" Donbas. That's how Russia came to ""protect"" Russian-speaking people. This is how we live for the 44th day. After 8 years of war in the east of our country. I ask you to honor the memory of all Ukrainian men and women killed by Russian soldiers, Russian missiles, Russian bombs with a moment of silence... Thank you. Russia has sent all its combat capable forces from all over their territory up to the Far East to seize Ukraine. But even they were not enough. That is why Russia is gathering as many people as possible who are capable of holding weapons in order to continue the aggression against Ukraine. Looking for mercenaries around the world. Sending militants from various de facto terrorist groups and so-called ""private armies"" created by some Russian officials. We have seen so many of them among the captured Russian military. Both very experienced killers and very young boys born in 2003-2004. But none of them could adequately explain why they need this war against Ukraine, what is the purpose of these missile strikes at civilians, what is the purpose of the cruelty that the world saw in Bucha and other cities liberated by the Ukrainian army. Of course, among the nearly two hundred thousand Russian occupiers on our land were those who did their best not to fight. Who fled to Russia, who deliberately surrendered, who inflicted severe injuries on themselves to get to the hospital and leave the war zone. But still it was a minority. And the majority of their army continues war on our land for no apparent reason. Absolutely pointless. And as cruel as possible. Continues to fight in a way that you often think - are they people at all? Yesterday, the Russian military fired from artillery at a boat with civilians on the Kakhovka reservoir. People were just trying to escape from the occupied territories. But they were hit by ""Grad"". Three children, eleven adults. On the boat. In the middle of the reservoir. Tens of meters from the shore. And they are being hit by artillery... Hundreds and hundreds of cars with gunshot traces remained on all roads of our country in the areas where Russian troops entered. Ordinary cars of ordinary people who just wanted to live. The Russian military knew for sure that those were ordinary civilians. They saw that there was no threat. But they fired. There are many examples of such cars with people who were simply crushed by armored vehicles. Literally - crushed by tanks. You all know what the Russian military has done in our city of Bucha. But they still make such Buchas every day - from Kramatorsk to Mariupol, from Kharkiv to Kherson. And I'm sure you realize that if the Russian army is ordered to invade your land, they will do the same to your country. I do not wish you this. They will do what happened in Bucha to your cities. To the cities of any country that the leadership of the Russian Federation decides is allegedly part of their empire, not the land of another nation. And even if Russian soldiers do not understand why they need it, they will still be at war. Because it is hatred and contempt for other people that are being brought up now in Russia at the state level. Ladies and Gentlemen! People of Finland! You have already seen in your history the cruelty and absurdity of the invasion of Russia. Let's be honest: the threat remains. Everything must be done to prevent this from happening again. Russia's war against Ukraine is now deciding not only the fate of our state. Not only the fate of our people. But the fate of all those who have a common border with Russia. Like you 83 years ago, Ukraine has the courage to defend itself against the enemy whose forces far outnumber them. There are just a lot of them, in quantitative terms. They have a lot of equipment and a lot of missiles. A lot of people who can be thrown into the war. And a lot of dollars and euros earned from oil trade that are then spent on propaganda of aggression. But just as your courage saved your country from Stalin's invasion, our courage resists this invasion. For 44 days already. But much remains to be done to win. Of course, unlike before World War II, the democratic world has now realized that the expansion of tyranny cannot be ignored. If the people are fighting for freedom, they must be supported. But, unfortunately, this understanding is more common among nations than among some very influential politicians. Among smaller states than among some leading states. We still have to convince the world's powerful states on a daily basis that sanctions against Russia that it will not be able to circumvent and that will definitely stop its military machine are necessary. We still have to ask for the necessary help, for the necessary weapons. And we are still told that we still have to wait for the aircraft, anti-missile systems, tanks, anti-ship weapons. We are told that we have to wait while we are losing hundreds of people every day from Russian strikes. When dozens of our cities are destroyed. We have to wait while more than ten million Ukrainians have become IDPs. And we have to wait. When more than three million of these ten left our country... We must do everything together so that they can return home. We must do everything to stop Russia, to stop the war! So that peace is restored in Ukraine, and the Russian occupiers leave our sovereign territory. This cannot be delayed, ladies and gentlemen. We are told that we have to wait... But I have a question: should both those who kill our people and those who make us wait be held jointly accountable for the deaths of Ukrainians? Those who make us wait for the most necessary. Wait for the opportunity to defend ourselves, our life, wait for the weapons. I am sincerely grateful to Finland for not delaying when this invasion by the Russian Federation began. For coming to our aid immediately. For the fact that you made a historic decision to provide Ukraine with defense support. For being principled in sanctions matters. For being one of the moral leaders of our anti-war coalition. But I ask you to show even greater leadership, both at the level of the European Union and in bilateral relations with European countries, to support our struggle for freedom. For our common freedom. When this war continues, when tyranny loses the war against Ukraine, it will be one of the greatest contributions to Europe's security in decades. Consequently, one of the greatest contributions to the security of your state. That is why we need the weapons that your EU partners have. That is why we need truly effective, powerful sanctions against Russia. Permanent. Such a sanction cocktail, which will be remembered as Molotov cocktails. Insist on it! I am grateful to the Finnish companies that have already stopped working in the Russian market. But economic ties with this country must be severed, and I urge you to put pressure on all your companies that continue to support the Russian military machine through their taxes and excise duties in Russia. All Russian banks must be immediately isolated from the global financial system. We cannot limit ourselves to a partial response to Russia's threat to Europe and the democratic world, because freedom will not survive if the channels of nourishing tyranny are left. And we need to think together about how to protect Europe from Russia's energy weapons. Every educated person knows that the time of fossil fuels has passed. Mankind can no longer rely on coal, on oil. We need to look for cleaner energy sources for everyone. And if Russia uses energy to finance aggression against other nations and the spread of hatred in the world, it should be an additional incentive. This should speed up the decision-making process. How much longer will Europe ignore the need to impose an embargo on oil supplies from Russia? This is a matter of security in all senses of the word - from environmental to military. And I urge you to ask this question out loud to everyone in the European Union. So that the necessary decision finally appears. The world knows the formats of how to do it. And if Europe does not want to physically cut off supplies now, if it is not ready, although it is inevitable, the first step must be to apply a scheme to limit the flow of money for oil into Russia. Let this money accumulate on special accounts without Russia's access to it. Let Russia first restore peace and be held accountable for war crimes, and only then take its dollars and euros from oil trade. Let it remember the spirit of Helsinki and restore the Helsinki Accords in full, and only then will it be possible to discuss the economy, if necessary. And when we say that we need to stop the war, it is clear to all cultures and it is clear in all languages. When I say this in Ukrainian, it seems to me that there are no people who do not understand this. The same goes for German, Arabic, Chinese or any other language. Peace is the same value for all. War is the same evil for all. Ladies and Gentlemen! People of Finland! I believe that common sense will still prevail. I am confident that together we will be able to defend freedom and defend Ukraine. That is why we need to think now about how to rebuild our state after this war. The world knows about the leadership of your country, your people in the field of education. You have really built an educational system that allows you to protect personal freedom, make a person educated and teach respect for other people, the environment and the world. Other countries should learn this, too! During the month and a half of the Russian invasion, 928 educational institutions in Ukraine have already been destroyed or damaged. These are kindergartens, these are schools, these are universities. I invite your state, your companies, your specialists to join the restoration of our educational sector and the modernization of education in Ukraine. We must do everything we can to ensure that, even after this brutal war against our nation, our people continue to cultivate goodness in their hearts and stay open to the world. I believe in that. Because hatred must lose. Freedom must win. First - in Ukraine, and then - wherever tyranny will try to raise its head. Thank you Finland! Glory to Ukraine!"
First Lady Olena Zelenska addressed the officials of the member states of the Council of Europe,2022-04-08T13:22:00Z,"First Lady of Ukraine Olena Zelenska addressed the participants of the conference on the new Strategy for the Rights of the Child (2022-2027), which took place under the auspices of the Council of Europe. The address of the President's wife was read by the Ambassador of Ukraine to Italy Yaroslav Melnyk. In her address to the participants of the event, the First Lady of Ukraine noted the importance of universal protection of children's rights. She said that due to a full-scale Russian attack on our state, Ukrainian children cannot exercise their rights. ""Since the beginning of the war, the Russian Federation has violated the inalienable right of every child - the right to life guaranteed by the UN Convention. Due to the attack of the invader, all the rights of Ukrainian children are now completely violated. Because it turned out that for Russia all these rights do not matter. Our children's right to medical treatment has been violated, as more than 270 medical institutions have been damaged or completely destroyed. The right to education has been violated. Despite the Safe Schools Declaration, more than 300 educational institutions have been intentionally damaged or destroyed. And about four million - half of our children! - became displaced persons: they no longer have their usual home. What's worse is that there are hundreds of children in Ukraine with whom we have no contact. We simply don't know anything about their fate! They are with their parents in the cities occupied by Russians or for which fighting is taking place,"" said the First Lady. She announced a moment of silence for 165 Ukrainian children whose deaths were confirmed at the time of her speech. Olena Zelenska thanked the Council of Europe, which responded immediately to the unjustified and unprovoked aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, and on March 16 completed the procedure for excluding Russia from the organization, in accordance with Article 8 of its Charter. At the same time, the President's wife stated that the skies over Ukraine were never closed to Russian planes: “From the very beginning of the war, we asked NATO to close the skies over our cities, over Ukraine. To prevent bombs and rockets from falling on people. We were not heard. Well, now I ask you to at least ensure the right of children to get out of danger. They need real humanitarian corridors, because now the enemy is shooting at civilian cars as well as at military ones."" She also called on the participants to ensure, in accordance with the declared goal of ""child-friendly justice"", an international investigation and punishment for all Russians who in one way or another have committed and continue to commit violence against children in Ukraine. In conclusion, Olena Zelenska wished the audience, including children from different countries, that there would be no war in their lives. ""But to this end, you need to know about such a threat. The right to know is also an inalienable right of adults and children,” the First Lady concluded."
We are consolidating international support for youth infrastructure development - Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine,2022-04-08T10:58:00Z,"Ukraine is actively working to consolidate international support for the restoration of destroyed and the construction of new youth infrastructure. This was stated by Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Oleksiy Dniprov during an online conversation with the leadership of the National Democratic Institute (NDI, USA), which was dedicated to the development of democracy and youth spaces in Ukrainian settlements affected by large-scale military aggression against Ukraine. The meeting was also attended by NDI President Derek Mitchell, people's deputy of Ukraine, co-chair of the Youth Council under the President of Ukraine Oleksandr Sanchenko, as well as heads and experts of European and Ukrainian NDI offices. The meeting was moderated by Denys Hanzha, member of the Youth Council under the President of Ukraine. The participants of the event discussed the difficult humanitarian situation that has arisen as a result of the aggressive war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. During the meeting, in particular, the parties agreed on ways to coordinate efforts to develop youth policy in Ukraine, as well as discussed possible project areas that can be implemented in cooperation with the authorities, civil society and NDI."
Being brave is our brand; we will spread our courage in the world - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-04-07T23:39:00Z,"Ukrainians! The 43rd day of full-scale war is over. Russia's war against Ukraine. A war that has revealed the whole truth about our country, about all other countries, about Russia and about the world in general. This war shows how much everyone did not want to notice in our country. In our people. How much the world believed in foreign propaganda and Russian myths about Ukraine, not in reality. We have always been like that... We have always been brave. The bravest in the world. I am sure of that. Because who else would do what Ukrainians do? Who else had so much courage to constantly fight against any manifestations of tyranny and defend freedom? In every election, in revolutions and in war. Who else had the courage to fight against all Russian forces on land, in the air and at sea? Who else had the courage to go unarmed against Russian armored vehicles where the Russians temporarily managed to seize something? Who else had the courage to tell the world that hypocrisy is a bad weapon? And not just to tell, but to convince and restore honesty in the world. Who else had the courage to persuade the largest global companies to forget about accounting and recall morality? And to teach all political leaders - whatever they are - to be at least a little Ukrainian... At least a little brave. In fact, this is our brand. This is what it means to be us. To be Ukrainians. To be brave. If everyone in the world had at least ten percent of the courage that we Ukrainians have, there would be no danger to international law at all. There would be no danger to the freedom of the nations. We will spread our courage. We will start a special global campaign. We will teach the world to be not just a little bit, but full of courage. Like us, like Ukrainians. There are certain results already. First of all, they are manifested in the current sanctions against the Russian Federation. But that's the thing - the results are still ""certain"". Not yet the ones needed to stop Russia. To stop the war. Please note: this is not the first day that the media has been talking not about how sanctions against Russia actually work, but about why these sanctions are important. As if they are convincing themselves that they have introduced the right things, that there are enough restrictions. But if the sanctions really worked one hundred percent, they would not have to explain in such detail why they are important. Therefore, I emphasize once again: more sanctions are needed. Even bolder sanctions are needed. Courage must be a criterion for evaluating decisions. Courage and practicality. First of all, Ukraine needs weapons that will allow us to win on the battlefield. And this will be the strongest sanction against Russia of all possible ones. We have good diplomatic news today. Russia is gradually losing even on those platforms that it considered quite comfortable for itself. In particular, the UN General Assembly decided to suspend Russia's membership in the Human Rights Council. It is quite logical. Quite rightly. But also not without fighting for this decision. I am grateful to those states that have supported this decision. Russia has had nothing to do with the concept of human rights for a long time already. Maybe someday that will change. But so far, the Russian state and the Russian military are the greatest threat on the planet to freedom, to human security, to the concept of human rights as such. After Bucha, this is already obvious. And the work on dismantling the debris in Borodyanka began... It's much worse there. Even more victims of the Russian occupiers. And what will happen when the world learns the whole truth about what the Russian military did in Mariupol? There, on almost every street, is what the world saw in Bucha and other towns in the Kyiv region after the withdrawal of Russian troops. The same cruelty. The same heinous crimes. More and more information is coming in that Russian propagandists are preparing, so to speak, a ""mirror response"" to the shock of all normal people from what they saw in Bucha. They are going to show the victims in Mariupol as if they were killed not by the Russian military, but by the Ukrainian defenders of the city. To do this, the occupiers collect corpses on the streets, take them out and can use them elsewhere in accordance with the elaborated propaganda scenarios. We are dealing with invaders who have nothing human left. To justify their own killings, they take the murdered people simply as scenery, as propaganda props. And this is a separate war crime, for which each of the propagandists will be held accountable. More and more countries around the world support the need for a full and transparent investigation of all war crimes of the Russian occupiers in Ukraine. Every murder case will be solved. Each of the torturers will be found. All those who committed rape or looting will be identified. Responsibility is inevitable. Today I continued to address the parliaments and nations of neighboring countries, our partners, our friends. Today was Greece. Today was the Republic of Cyprus. I thanked them for supporting Ukraine and joint European efforts to force Russia to seek peace. I urged to do more to stop the war. I urged Greece to use its influence as part of the European Union to save Mariupol. I urged Cyprus to take special measures against Russia. Such as the abolition of ""golden passports"" for Russians. As well as the blocking of yachts, the blocking of other Russian vessels in the waters of Cyprus. I am planning an address to the Parliament and the people of Finland tomorrow. I would like to note that diplomatic representatives of other states are returning to the capital together with Kyiv residents. The Turkish Embassy returned yesterday. The Ambassador of Lithuania returned today. Earlier, the Slovenian Embassy resumed its work in Kyiv. I am sincerely grateful to the friends of Ukraine who support us exactly as we need it now, also at the level of symbols, at the level of diplomatic gestures. This is also about courage. And I look forward to the opportunity to have a meeting with everyone who is with us. With all who are brave. Come back. With all the diplomats who have returned to our capital and continue to work. The presence of foreign diplomatic missions in Kyiv is a normal work of embassies, it is a clear signal to the aggressor that Kyiv is our capital. Not the provincial city of Russia, but the Ukrainian capital. The Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to do everything to repel the offensive of Russian troops in Donbas. The occupiers' troops in this area are becoming more active and are being reinforced from Russia. We see it all. We analyze every step of the enemy. And we will provide an answer. A tough one. And already a stable tradition: before delivering this address, I signed decrees to honor our bravest soldiers with state awards and the title of Hero of Ukraine. 344 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded. Five more servicemen became Heroes of Ukraine today. I am sincerely grateful for the service to each of our male defenders. I am sincerely grateful to each of our female defenders! I am sincerely grateful for the courage of the Ukrainian people. Glory to Ukraine!"
Speech by the President of Ukraine in the House of Representatives of Cyprus,2022-04-07T20:05:00Z,"Dear Mr. President of the Republic of Cyprus! Dear Mrs. President of the House of Representatives! Dear ladies and gentlemen, deputies! Dear Cypriot people! I am grateful for the honor of addressing you in this format and at this time. At a crucial time for my country and for the survival of the Ukrainian people. For freedom in Europe. It is now being decided whether we will preserve the unity of our territory and our state. Whether we will guarantee freedom for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe. For different countries where Russian troops can go after Ukraine. Every day and night we think of only one thing - how to save as many people as possible. How to help everyone we can to survive Russia's brutal invasion. An invasion that has already killed thousands of Ukrainians. Shot, tortured, killed by missiles, air bombs, tanks. The Russian military does not spare anyone - neither women nor children. Ukrainians have not seen such atrocities since the Nazi invasion during World War II. And I ask you... Please, just look. Look at what we have been going through for 43 days already. Please watch a short video. *** God forbid any other nation will have to go through this… Experience how Russian soldiers killed people on the roads in Bucha for fun. How in Irpin, they raped underage girls and then strangled them as experienced killers. How in Mariupol, a little girl was forced with gunshots to run down the street. Because it is permissible for them to hunt people, it is fun for them. How in Kharkiv, dozens of ordinary civilians were killed in a minute by the artillery shelling of residential high-rises. When you see so many deaths every day... When killed people are buried in mass graves in your cities, just in the yards, because it is impossible to take bodies to cemeteries... You hope and seek, and believe that you will be able to save at least those whom you especially sympathize with. At least those who certainly cannot be involved in any disputes of the adult world, in any conflicts. Since March 10, Ukrainians have hoped to find a little boy alive, little Sashko. A four-year-old boy who disappeared when adults escaped from the occupiers on a boat across the Dnieper. There was no other way to escape then - the Russian military blocked all roads. They shot people on the roads. So the adults tried to escape from them by the river. But the boat capsized. According to witnesses, after the shelling... Sashko was the only one in the life jacket, so we hoped until the end. We hoped to find him alive. Sashko's grandma died. And later we found his body. He became one of 167 children who died during the full-scale Russian invasion of our state. And these are only those about whom we know for sure. There may be many more children killed in the occupied areas, in the cities around which hostilities are taking place. Children whose lives were taken by this war, Russia's war against Ukraine. Why does Russia wage this war? What is the goal of Russian troops? The answer to these questions is quite clear. We have heard it many times from politicians in the Russian Federation and from Russian state propagandists. We also know this answer from those documents that were seized along with Russian prisoners of war and found in the destroyed headquarters of Russian troops. They wanted to destroy our statehood and tear our country apart. Divide Ukraine into parts. They wanted to take as much as they could. And all that they could not capture, they wanted to weaken as much as possible, to destroy as much as possible. Russia sought to create a new split in Europe that would meet the inadequate ambitions of the current generation of Russian leaders. They simply do not take most countries in the world seriously. They do not respect most nations. They consider everyone in the world either as those they want to use, or as those they want to conquer, or as those they want to intimidate. They consider Ukraine among those in the second group. That is why Russia came to us with the war. But all other states should think into which group they were included and what really underpins Russia's policy toward them. I am sure that no country in the world will find two things among the answers to this question - true respect and not feigned equality. That is why the democratic world has united in its negative attitude towards Russia. Ukraine was attacked by Russia a long time ago - in 2014. When Russia tried to divide our state by force for the first time. When our Crimean peninsula was occupied. When Russia started the war in Donbas. But then the world's response was weak, very weak. Many in the world still believed that constructive relations could be at the heart of relations with Russia. That the dialogue with Russia can be sincere and based on the principle of mutual respect. Years have taught the world that this was all a mistake. And the invasion of Ukraine on February 24 this year showed that the Russian leadership perceived the good attitude of other states simply as a weakness. Can such behavior go unpunished? Is it right that the Russian state and its citizens are trying to use your island to their advantage? While trying to destroy the whole nation. While trying to destroy another state. Ladies and Gentlemen! Cypriot people! I am grateful to you for the principled position with which you, together with the whole of the European Union, responded to Russia's full-scale invasion. You have adopted a powerful decision not to allow Russian warships to enter your ports. This really strengthens security throughout our region of great Europe. I am also grateful to you for your financial and humanitarian assistance. For an important resolution passed by your parliament in support of Ukraine. But Ukrainian children are still dying from Russian weapons. All our citizens still live in hell because of what the Russian occupiers have done on Ukrainian land. Russia is still preparing plans for a new offensive against our troops, against our cities... The Russian leadership still does not want to seriously seek peace with Ukraine. In response to all our negotiating proposals, which could have been accepted long ago in the interests of peace, in the interests of all in Europe, we hear only a play on words. This means that much more needs to be done, both at the EU and national level, to end this war. To force Russia to seek peace. Peace is an unconditional value for each of us. Therefore, I believe that together with you we will be able to provide the necessary pressure on the Russian leadership. The Republic of Cyprus has extremely powerful tools to influence Russian society. A unique force that can be put at the service of peace. All ports in the democratic world must be completely closed to Russian ships. This must be a joint decision - at the level of the European Union. But at the level of your state, it is also possible to at least freeze the use by Russians of all their yachts and other vessels in your waters. You can suspend the current privileges for Russian citizens. Starting from the so-called golden passports for all Russians without exception and ending with dual citizenship for them. Probably if it is verified and clearly proven that some of them condemn the war crimes of their military and do not intend to use your jurisdiction to avoid sanctions and other restrictions against Russia, only then will it be permissible to treat these people in the old way. Any efforts by Russian citizens subject to sanctions to circumvent these restrictions must be stopped. All the proper work needs to be done to prepare the European Union for the imminent embargo on energy supplies from Russia. I do not know how many more war crimes of the Russian military must be revealed, as it was in our city of Bucha, before all EU states have enough courage for the embargo. But Russia itself has chosen this path. It destroys innocent people in Ukraine. The democratic world must stop being a sponsor of Russia's war crimes. Of the destruction of cities, killing of children. And the democratic world must learn to guarantee real security for every state that can fall victim to aggression. When Ukraine says that we deserve full membership in the European Union, we mean, first of all, that we can bring to our common European home exactly the experience that can make each EU state stronger. It is an experience that can give Europe more justice. I'm sure you feel our pain. And that is why I believe that you will continue to support Ukraine, including on the road to the European Union. On the way to our common peace. Thank you for your support! Glory to Ukraine!"
Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Parliament of Greece,2022-04-07T14:17:00Z,"Dear Mr. Speaker! Dear Mrs. President! Dear Mr. Prime Minister! Dear members of the Greek Parliament! Greek people! Kalimera! For more than a month now, my every morning begins with Mariupol. With what is happening in this Ukrainian city, which Russian troops are simply destroying. This has never happened in the history of Europe in all the years after World War II that a city is destroyed to ashes, destroyed completely. That it is under blockade and its inhabitants are killed with starvation and thirst. It was a city of half a million people! About a hundred thousand people still remain in it. But there are virtually no undamaged buildings, the vast majority of buildings in the city are completely destroyed. The Russian military destroyed everything. They blew up hospitals, maternity hospitals and apartment buildings. They even blew up the city theater where civilians were hiding from bombs and next to which were inscriptions that everyone saw - the inscriptions ""children"". The inscriptions seen by Russian pilots, which did not stop them from air strikes. Mariupol is almost destroyed. I'm sure each of you has already seen what the city looks like now. After it was approached by the Russian Federation. Just ruins. This is what Russia has done with our peaceful Mariupol. But also with your peaceful Mariupol. This city has always been home to a large Greek community. The Ukrainian Greek community is one of the largest in the world. For centuries, our people have lived side by side, raised children and built the future. The ties between Ukraine and Greece are so old that it is now impossible to find their origin. Greek poleis on our Black Sea coast, cultural exchange and trade, community coexistence - all this is thousands of years of history. Greek Chersonesus was even depicted on our national currency - hryvnia. It is with Greece that the development of Christianity is tied not only in our country, but also in our region in general. Ukraine is one of the largest Orthodox countries, and the light of Baptism was brought by the Greeks. If someone tried to snatch Greek roots from Ukrainian history and culture we would lose a fundamental part of ourselves. In the same way the basic things of your history, your national self-perception are tied with the Ukrainian land. ""Freedom or death!"" - these words now reflect not only our struggle against Russia's attempt to conquer Ukraine. This is a part of your identity that comes from our Odesa. Another southern city of Ukraine that Russia may try to destroy, as well as Mariupol. When your foreign minister was in Odesa last week, the city was experiencing the consequences of Russian shelling, another missile attack. There are no gunshots in Odesa today. But why? Only because the Armed Forces of Ukraine are deterring Russian attacks and repelling barbaric Russian troops from their direction of attack on Odesa long-agreed by Russian leadership. Russian troops have now brought death and destruction to where Ukrainians and Greeks have enjoyed peace and prosperity for centuries. Moreover, Russia has begun a new deportation of people from the south of Ukraine. At least tens of thousands of our people have already been deported to Russia and to the territories of Ukraine temporarily occupied by Russia. These are residents of Mariupol and other cities and communities that came under attack by Russian troops. This forced relocation of people by Russia is not the first one for both Greeks and Ukrainians. But the Russian state is carrying it out now as if deportation is not the last one. Russia is absolutely convinced of its impunity for everything it does. We have to stop it! We must bring Russia to justice. We must save Odesa from the same destruction that Mariupol suffered. We must find everyone, all the people deported by Russia. We must save at least those in Mariupol who are still alive and who can be saved! Ladies and Gentlemen! Greek people! Filiki Eteria, founded in our Odesa, has played a role in the history of your country, which cannot be overestimated. And I urge you now, openly, to create such a new union of friends, which will be able to save the Ukrainians and Greeks of the south of our state. Which will be able to help Mariupol. The city needs humanitarian aid! The city needs its people - survivors and wounded - to be saved. Russia has been blocking Mariupol since the beginning of March, blocking on land and at sea. It does not allow even basic humanitarian cargo into the city. I am convinced that the strength of Greece can help carry out this mission. Days are numbered. And now I ask you to listen not only to me. Regarding the fate of this city. Please listen to the two defenders of Mariupol who are now there, right there, and together with their colleagues are trying to stop the Russian offensive. Listen to two Ukrainians, but also two Greeks as well. One of them is forced to wear a mask, not to show his face. Because his family, his parents are in one of the Russian-occupied towns. I hope you understand. *** I am grateful to Greece for the humanitarian and defense support already provided to Ukraine. I am grateful for the support of the general sanctions policy of the democratic world. But the war continues. The destruction of Mariupol continues. You have heard these heroes. The deportation of people from the territories where Russian troops came continues. I urge you to use the influence of your state and your opportunities, as a member of the European Union, to organize the rescue of Mariupol. I urge you to do more to make Russia seek peace and even give up its dreams of conquering Ukraine. Because this war that Russia has started against us is actually destroying everything that Ukrainians and Greeks have created together in a long time. What will be left after the Russian artillery and Russian bombs? I will tell you: they will destroy all our common history, our common heritage. And we will not be comforted saying about Mariupol in the future: ""These are new Thermopylae"". When the heroes died, stopping a large enemy army. Now we can save our heroes. And we can also drive the enemy Russian army out of Ukrainian land. We can teach Russia and any other potential aggressors once and for all that whoever chooses war always loses. He who tries to deprive of independence and destroy the territorial integrity of states always loses. Anyone who blackmails Europe with an economic or energy crisis always loses. Let's be honest, Russia's actions from the beginning were aimed not only at Ukraine, but at Europe as a whole. Russia is doing everything to keep Europeans without available energy. And to make energy poverty a new reality on the continent. Russia is doing everything to provoke an outbreak of inflation for many nations. Russia last year artificially created a deficit in the European gas market. And now it is doing everything to artificially create a deficit in the world food market. It is a matter of honor for Europeans to respond to such a policy of the Russian Federation. As long as Russian troops block peaceful cities and deport people, no Russian bank has the right to make money from the world's financial system. They all must be blocked! All, not just part. As long as this pointless and brutal war continues, no Russian vessel has the right to enter the ports of the democratic world. Why help them? For them to earn even more money for missiles and bombs to destroy not only Mariupol, but also Odesa and other Ukrainian cities? And first of all - no support for Russian tankers, these oil carriers, which provide Russia with a constant flow of money for the killings. Ukraine needs weapons to force Russian troops to leave our country. In particular, air defense systems, artillery systems and shells, armored vehicles and other things that everyone in the West is well aware of. The sooner Ukraine receives this assistance, the more lives we will be able to save in Ukraine. And one more thing. Historical. Our nations have always been and will always be closely bonded. I believe that we will be able to bring peace to our Ukrainian land. We will be able to bring to justice all those responsible for these war crimes against Ukrainians, against Greeks and against all other people who fell victim to the Russian military. We will be able to rebuild Mariupol and all other Ukrainian communities where Ukrainians and Greeks will live just as peacefully and with respect for each other as it was before. But I also believe that Ukraine and Greece will soon live on an equal footing in our common European home, the European Union. I believe in this! I know it! We will win everyone! But only together! Thank you for your support! Glory to Ukraine!"
"If there is no really painful package of sanctions against Russia, it will be considered by Moscow as a permission to attack - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-04-07T00:30:00Z,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! It seems that the attitude to the modern Russian state is finally changing in the world. After what the world saw in Bucha when Russian troops retreated. Now the attitude to everyone in Russia will be simple: you support either the search for peace or unjustified massacre. Killed Ukrainian men and women in Bucha, in Irpin, in other cities that Russian troops entered is the last argument. The last argument for every citizen of Russia to decide whether you are for war or for peace. If for war, then you will forever - until the end of your life - be outcasts and in the end you will lose everything. And if for peace, if you feel even a little bit of shame for what the Russian troops are doing in Ukraine, then now is a key moment for such citizens of Russia: you have to demand - exactly demand - an end to the war. It is better now, demanding peace, to lose something, to somehow face the Russian repressive machine than to be equated with the Nazis for the rest of your life. This applies not only to any public person in the Russian Federation, not only to businessmen, but also to ordinary citizens. Nazism has no future. Mass killings have no future. Everyone in Russia who will not demand an end to this shameful war and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine has no future. It seems that the Russian leadership is really afraid that the anger of the world because of what they saw in Bucha would be repeated because of what they will see in other cities, from where we will definitely drive out the occupiers. We have information that the Russian troops have changed their tactics and are trying to remove the killed people from the streets and basements of the occupied territory. Killed Ukrainians. This is just an attempt to hide the evidence and nothing more. But they will not succeed, because they killed a lot. Responsibility cannot be avoided. We already know about thousands of missing people. We already know about thousands of people who could be either deported to Russia or killed. There are no other options for their fate. The situation now is that thanks to an objective investigation, thanks to witnesses, thanks to satellite surveillance of events on earth, thanks to other tools that help establish the truth we will find out all the circumstances regarding the majority of our missing citizens. Regarding most of Russia's war crimes in Ukraine. If the world has started a debate about whether it is permissible to call what the Russian military did on the territory of Ukraine genocide, the search for truth can no longer be stopped. You can't roll it back in any way. One can only quickly abandon further aggression against Ukraine and thus try to somehow reduce the damage to Russian statehood and to those who personally adopt key decisions in Russia. If not, if nothing changes, then it is suicide. Suicide for anyone who chooses to continue the war. Today, Western countries announced a new package of sanctions against the Russian Federation. New investments in Russia are blocked, restrictions are applied against several systemic banks in Russia, personal sanctions are added, as well as other restrictions. This package has a spectacular look. But this is not enough. Still it can hardly be called commensurate with the evil that the world saw in Bucha. With the evil that continues in Mariupol, in the shelling of Kharkiv, in Russia's attempt to launch a new global bloody offensive in Donbas... We will continue to insist on a complete blockade of the Russian banking system from international finance. We will also continue to insist on one or another format of the democratic world's refusal to buy Russian oil. It is the export of oil that is one of the foundations of Russia's aggression. One of the foundations that allows the Russian leadership not to take seriously the negotiations on ending the war and on the liberation of Ukrainian territory. Some politicians are still unable to decide how to limit the flow of dollars and euros to Russia from the oil trade, so as not to jeopardize their own economies. But that's why people go into politics. To solve such problems, difficult tasks. To solve them quickly and in a principled fashion. If you are not capable, then you shouldn't have started political activity. The embargo on Russian oil supplies will be applied anyway. The format will be found. The only question is how many more Ukrainian men and women the Russian military will have time to kill, so that you, some politicians - and we know you, can borrow a little determination somewhere. It is good that the United States Department of the Treasury has suspended Russia's ability to use US bank accounts and related assets to pay its debt. It's tangible. And I'm grateful for that. But much more needs to be done to stop the war. If there is no really painful package of sanctions against Russia and if there is no supply of weapons we really need and have applied for many times, it will be considered by Russia as a permission. A permission to go further. A permission to attack. A permission to start a new bloody wave in Donbas. It is still possible to prevent this. It is still possible to impose such sanctions, which Ukraine insists on, our people insist on. It is still possible to give us weapons that will really stop this aggression. The West can do it. Just as it could have applied preventive sanctions last year to prevent this invasion. If the mistake is made again, if there is no preventive action again, it will be a historic mistake for the whole Western world. I addressed the parliament and the people of Ireland today. This country was one of the first to come to our aid after February 24. And it is one of those who shows principled leadership in the European house to put effective and decisive pressure on Russia. As a result of my address, we have good news: Ireland fully supports Ukraine's accelerated accession to the European Union. And it will do everything to increase the pressure on Russia as much as necessary to end this war. Tomorrow I will address the parliaments and nations of Greece and the Republic of Cyprus. In the afternoon I held a meeting with members of the Cabinet of Ministers in Kyiv. The key issues are the implementation of the state budget and economic activity in our country. We must do everything possible to restore the work of domestic enterprises, trade activities, and revive small and medium-sized enterprises throughout our territory where it is safe and possible to work. The economy is also a frontline on which we fight for our freedom, for our state, for our people. Therefore, we need to constantly look for ways to adapt to the circumstances. Now we need to be as creative and bold as possible in solving economic issues. It depends not only on government officials and the central government in general. In general, it also depends on all leaders at the local level, on the political and business communities. We must all find the necessary ideas, the necessary solutions to stabilize the country's economy together. If we need to relocate businesses from certain areas, we have to do it. If we need to update legislation and give businesses more room for development, MPs must do so quickly. If we need to create special conditions for the return of people, and the security situation in a particular area allows, every leader at any level must make every effort and do everything possible to return people to such safe areas. Today, the 42nd day of the Russian invasion has come to an end. This is not too much for military history. But for the life of a particular person - it is tangible. Right now, many of our people who left their cities, their communities after the invasion of Russia may wonder: what next? And where next? In particular, Ukrainians abroad. In particular, Kyivans and residents of other cities in the north and center of our state who moved to the western regions. And I call on all community leaders in areas where there is no threat of direct confrontation with the enemy on the ground to do everything possible for people to return, for people to work, for economic processes to restart. To restore normal life as much as security allows. This applies to the entire horizontal of local government - mayors, deputies of city and regional councils. Look for solutions for every district, for every region! Together with the government, together with us, with the Office of the President, together with the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada. A working economy is just as important as our brave, strong army. The Russian occupiers continue to accumulate fighting force to realize their ill ambitions in Donbas. They are preparing to resume an active offensive. We are preparing for a further reduction of Russia's military potential. Manpower and equipment. We will fight and we will not retreat. We will look for all possible options to defend ourselves until Russia begins to seriously seek peace. This is our land. This is our future. And we will not give them up. I never tire of thanking each of our defenders everyday - all our Armed Forces, intelligence, special services, the National Police, everyone who allows us to hope and believe in victory. Allows us to count on peace. Sincere gratitude! Sincere respect! And before delivering this evening's address, I traditionally signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 168 servicemen of the Armed Forces. And 3 servicemen from the Main Directorate of Intelligence. Eternal glory to everyone who defends Ukraine! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for our state! Glory to Ukraine!"
Sanctions against Russia must be destructive enough to stop this heinous war - Andriy Yermak,2022-04-06T21:07:00Z,"Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak held a regular online meeting of a group of Ukrainian and international experts established under the auspices of the Office of the President to analyze the real impact of sanctions against Russia, provide proposals for strengthening existing and implementing new effective measures. Andriy Yermak expressed confidence that the recommendations and advice of these experts will help build a system of sanctions in the near future that could help stop the heinous war waged by Russia against Ukraine. ""The war continues. Everyone saw the horrors that took place in the city of Bucha. And that means sanctions are not enough to stop Russia. Therefore, all of us and our partners need to work to ensure that sanctions are sufficiently destructive,"" said the Head of the President's Office. Former US Ambassador to Russia and former US National Security Adviser Michael McFaul, co-ordinator of the international expert group, suggested focusing on sanctions on oil and natural gas, which is known to be the lion's share of Russia's exports. ""We must focus our efforts on sanctions against Russia's oil and gas exports. The money of European consumers should not go to the state budget of Russia in order to further finance Putin's terrible machine of destruction in Ukraine,"" said Michael McFaul. Rostyslav Shurma, Deputy Head of the President's Office, added that work should also be done to recognize the Russian Federation as a sponsor of terrorism and to include it into the blacklist of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to restrict trade with Russia. He also noted that it is necessary to disconnect from SWIFT the entire banking system, including Sberbank and Gazprombank, ban land transport, including rail, prohibit ships from entering Russian-controlled territory, Russian ports, and ban transport that belongs to the Russians or carries out the transportation of goods of Russian owners from entering international ports. Andriy Yermak also added that it is necessary to impose an embargo on the supply to Russia of any technology, equipment, minerals and ores, rare earth dual-use minerals and thus stop the production of weapons in Russia. In addition, it is necessary to expand the list of sanctions against politically significant persons of the Russian Federation and members of their families. According to Andriy Yermak, secondary sanctions are very important, i.e. inclusion in the sanctions list of legal entities and individuals of other countries that help the persons of the Russian Federation subject to sanctions to avoid restrictions."
President of Ukraine held a meeting with members of the government on the implementation of the state budget,2022-04-06T17:44:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a meeting with members of the Cabinet of Ministers and representatives of the Office of the Head of State on the implementation of the state budget for the current year and the introduction of an embargo on trade with Russia. According to Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, in the first quarter the state budget was implemented by 110%. This was facilitated due to the results of the first two months of this year and advance tax revenues. In the second quarter, according to the Prime Minister, a significant shortfall in Ukraine's state budget is expected as a result of Russia's military invasion. The participants of the meeting discussed possible sources of filling the state treasury. In particular, it is donor assistance, special drawing rights from the IMF, etc. In case of unfavorable developments, the possibility of temporary reduction of certain social expenditures starting from May is being considered. According to the participants of the meeting, in order to prevent the implementation of such a scenario, it is necessary to start the functioning of the domestic economy as soon as possible - both heavy industry and small and medium-sized enterprises. The President instructed the government to formalize the cessation of Ukraine's trade with Russia. In fact, import and export operations with the aggressor state were completely terminated with the start of the war."
"Speech by the President of Ukraine in Oireachtas, Parliament of Ireland",2022-04-06T14:13:00Z,"Dear speakers! The Taoiseach and members of the government! Dear members of the Oireachtas! Dear people of Ireland! Tonight Russian missiles again struck the territory of our state. Foully hitting the ordinary civilian infrastructure. In particular, the new depot with fuel. One of the dozens that Russia sees as a target. And this has already become the trademark of the occupiers – to destroy everything that helps to arrange ordinary life of ordinary people. They consistently destroy fuel storage sites, product distribution centers, destroy even conventional agricultural machinery, and mine fields. They are constantly sowing mines everywhere. In every place they are leaving. In addition, Russia has blocked all our seaports, along with those vessels that have already been loaded with agricultural goods for export. Why are they doing this? Because they also consider hunger as their weapon. Weapon against us, ordinary people. As a tool to dominate. Ukraine is one of the leading countries in the global food market. Without our exports, it is not simply a shortage, but a threat of famine for more than a dozen countries in Africa and Asia. Because there will be not enough volumes of commodities and prices will hike. It's a fact. It will be harder for millions of the poor in North Africa and parts of Asia to feed their families. Now, it is the time of the planting season in Ukraine. To foil our planting season, to destroy our infrastructure is to deliberately provoke a food crisis. And what will happen due to this crisis? At least, it will be political turbulence. At most, there will be outbreaks of violence in regions where instability is becoming traditional, and a new mass influx of refugees who are simply looking for ways to survive will be seen. Russia has been using hunger against our people since the first days of the war. The worst is in Mariupol. This half-million city was completely blocked by Russian troops more than a month ago. They blocked access from both land and sea. Any access. They are blocking humanitarian goods, do not allow to bring anything – food, water, medicine. When there was snow, people could melt at least the snow to get water, but now there is none. Round-the-clock shelling, air raids, bombing continue... There is not a single building left in Mariupol, not a single undamaged building. In the city with the population of half a million – none. The dead and killed were buried in the yards of destroyed high-rise buildings. When they were able to do it. But in many cases it was not possible to bury. The bodies of people remained in the streets, in the ruins of houses, in collapsed basements. We do not know how many Mariupol residents have been killed by Russia. But we know for sure that this was part of the general tactics of the occupiers. They did the same or tried to do the same with Chernihiv, Sumy, Okhtyrka, Kharkiv, Izium, Volnovakha and many other Ukrainian cities. You may not have heard all these names yet. But these are millions of people that Russia was simply trying to destroy. And continues to do so. When you hear this, it may seem impossible. It may seem that no one in today's world would dare to do so. But these are real facts. The fact that the residents of Mariupol drew on the sheets of school notebooks how to find where the bodies of their loved ones are buried in the city yards. The fact that the Russian occupiers shot people on the roads as they tried to escape from the blocked cities. Hundreds of cars hit by shelling are still left on Ukrainian highways. The fact that the Russian military did not even try to remove the bodies of killed people from the streets. While Bucha, Irpin and other our cities were under occupation, the corpses were laying just on the roads, on the roadsides, in the yards of houses – anywhere... The fact that at least 167 children have been killed in 42 days of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. We do not yet know all the victims of Mariupol. We do not know the victims of other cities, areas where hostilities or occupation continue. The fact that 927 educational institutions and 285 hospitals have been destroyed or damaged in the shelling by Russia. Even 73 ambulances have come under the occupiers' fire! They bombed and shelled even churches... Even shelters, which they knew for sure that there was no one there but women and children... And that's a fact. A state that does this does not deserve to be among others in the international community. Russia does not deserve relations with it as with one of the normal states. It must be responsible for everything it has done on Ukrainian land. The Russian military came to Ukraine as an army of colonizers. Their state propagandists, their politicians don't even hide what they want anymore. In the 21st century, they see their state as a colonial empire that allegedly has the right to subjugate neighboring nations and destroy any basis for their independent living. Destroy even the very identity of nations. Everything that makes us Ukrainians... The Russian military purposefully searched for and killed teachers in the occupied territories. Everyone who was associated with the army. They kidnap local government officials and kill community leaders. Along with the Russian army, units to suppress any political resistance immediately they entered our territory were created... Now, when there are discussions about sanctions against the Russian Federation, I just can't hear any doubts, I can't see any indecision... After everything we have experienced in Ukraine. After all that the Russian troops did. Even now, when the world already knows everything about Russia's war crimes against our people, we have to persuade even some European companies to leave the Russian market. We still have to convince Western politicians in some countries that we need to stop any connection between Russian banks and the global financial system. Unfortunately, we still have to convince Europe that it is impossible that Russian oil provides the Russian military machine with a generous flow of money. Ladies and Gentlemen! Irish people! From the first days of the Russian invasion, you are on the side of good. On the side of freedom. On the side of Ukraine. And this is also a fact. You have no doubt whether to help us. You started doing it right away. And although you are a neutral country, you have not remained neutral to the grief and suffering that Russia has brought to Ukrainians. I am grateful to all of you for that. I am grateful to the leadership of your country, to every Irish man and woman. I am grateful for the support of sanctions against Russia. I am grateful for the humanitarian and financial support provided to us. Thank you for taking special care of our people who have sought and found safety in your land. Just think about it: Russia has already left homeless 10 million Ukrainians who were forced to flee their hometowns because of this war ... It is simply impossible to accept! But let us be aware that Russia has not yet given up on its plans. It is still continuing offensive operations in Ukraine. It is still looking for ways to conquer all our Ukrainian people. We must do everything together so that Russia forced to seek only peace. It seek only way to leave the territory of Ukraine and give us in peace. That is why I urge you to show even more leadership in our anti-war coalition! I urge you to persuade your EU partners to toughen sanctions against the Russian Federation. The sanctions that will really stop Russia's military machine. We need to stop all trade with Russia. Russia's banks' ties with the world's financial system must be blocked. We need to cut off the flow of money that the Russian budget receives for oil and spends it on missiles, bombs, artillery shelling... The world has long developed appropriate mechanisms. Everyone knows what to do. The only obstacle is the lack of principled stance of individual leaders. Yet. Political leaders, business leaders. Those who still think that war and war crimes are not as terrible as financial losses. I'm sure your leadership can change that. I am confident that all of us in Europe together will be able to end this terrible war and restore peace and stability in Eastern Europe. It is simply impossible to procrastinate with this. The longer the Russian aggression lasts, the worse the consequences will be not only for our continent, but also for the neighboring regions of our planet. Ladies and Gentlemen! Irish people! Our common principles, our common fearlessness have already started a new page in the history of relations between Ukraine and Ireland. Our mutual understanding and respect is at the level where we can say: it is only a matter of time before you and we live together in our common European home. I am grateful to you for supporting the special fast-track procedure for granting Ukraine membership in the European Union. With your leadership, it will be even faster and more profitable for both our nations. And now we need to think about the restoration of our country. About recovery after the war. We invite the leading countries of the planet to take part in the reconstruction of Ukraine. Of course, I invite Ireland to take part in this project. I do it with pleasure. For example, in our Kherson region. Your ability to value life and people, your ability to live in communities, your economic potential – they are well-known. So let's join forces and show that Ukraine and Ireland together can do much more than the world's largest state planned to destroy. Grateful to Ireland! Glory to Ukraine!"
"Kyiv is now the capital of global democracy, the capital of the struggle for freedom for all in Europe - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-04-06T00:16:00Z,"Ukrainians! Today I will not take away much of your attention. The day was very informative. I will only briefly walk through the main points of my work this Tuesday, the 41st day of the invasion of the Russian Federation. I continued my active diplomatic work. Addressed the UN Security Council, which convened for a special meeting on Russia's war crimes in Bucha and in the occupied territories of Ukraine in general. I said what should have been said in this format a long time ago. The UN Security Council exists, and security in the world doesn't. For anyone. This definitely means that the United Nations is currently unable to carry out the functions for which it was created. And only one state is to blame for this - Russia, which discredits the UN and all other international institutions where it still participates. Well, not exactly participates... Tries to block everything constructive and use global architecture in order to spread lies and justify the evil it does. I'm sure the world sees it. I hope the world will draw conclusions. Otherwise there will be only one institution left in the world to guarantee the security of states. Namely - weapons. I offered to the members of the UN Security Council and to all other states that respect international law specific things that could change the situation. In particular, a global conference already in peaceful Kyiv to determine how the world's architecture can be reformed given all the actions of Russia, which is still occupying the seat of a permanent member of the UN Security Council received from the Soviet Union. I also addressed the Parliament and the people of Spain. A state that supports our struggle for freedom and for the preservation of democracy in Europe. I also spoke today with President of the French Republic Emmanuel Macron about the humanitarian situation in the temporarily occupied regions of Ukraine. About how we can help people in the blocked Mariupol. We also agreed that France would provide the necessary technical and expert support in the investigation of the crimes of the Russian occupiers in Bucha and other cities of our country. We are preparing a new package of powerful sanctions against Russia for everything it has done to our people. Now is a crucial moment, especially for Western leaders. And this is no longer about how our people will evaluate the new sanctions and what I will say about them. This is about how decisions on sanctions will be assessed in Western societies themselves. After what the world saw in Bucha, sanctions against Russia must be commensurate with the gravity of the occupiers' war crimes. If after that Russian banks will still be able to function as usual... If after that the transit of goods to Russia will continue as usual... If after that the EU countries will pay for Russian energy resources as usual... Then the political fate of some leaders will develop not as usual. My advice to everyone: feel now that the moment is really crucial. We are preparing to welcome President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and head of European diplomacy Josep Borrell in Kyiv in the near future. Working together in Kyiv is something that will be praised by many nations of the world. And not only in Europe. Because now Kyiv is the capital of global democracy, the capital of the struggle for freedom for all on the European continent. And I want to thank all our defenders for making this possible. For the fact that the Armed Forces of Ukraine hold most of the areas where the enemy tried to break into the country. The most difficult situation, as in previous days, is in Donbas, in the Kharkiv direction. But we continue to do everything to ensure that our defenders have something to stop the Russian troops with. We are aware that the occupiers outnumber us. That they have more equipment. We are aware of the attempts by Russian leaders to recruit new fools all over Russia among cadets of military schools, people with combat experience and conscripts to send them all to slaughter in another offensive. But we have no other choice - the fate of our land and our people is being decided. We know what we are fighting for. And we do everything to win. Today in the Mariyinsky Palace I presented the Golden Star Orders to the servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine, and to the members of families of those who were posthumously awarded this title. Now it is in the Mariyinsky Palace, in the White Hall, where we always meet foreign heads of state, that such important ceremonies will take place. We will demonstrate every time that our defenders deserve respect and honor at the highest level. And the White Hall of the Mariyinsky Palace will henceforth be called the White Hall of the Heroes of Ukraine. I also handed over the Order of Courage to the family of the deceased documentary photographer Maks Levin who was viciously killed by the occupiers in the Kyiv region. During his life, he made a significant contribution to making us all see and know what is happening in our country. Traditionally, before delivering the evening address, I signed decrees awarding our military. 292 servicemen, 57 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal gratitude to each of our defenders! Everything for the victory. Everything for peace. Everything for Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!"
Speech by the President of Ukraine in the Cortes Generales of Spain ,2022-04-05T21:24:00Z,"Dear Mrs. President of the Congress of Deputies! Dear Mr. Prime Minister! Dear ladies and gentlemen, deputies and senators! Dear members of the Government! Dear people of Spain! Thank you for this opportunity, with great respect from all the Ukrainian people to you. I am addressing you with the hope that you will understand most of all our pain from the war and our hope for peace. Because for us in Ukraine now absolutely everything that is the basis of public life for you is under threat. We are one of the largest countries in Europe. And one of the most variegated. But united by democracy and respect for every person, for every community. I want to give you just one example of our state, of our lives. We have the All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations. Different denominations, different views on public life and relations between the state and the Church are always agreed peacefully and with respect for others in the format of this Council. This is just one example, but it shows that we, Ukrainians, are committed to peace and a conflict-free environment even in such sensitive issues that in many other societies always cause controversy and conflict. Russia came to our land with the war not yesterday and not the day before yesterday. It's been a long time. We have been protecting our country from brutal, unprovoked aggression since 2014. First - the occupation of our Crimea. Then - the war in the Ukrainian Donbas. Now - already 41 days of full-scale invasion. The worst war in Europe since World War II. But why did Russia come to us, to our home, to Ukraine? What exactly must Russian weapons destroy? Not just our people. Not just any basis for a peaceful life. But also the opportunity to live without a dictatorship. Opportunity to live without state violence. Opportunity to be a sustainable open democracy. Opportunity of peaceful coexistence of different religions, different communities. The format of Russian state life does not provide for everything that is absolutely familiar to us, to Ukraine. Russia wants to make sure that only one order dominates in our entire region - tyrannical. So that any diversity is destroyed. So that it is impossible to find common ground and compromises between different communities. This is exactly what is happening in Russia now. This is exactly what it wants to establish in Ukraine. And then in the whole region of Eastern and Central Europe. And what will happen next? I know that for your country, for Spain, it is important for a democratic system to be protected. For peace on the European continent to be guaranteed. But how can this be possible now? After Russia began to allocate all its state resources to the spread of war and the destruction of any basis of normal life. Just imagine this - mothers in Ukraine write on the backs of their young children the child's name, phone numbers of relatives with the usual pen... Why? Because if the occupiers kill their parents, there will be at least a small chance that someone will save these children. Imagine that people now - in Europe - live for weeks in basements to save lives. From shelling, from air bombs. Daily! 2022, April - and the reality in Ukraine is as if it's April 1937. When the whole world learned the name of one of your cities - Guernica. Imagine that in ordinary cities, conditions can be artificially created where more than a hundred thousand people live for weeks without water, without food, without medicine. Russian troops blocked our city of Mariupol more than three weeks ago. They are destroying this city completely - there is already nothing there but ruins. More than 90 percent of all buildings were destroyed! The killed people were buried in the yards near the destroyed high-rise buildings where they lived... Russian aircraft bombed even those buildings in Mariupol where they knew exactly people were hiding. Children were hiding... Ukraine speaks about it every day. Every day throughout the days of this invasion. But the war continues. Russia is not serious about peace. What is even worse is that we still do not know how much longer the war will last until the world finally does everything necessary for peace. Really powerful sanctions are needed. The most powerful. How can we allow Russian banks to generate profits while the Russian military tortures ordinary civilians to death in Ukrainian cities? How can European companies trade in a state that is deliberately destroying our people? I know that many of your companies have already stopped financing the Russian military machine through taxes. I want to thank you, your citizens, and your government. I am grateful to these companies, to your entire state and society for the principled stance on sanctions. But at the same time, I want to turn to some companies, such as Maxam, Porcelanosa, Sercobe and other companies - I think you know them better than I do - to stop doing business with Russia. What our city of Bucha, our city of Borodyanka, our other cities have experienced are war crimes. Crimes against humanity. Without statute of limitations. This is an absolutely clear basis for the Russian military and commanders to be convicted by an international court. In these conditions, how can the countries of the world freely buy Russian oil and allow Russian ships into their ports? Ladies and Gentlemen! Spanish people! Now the fate of not only our state is being decided on the territory of Ukraine. But also the fate of the whole European project, of the values that united us all. Us with you. Of democracy that united us all. Of human rights, which have become a fundamental value for all of us. I am grateful to your country for supporting common European decisions for peace. But all of us in Europe, all of us in the world need to do even more to force Russia to seek peace. So that Russia finally starts to respect international law. What is needed for this? Everyone in Europe must simply stop being afraid. Stop being weak. They have to become strong. Put values and democracy above the threats that Russia spreads. I am sure fear is not about you. But I ask you to do everything so that other European countries do not have fear as well. You can help us. Help the world. Give us the weapons we need. And we appreciate that help, that weaponry - all that you have already given us. You can support further sanctions that are needed. And you can also destroy the fear of Russia wherever you can see it. Because democracy should not fear. Freedom must be protected. Human rights must be above all calculations. The right to peace. The right to life. The right to happiness, to free development. The right to family security. The right to the future of children. The right to a decent old age of parents. The right to respect for every community. The right to be with you, Spain, together in a European family. Glory to Ukraine!"
Speech by the President of Ukraine at a meeting of the UN Security Council,2022-04-05T21:07:00Z,"Dear Mrs. President! Dear Mr. Secretary General! Dear members of the Security Council and other participants of the meeting! Thank you for the opportunity. I am sure that all the representatives of the UN member states will hear me today. Yesterday I returned from our city of Bucha, recently liberated from the troops of the Russian Federation. It is difficult to find a war crime that the occupiers have not committed there. The Russian military searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our state. They executed women outside the houses when approaching and simply calling someone alive. They killed whole families - adults and children. And they tried to burn their bodies. I am addressing you on behalf of the people who honor the memory of the deceased everyday. Everyday, in the morning. The memory of the killed civilians. Who were shot in the back of the head or in the eye after being tortured. Who were shot just on the streets. Who were thrown into the well, so that they die there in suffering. Who were killed in apartments, houses, blown up by grenades. Who were crushed by tanks in civilian cars in the middle of the road. For fun. Whose limbs were cut off, whose throat was cut. Who were raped and killed in front of their own children. Their tongues were torn out only because they did not hear from them what they wanted to hear. How is this different from what the ISIS terrorists were doing in the occupied territory? Except that it is done by a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It destroys the internal unity of states. Destroys state borders. Denies the right of more than a dozen peoples on two continents to self-determination and independent state life. Pursues a consistent policy of destroying ethnic and religious diversity. Inflames wars and deliberately wages them in such a way as to kill as many ordinary civilians as possible. To destroy as many ordinary peaceful cities as possible. To leave in the country where it sends its troops only ruins and mass graves. You've seen it all. Promotes hatred at the state level and seeks to export it to other countries through its system of propaganda and political corruption. Provokes a global food crisis that could lead to famine in Africa and Asia, and will certainly end in large-scale political chaos in countries where food price stability is a key factor of domestic security. So where is the security that the Security Council must guarantee? There is no security. Although there is a Security Council, as if nothing happened. So where is the peace that the United Nations was created to guarantee? It is obvious that the key institution of the world, which must ensure the coercion of any aggressors to peace, simply cannot work effectively. Now the world has seen what the Russian military did in Bucha while keeping our city under occupation. But the world has yet to see what they have done in other occupied cities, in other occupied areas of our country. Geography may be different, but cruelty is the same. Crimes are the same. And responsibility must be inevitable. Ladies and Gentlemen! I would like to remind you of the first article of the first chapter of the UN Charter. What is the purpose of our organization? To maintain peace. And to force to peace. Now the UN Charter is being violated literally from the first article. And if so, what is the point of all other articles? Today, it is as a result of Russia's actions on the territory of my state, on the territory of Ukraine, that the most heinous war crimes of all time since the end of World War II are being committed. Russian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities to ashes with artillery and air strikes. They are deliberately blocking cities, creating mass starvation in them. They are deliberately shooting at columns of civilians on the roads who are trying to escape from the territory of hostilities. They are even deliberately blowing up shelters where civilians are hiding from air strikes. They are deliberately creating conditions in the temporarily occupied territories so that as many civilians as possible are killed there. The massacre in our city of Bucha is just one, unfortunately, of many examples of what the occupiers have been doing on our land for 41 days. And there are many other such places that the world has yet to find out the full truth of: Mariupol, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Okhtyrka, Borodyanka and dozens of other Ukrainian communities, each of which is like Bucha. I know, and you know very well, what the representatives of Russia will say in response to the accusations of these crimes. They have said this many times. The most illustrative was after the downing of a Malaysian Boeing over Donbas by Russian forces with Russian weapons. Or during the war in Syria. They will blame everyone, just to justify themselves. They will say that there are different versions, and which of them is true is allegedly impossible to establish yet. They will even say that the bodies of those killed were allegedly “planted”, and all the videos are staged. But. Now is the year 2022. There is conclusive evidence. There are satellite images. It is possible to conduct a full, transparent investigation. That is what we are interested in. Maximum access of journalists. Maximum cooperation with international institutions. Involvement of the International Criminal Court. Full truth, full responsibility. I am sure that every state in the UN system should be interested in this. For what? In order to punish once and for all those who consider themselves privileged, consider themselves unpunished. Hence, to show all other potential war criminals in the world that they will inevitably be punished as well. If the biggest is punished, everyone will be punished. Why did Russia come to Ukraine, tell me? I will answer. Russia's leadership feels like colonizers - as in ancient times. They need our wealth and our people. Russia has already deported tens of thousands of our citizens to its territory. Then there will be hundreds. It abducted more than two thousand children. Simply abducted thousands of children. And continues to do so. Russia wants to turn Ukrainians into silent slaves. The Russian militaries are openly looting the cities and villages they have captured. This is looting of the highest scale. They steal everything from food to gold earrings they just rip out with blood. We are dealing with a state that turns the right of veto in the UN Security Council into a right to kill. Which undermines the whole architecture of global security. Which allows evil to go unpunished and spread the world. Destroying everything that can work for peace and security. If this continues, the finale will be that each state will rely only on the power of arms to ensure its security, not on international law, not on international institutions. Then, the UN can simply be dissolved. Ladies and Gentlemen! Are you ready for the dissolving of the UN? Do you think that the time of international law has passed? If your answer is no, you need to act now, act immediately. The power of the UN Charter must be restored immediately. The UN system must be reformed immediately so that the right of veto is not a right to kill. So that there is a fair representation of all regions of the world in the Security Council. The aggressor must be forced to peace immediately. Determination is needed. The chain of mass killings from Syria to Somalia, from Afghanistan to Yemen and Libya should have been stopped a long time ago to be honest. If tyranny had ever received such a response to the war it had unleashed that it would have ceased to exist and a fair peace would have been guaranteed after it, the world would have changed for sure. And then, perhaps, we would not have a war, a war in my country. Against our nation, the Ukrainian nation. Against people. But the world watched and did not want to see the occupation of Crimea, or even before - the war against Georgia, or even earlier - the alienation from Moldova of the entire Transnistrian region. It also didn't want to see how Russia was preparing the ground for other conflicts and wars near its borders. How to stop it? Immediately bring the Russian military and those who gave them orders to justice for war crimes in Ukraine. Everyone who gave criminal orders and fulfilled them by killing people will face a tribunal similar to the Nuremberg trials. I want to remind Russian diplomats that a man like von Ribbentrop has not avoided punishment after World War II. And I also want to remind the architects of Russia's criminal policy that punishment has reached Adolf Eichmann as well. None of the culprits will escape. No one. But the main thing is that today is the time to transform the system, the core of which is the United Nations. To do this, we propose to convene a global conference. And we ask to do it already in peaceful Kyiv - in order to decide. How we will reform the world security system. How we will really guarantee the inviolability of universally recognized borders and the integrity of states. How we will ensure the rule of international law. It is now clear that the goals set in San Francisco in 1945 during the creation of a global international security organization have not been achieved. And it is impossible to achieve them without reforms. Therefore, we must do everything in our power to pass on to the next generations an effective UN with the ability to respond preventively to security challenges and thus guarantee peace. Prevent aggression and force aggressors to peace. Have the determination and ability to punish if the principles of peace are violated. There can be no more exceptions, privileges. Everyone must be equal. All participants in international relations. Regardless of economic strength, geographical area and individual ambitions. The power of peace must become dominant. The power of justice and the power of security. As humanity has always dreamed of. Ukraine is ready to provide a platform for one of the main offices of the updated security system. Just as the Geneva office specializes in human rights, just as the Nairobi office specializes in the field of environmental protection, the Kyiv U-24 Office can specialize in preventive measures to maintain peace. I want to remind you of our peaceful mission in Afghanistan. When, at our own expense, we Ukrainians evacuated more than a thousand people from this country. And it was the hottest phase. But people needed help - and Ukraine came. Just like other states. We evacuated people of different nationalities, different faiths. Afghans, citizens of European countries, USA, Canada. We did not distinguish who needs help, whether these are our people or not. We saved everyone. If every time there was a need everyone in the world was confident that help would come, the world would be definitely safer. Therefore, Ukraine has the necessary moral right to propose a reform of the world security system. We have proven that we help others not only in good times, but also in dark times. And now we need decisions from the Security Council. For peace in Ukraine. If you do not know how to adopt this decision, you can do two things. Remove Russia as an aggressor and a source of war from blocking decisions about its own aggression, its own war. And then do everything that can establish peace. Or show how you can reformat and really work for peace. Or if your current format is unalterable and there is simply no way out, then the only option would be to dissolve yourself altogether. I am convinced that you can do without the third option. Ukraine needs peace. We need peace. Europe needs peace. The world needs peace. And finally, I’m asking you to watch the video. A short one. A video of what has come to replace your power because someone alone can abuse his rights. This is what impunity leads to. If possible - watch this video. Because there is no opportunity for everyone to come to us and see it. So watch it. Thank you."
Volodymyr Zelenskyy presented the Golden Star Orders to servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and members of the families of the fallen Heroes of Ukraine,2022-04-05T19:57:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy presented the Golden Star Orders to the servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine and the members of the families of the servicemen who were posthumously awarded this title. The ceremony took place at the Mariyinsky Palace in Kyiv. ""We are in the place where the leadership of our state met with the leaders of other states before the war. This place is called the White Hall of the Mariyinsky Palace. I also had meetings with many leaders of states whom this war showed as friends and partners or vice versa. And from today I have the great honor to award the best here. You are the leaders for our state,"" said the President of Ukraine, addressing the Heroes and members of their families. He added that from now on this hall will be called the White Hall of Heroes of Ukraine and those who have been awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine will be awarded here. ""I am honored to see you here today. Unfortunately, I cannot see all those Heroes perished in the war, in the struggle for our independence against the Russian Federation,"" the Head of State said. ""I want to thank everyone. I want to thank those who are not here with us today. Who are on the frontline, defending our country from the Russian occupier everyday,"" the President added."
"For the Ukrainian state, the issue of security should be in the first place for the next ten years - the President",2022-04-05T15:56:00Z,"Even if Ukraine signs the most powerful security agreement, Russia may return. Therefore, it is necessary to build a state that will be able to defend itself. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an interview to the Ukrainian media. The Head of State noted that all the points on security guarantees voiced after the talks in Istanbul remain unchanged. According to him, during the negotiation process, the Ukrainian side, along with the so-called denazification, rejected Russia's demand for demilitarization. ""We explained that the army must be in line with the army we have, which is able to defend our state. Then there are the details,"" the President said. ""Even if we sign the most powerful agreement, we understand that in two years Russia may return. And if you and I accept this, then we act accordingly,"" the President said. In view of this, Ukraine will build a state that will be able to defend itself, as the Ukrainian side openly states at the talks. At the same time, Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his conviction that Ukraine cannot fight constantly while other countries develop. That is why our state needs concrete security guarantees. According to the President, everything depends on the guarantor countries, which must ensure the implementation of certain points. ""All this is being discussed at the level of advisers and leaders with France, the United States, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Poland, Italy, Israel, and there are many friends who want to join. So far, we have not received a specific list of guarantees and a list of countries that are ready to join us 100%,"" the President said. ""We do not need to have 40 countries of the world that are ready to join and fight for Ukraine under the agreement. We need serious players who are ready for anything. We need a circle of states that are ready to provide any weapons within 24 hours. We need individual countries on which sanctions policy really depends, so that these sanctions are deeply elaborated in advance. So that in the first second when we feel the threat from the Russian Federation, these states will unite and within three days introduce everything at once, block everything,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy explained. According to him, representatives of some countries have already expressed a desire to become guarantors of security, but no joint meeting has taken place yet. ""They said they were ready to meet and talk about it. But I would like to emphasize once again that this meeting has not yet taken place in Ukraine. We are waiting for it. If this happens, there will be an understanding that we have certain security guarantees that provide for non-alignment,"" the President said. ""So far, all of these guarantors are positive about Ukraine. But this is not enough. We already had such agreements and ""papers"",” he added. As for joining NATO, according to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine is ready to join the Alliance ""already tomorrow"", even if Russia opposes it. ""If we are offered to join NATO tomorrow, if they don't play with our lives again, but seriously offer, we will join. But this will not happen, unfortunately, and did not happen. That is why we will build those security guarantees that can protect us, protect people's lives. We can protect ourselves anyway - we already understand that. But protecting all people is a more difficult task,"" he said. The President said that he would consider the preservation of Ukraine's sovereignty to be the first victory in this war. ""Second, I really want us not to lose hundreds of thousands of people. Third, there can be no discussion that we will allow someone to call Crimea someone's territory. This is our territory, Ukrainian territory. Postponing this issue is a compromise. And Donbas for me is Ukraine. And the fact that Russia has recognized ORDLO as something - we must find a way out of this situation. We, as Ukraine. Preserving the status of these territories as Ukrainian is very important for us,"" the Head of State said. In his opinion, the withdrawal of Russian troops to the positions of February 23, 2022 will be a victory. ""I understand where we are, who we are, what kind of country we are, what we have lost, what we can lose and what we have saved. I believe that repelling the full-scale war to the point where it began on February 24, 2022 is definitely a victory for us,"" said the President. Volodymyr Zelenskyy is convinced that after the end of this war, the issue of security should be number one in Ukraine. ""I think all our people will be our great army. We cannot talk about ""Switzerland of the future"" - probably, our state will be able to be like this a long time after. But we will definitely become a ""big Israel"" with its own face. We will not be surprised that we will have representatives of the Armed Forces or the National Guard in all institutions, supermarkets, cinemas, there will be people with weapons. I am sure that our security issue will be number one in the next ten years,"" the President said."
"Resolving the issues of Donbas and Crimea by military means will have a very high price for Ukraine, and this is well understood, first of all, by our military - Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-04-05T14:04:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that the issue of the temporarily occupied territories of Donbas and Crimea should not be tied to the negotiation process with Russia to end the war and withdraw Russian troops from the territories of our state where they entered starting from February 24. This was stated by the President in an interview to the Ukrainian media. He is convinced that resolving all issues in a package and thus ending the war with Russia is difficult and unlikely. Especially when there are tanks on our territory, rockets hit our cities, when there are difficult situations in blocked cities, such as Mariupol. ""Russia has its own vision of Donbas, and Ukraine has its own. So I had a simple suggestion. I believe that we will not be able to agree on all points at once. This is impossible, even if we have negotiations,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Responding to calls for the military liberation of all temporarily occupied territories, the President stressed that one of the most powerful groups of Ukrainian troops are fighting in Donbas, in the Joint Forces Operation area. They oppose the enemy, which significantly outnumbers them. And if you give them the command to go on the offensive now, it will cost thousands of lives. ""Our state needs a strong army. And if we want to lose the most powerful, most experienced people because ""I want it now"" we must understand that they will return to us (enemy forces - ed.), and not in two or three years, but in the same month. All the military know and think about it. This is a very serious story,"" he explained. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that there is indeed a concentration of Russian troops in Donbas, and Ukraine is well aware of the goal and possible plans of the Russian Federation. ""Donbas, and the south of Ukraine, and the corridor to Crimea, and the Kherson region, and the Zaporizhzhia region... We basically understand what they are doing. In order for them to succeed, they will fight for Donbas. And Mariupol is a life for us, a city, and for them it is a ""medal"" that they want to hang on their chests,"" he said. The President noted that today the deoccupation of Mariupol by military means is very difficult. And its defenders, who are fighting in extremely difficult conditions, know this very well. ""We are in touch almost every day. It is difficult for them. They are very strong. It's true. And it is difficult for different people in different ways. There are their wounded or dead brothers-in-arms. They would like their parents to receive the bodies of the dead, and they would like us to have an opportunity to take out the wounded,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. According to him, there is an agreement on this issue with Turkey, which is ready to transport the wounded and killed in Mariupol from Berdyansk. ""We have all the infrastructure ready to take out the wounded and dead. We are waiting for Putin's approval. I talked to Erdoğan, Erdoğan talks to him. And now this moment depends on him. If we succeed, we will see the result in the coming days. If it fails, we will know for sure that the President of the Russian Federation personally does not give such an opportunity. Although everyone is putting pressure from different sides, because it is considered a humanitarian step,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The Head of State also rejected the possibility of returning the occupied Crimea by force. The President explained that Ukraine's proposals in negotiations with Russia on Crimea do not mean that the topic of deoccupation of the peninsula will not be raised for 10-15 years. On the contrary, according to him, the agreement should stipulate that during this period the parties must resolve the issue of Crimea through diplomacy. ""The proposed format is not to solve it now, but to solve it at least tomorrow, during this period. I think this is not a bad decision. But I think so now. Today, if there were such agreements on Crimea, I believe this would be a victory for Ukraine,"" the President said."
The unification of local authorities has made it possible to significantly strengthen the defense of our state - President of Ukraine,2022-04-05T13:39:00Z,"The central government has made great efforts to ensure that the heads of regional state administrations form joint teams with mayors and representatives of law enforcement agencies at the local level, and this has significantly strengthened the defensive position of our state. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an interview to the Ukrainian media. ""We must openly say that we were all working on it. Strongly, with calls, with screams. However, these teams have emerged. And their cities can be proud of them today, and there are no questions to them,"" the Head of State said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that some mayors failed to demonstrate resilience during the war, but thanks to teamwork, they returned to full duty. ""We united these teams, many mayors came to their senses and started working in three or four days. And then they said: sorry, we were really just not ready. We talked in a human way, today everything is fine,"" he said. The President noted that many heads of regional state administrations have now become professional ""war managers"". ""No head of the regional state administration ran anywhere. Honestly, I don't think we had such a staffing approach. But it turned out that these people are just powerful. And they are all on the ground, all heads of regional state administrations,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. According to the Head of State, some leaders of territorial communities have shown themselves to be strong and courageous people and even gave their lives for our homeland. ""Unfortunately, we lost several of them. They were killed. They were tortured. After the war, we will sit down and at the regional level will tell how many calls with such people we had, how many things happened as it was. How they deceived the enemy, it was daily. ""Several times we ""buried"" these people, took them out, then brought them in so that they could appear in the squares as a symbol for the people that they are there,"" the President said. He stressed that the mayors had become ""flag people"" who supported the inhabitants of the communities during the difficult times of the war. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also noted that many business representatives also stayed in Ukraine and supported citizens and the military on a volunteer basis. ""I am very grateful to all these people, no matter what business they represent - small, medium, large. All the same, they are doing great,"" the Head of State said. However, he noted that there were also entrepreneurs who went abroad allegedly for the sake of one or another activity, allegedly for the sake of Ukraine. According to the Head of State, Ukrainian oligarchs also showed various qualities during the war. ""They behaved differently. We will draw conclusions when we win. Someone suddenly became a hero, and someone ceased to be a strong man,"" the President concluded."
"President of Ukraine: We must continue negotiations with Russia, pointing out all the crimes committed by it and seeking responsibility",2022-04-05T12:30:00Z,"Despite all the crimes committed by the Russian army against civilians in the suburbs of Kyiv, Ukraine must continue negotiations with the Russian Federation, as other Ukrainian cities are under occupation, where civilians are also blocked. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an interview for the Ukrainian media. The Head of State noted that after exposing the crimes of the occupiers in Bucha, Irpin and other towns in the Kyiv region and realizing the scale of the tragedy, both Ukrainian authorities and citizens will see as a challenge even the possibility of negotiations with the aggressor, not to mention their content. ""Everyone understands that what they did is unforgivable. We need to know that,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. Nevertheless, according to the President, it is necessary to find strength and continue negotiations. ""Every such tragedy, every such Bucha will just make it harder as regards any negotiations. And here we still need to find opportunities for such steps. We want to have a stronger position at these talks,"" he said, noting that the support of Ukrainian society, which is also a powerful weapon, is important here. According to the Head of State, the authorities should take into account not only the positions of the Armed Forces, but also those people who were blocked in places of active hostilities and temporarily occupied settlements. Then there will be no question of whether someone wants negotiations or not - the question of their necessity and the strength of the parties at the negotiating table arises. ""Just saying today that we will not talk about anything anymore is the easiest position. The easiest thing to say is that I will not talk to you, and it is clear why, after what you have done. The most difficult thing is to say what they did, to recognize them as enemies, to know that this is specifically Russia's war against Ukraine. Admit it all. We believe that this is genocide, we believe that they must all be punished. But we have to find opportunities to meet. And at the meeting to find a way out of this situation and at the same time not to lose our territory,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. Regarding the prosecution of all those involved in crimes against civilians in Ukraine, the President assured that the state is already working on it. ""We will definitely do that. Relevant lists will be compiled. We live in a civilized world, and therefore there is an order that will be ensured in accordance with law and international law. The day before yesterday, we agreed to set up a joint commission with the European Union,"" the President said. He said that he had discussed this issue with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, whose visit to Kyiv is expected in the near future. ""Prosecutors of different states, a joint commission will deal with all these crimes. There is a separate case of ours against these criminals who tortured our people. We are starting to gather this information. We will look for all these people,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy added. To clarify how Ukraine will ensure that the killers are prosecuted, the President said that the commission has already been established, the Prosecutor General and a representative of the President's Office will join its work. ""I do not see any more mechanisms. I believe that the internal Ukrainian mechanism, which my colleagues and I started talking about, will be very effective, because there are people who really want to find these criminals. I think we will find the right format. If international law does not resolve this issue, Ukrainian law will find a way out of this difficult situation, of this tragedy,"" he said. The Head of State also predicts that the amount of evidence and testimony about crimes committed by the Russian army against civilians will increase, as the liberation of other temporarily occupied cities of Ukraine is ahead. ""There will be no fewer of them, because Izyum is still ahead, there are many things we have no access to. Occupied Melitopol, Berdyansk. We have no idea what happened there. We'll find this procedure. There will be an action plan. There are no secrets here, because we openly say: we will do it. It doesn't make sense to keep secret how we will find these people,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy summed up."
"There is ample evidence that it is Russian troops who destroy peaceful cities, torture and kill civilians - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-04-05T00:38:00Z,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today has been a really difficult day. Emotional. I've visited our cities in the Kyiv region, which we liberated from the occupiers. Stoyanka, Irpin, Bucha. Of course, now this area does not look like yesterday. The bodies of killed people, killed Ukrainians have already been taken from most streets. But in the yards, in the houses, the dead still remain. The cities are simply ruined. Burnt military equipment on the roads, destroyed cars. It is especially hard to look at the traces of bullets on cars with the inscription ""Children"". We have just begun an investigation into all that the occupiers have done. At present, there is information about more than three hundred people killed and tortured in Bucha alone. It is likely that the list of victims will be much larger when the whole city is checked. And this is only one city. One of the many Ukrainian communities that the Russian military managed to seize. There is already information that the number of victims of the occupiers may be even higher in Borodyanka and some other liberated cities. In many villages of the liberated districts of the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions, the occupiers did things that the locals had not seen even during the Nazi occupation 80 years ago. The occupiers will definitely bear responsibility for this. We are already doing everything possible to identify all the Russian military involved in these crimes as soon as possible. Everything to punish them. This will be a joint work of our state with the European Union and international institutions, in particular with the International Criminal Court. I discussed this issue today with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. And also with Chancellor of Austria Nehammer. We agreed on his visit to Ukraine in the near future. I also discussed the investigation into the war crimes of Russian troops with Polish President Duda. We also talked about new sanctions against Russia, humanitarian and defense cooperation with Poland. All crimes of the occupiers are documented. The necessary procedural basis is provided for bringing the guilty Russian military to justice for every crime they commit. I would like to emphasize that we are interested in the most complete, transparent investigation, the results of which will be known and explained to the entire international community. We provide maximum access for journalists to Bucha and other liberated cities of Ukraine. For hundreds of journalists from around the world. And we are interested in having thousands of journalists there. As many as possible! For the world to see what Russia has done. I'm sure you know about the new old tactics of Russian propagandists who are constantly trying to reject accusations of the Russian military. Why the new old? Everything is simple. Because they used the same tactics when the occupiers shot down a Malaysian Boeing over Donbas. They blamed Ukraine. They even came up with various conspiracy theories. They even went so far as to claim that the corpses were ""thrown"" on board the plane before it crashed. Now they are doing the same thing. The same lies. They are trying to distort the facts. But, as then, they will not succeed. They will not be able to deceive the whole world. The time will come when every Russian will learn the whole truth about who of their fellow citizens killed. Who gave orders. Who turned a blind eye to the murders. We will establish all this. And make it globally known. It is now 2022. And we have much more tools than those who prosecuted the Nazis after World War II. We must also be aware that after the revealed mass killings of civilians in the Kyiv region, the occupiers may have a different attitude to their crimes in another part of our country where they came. They are already launching a false campaign to conceal their guilt in the mass killings of civilians in Mariupol. They will do dozens of stage interviews, re-edited recordings, and will kill people specifically to make it look like they were killed by someone else. Probably, now the occupiers will try to hide the traces of their crimes. They did not do this in Bucha when they retreated. But in another area it is possible. I want to say right away: every normal person in the world understands who brought war and mass deaths to Ukrainian land. There is ample evidence that it is Russian troops who destroy peaceful cities, abduct, torture, kill civilians. Therefore, Russian propagandists and their leaders can now succeed in only one thing: making their work enough for the verdict of the future tribunal, which will be similar to the verdict of Julius Streicher, one of the ideologues of Nazism, editor-in-chief of the Der Stürmer weekly. He was executed for anti-Semitic propaganda and calls for genocide. Nowadays people are not executed already. But all skabeevas, evening loudmouths, frontline liars and their bosses in Moscow should remember: the end of your life will be behind bars. At best. I would also like to note the reaction of the leaders of the democratic world to what they saw in Bucha. The sanctions response to Russia’s massacre of civilians must finally be powerful. But was it really necessary to wait for this to reject doubts and indecision? Did hundreds of our people really have to die in agony for some European leaders to finally understand that the Russian state deserves the most severe pressure? This breaks the heart of every Ukrainian. It breaks my heart. Because only now do we hear from all world leaders statements that should have been made long ago, when everything was already completely clear. I emphasize once again: Ukraine must get all the necessary weapons to drive the occupiers out of our land as soon as possible, to liberate our cities. And if we had already got what we needed - all these planes, tanks, artillery, anti-missile and anti-ship weapons, we could have saved thousands of people. I do not blame you - I blame only the Russian military. But you could have helped. I will continue to say this to the face of all those on whom the decision on weapons for Ukraine depends. We have already started preparing all the necessary work to restore normal life in the liberated areas. Mine clearance of the territory is carried out. Our sappers neutralize thousands of explosive devices every day! In the near future we will restore electricity supply, restore water supply to this whole territory of our state. We will provide medical care, normal access to goods - as much as possible in the current conditions. Of course, we will rebuild the destroyed and damaged housing. We will rebuild roads, bridges, infrastructure. Life will come again to every city, to every community that the occupiers tried to destroy. This week I continue to address the parliaments of the nations of the world. Today was Romania. I thanked the Romanian people for their warm attitude towards our migrants. It's true. I called for greater sanctions against Russia. I also said that Romania's leadership was indispensable for ensuring security in the Black Sea region and for restoring justice in Europe as a whole. Tomorrow I will address the Spanish Parliament. And also the UN Security Council. Today I expressed condolences to the President of the Republic of Lithuania and to the entire Lithuanian people over the brutal murder of the world-famous documentary filmmaker Mantas Kvedaravičius by the Russian occupiers in Mariupol. In 2016, he made a film about our peaceful Mariupol, which shortly before found itself on the frontline of the war in Donbas. And now it was there that his life was taken. May the memory of him live forever! We continue to prepare for even more brutal activity of the occupiers in the eastern and southern directions. We know what they are going to do in Donbas. We know what they are going to do near Kharkiv, in some other parts of the country. Russia concentrates a significant amount of military and equipment there. And this activity proves that sanctions imposed against Russia are not enough. There will be more. If the Russian leadership does not begin to really seek peace, really negotiate peace, they will put their country in the worst condition in 50 years. The so-called wicked 90's will seem prosperous and calm. And traditionally, before delivering this address, I signed a decree awarding our Ukrainian heroes. 152 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine received state awards, three of them posthumously. Eternal glory to all our heroes! Eternal memory to everyone who perished for our country! Glory to Ukraine!"
Ukraine is an integral part of Europe and the democratic world and deserves to be at the center of the European security system - Head of the President's Office,2022-04-04T22:36:00Z,"Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak is convinced that today no one has any doubts that the Ukrainian state is a full-fledged part of Europe and deserves to be at the center of an effective European security system. He said this in an interview for Natalia Moseichuk on 1+1 TV channel. ""I believe that there is no adequate person who is not convinced that Ukraine is part of Europe, a democratic world and today is actually a fortress, which protects not only itself but all the values of the democratic world,"" said Andriy Yermak. He noted that today tens of thousands of people take to the streets of Berlin, Paris and other cities in Europe and the world having already made their choice regarding their attitude towards our country. The Head of the President's Office is convinced that 14 years ago at the NATO summit in Bucharest, a very big historical mistake was made when specific Allied countries and specific leaders started a game with Russia. ""Then it was possible to make a historic decision that could have prevented this heinous war, but it did not happen,"" he said. Andriy Yermak is convinced that today Ukraine, which has been directly holding back one of the world's largest armies for more than a month, could strengthen any alliance. ""But we need it today - not tomorrow. There is no time. Otherwise we will build a new system. Today we are not just knocking on the door. Today we simply demand, we deserve it - to be at the center of the security system of our region, Europe,"" said the Head of the President's Office. He noted that now the priority for Ukraine is to end the war and create a new security system in the world, because the effectiveness of the existing one is doubted. Andriy Yermak noted that Ukraine will never consider any compromises concerning independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty. ""It is unacceptable for us. And there is a position of the state that today Ukraine must return to internationally recognized borders,"" he said. According to the Head of the President's Office, there are issues that need to be resolved in the negotiations now: the withdrawal of Russian troops and the return to the situation as of February 23, 2022, so that these are truly full-fledged talks - not under the gun. At the same time, the issues with the temporarily occupied territories of Donbas and Crimea also need to be resolved. ""These are separate issues that should also be the subject of negotiations today, and they are the subject of negotiations,"" Andriy Yermak said."
Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Romanian Parliament,2022-04-04T21:26:00Z,"Dear Mr. President of the Chamber of Deputies! Dear Mr. President of the Senate! Dear Mr. Prime Minister! Ladies and gentlemen, deputies and senators, guests! Dear friends! Romanian people! I am grateful for this opportunity to address you and all your people. A few hours ago I returned from the liberated cities of the Kyiv region - near our capital. It is these territories from which we expelled the Russian occupiers and saw what they had been doing to the Ukrainian people on our land. And I want you to see it now. What the occupiers left behind. I apologize - the video is brutal, but it's a reality... The name of our city of Bucha is now forever in world history. In the history of war crimes. In the history of the extermination of people. As of now, we know about more than 300 civilians tortured, executed or otherwise killed in Bucha. Ordinary residents of an ordinary city near Kyiv. Their hands were tied behind their backs, they were shot in the back of the head or in the eye, killed just in the streets. Civilian vehicles were crushed by military equipment. Vehicles with people! They raped women and girls... And this is just the beginning of the investigation. Not all evidence has been collected yet. Not all burials have been discovered yet. Not all basements where the Russian military tortured people have been inspected yet. There is every reason to believe that the number of killed residents of Bucha and other Ukrainian cities nearby will be much higher than what we know today. Why did the Russian military do that? On the same day, April 3, when the world was horrified to see the bodies of those killed in Bucha, an article justifying the genocide of Ukrainians was published on the website of the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. Its name is quite eloquent, I quote: ""What should Russia do with Ukraine"". And it's not just text. This is one of the proofs for the future tribunal against Russian war criminals. The article describes a clear and calculated procedure for the destruction of everything that makes Ukrainians Ukrainians and our people themselves. Those whom they will not be able to break and conquer. It is said that ""de-Ukrainization"" and ""de-Europeanization"" of Ukraine should be carried out. It is said that even the name of our state should be erased. Virtually, it is said that the deaths of as many of our people in the war are only welcomed. I want to emphasize once again: this is the website of the state news agency of Russia, where, under conditions of explicit state censorship, only materials that correspond to the official ideological position on the war against Ukraine can be published. What does not correspond to such a position would simply not pass censorship. I want you to understand me: they are not even hiding. They openly speak about the purpose of the invasion of Ukraine. If our army had not withstood, if our people had not risen to the defense of the state, they would have done what they did in Bucha - but throughout Ukraine. We know about the deliberate killings of teachers and educators in the temporarily occupied territories. We know about deliberate terror against all those whom the occupiers considered as activists, as people related to the army. Even the mere presence of the national symbols of Ukraine, the state flag or coat of arms, in a person's apartment was already a reason for the occupiers to kill this person or at least threaten to kill him or her. But why aren't they hiding? Why do they even now, when everything is clear to the world, openly say how they want to destroy the whole nation? There are two answers to this question. You will understand the first answer very well. In 1989, Nicolae Ceaușescu finally ended his life. For many years it has been clear that this man had lost his adequacy. It has been clear that he, his wife, his entourage, his ""Securitate"" have been dragging your country and people down - to suffering, to poverty, to isolation not just from the world, but from everything advanced in the world. That regime relied only on intimidation, repression, brutality and deception. There was nothing bright in it. The Romanian people revolted and defended themselves, saved themselves. Having overthrown inadequate power. Because that was the only way. Ceaușescu, his wife, his entourage, his ""Securitate"" could not be convinced of anything. It is also impossible to convince those who promote war in Russia now. Who give criminal orders. Who develop plans for the genocide of the Ukrainian people and the destruction of the Ukrainian state. These people are inadequate. They have lost all connection with reality and are willing to sacrifice millions of lives to realize their crazy ideas. And the second reason why Russia is openly calling for genocide and why the crimes of the occupiers that everyone in the world saw in Bucha are possible is the belief of Russia's top officials that European leaders will fail, will be weak. That Europe will lack leadership. And that the nations of Europe are incapable of defending the values that have united the continent. Ladies and Gentlemen! Great Romanian people! Together we must stop these inadequate people who are accustomed to impunity and therefore decided that they are allowed absolutely everything. Together we must stop those who want genocide in Europe. Why must we do this together? Each of you understands that Ukraine is not the last target of Russian aggression. Troops of occupiers are stubbornly trying to bypass our city of Mykolaiv to try to seize Odesa. And from Odesa there is one step to Moldova. Russian state propagandists have long said that Moldova is also a target for Russian expansion. Therefore, the defense of Ukrainians of their own state is a fundamental prerequisite for security and independence of Moldova. And therefore a prerequisite for peace in the whole large region of the Danube. Now the fate of the whole of Eastern and Central Europe and the Black Sea region is being decided on the territory of Ukraine. Therefore, to protect the freedom of Ukraine, to protect the freedom of Ukrainians is to guarantee the security of Europe. What must be done? Yes, it is true, sanctions were imposed on Russia for this war. But the war for our freedom has been going on for 40 days already. After 8 years of war in Donbas. Therefore, sanctions are not enough. Russia must seek peace with Ukraine and with the whole of Europe. To this end, Russia must be deprived of all resources. First of all, financial and economic ones. The European Union must finally adopt a principled decision and close ports to Russian ships. Stop the transit of goods and any economic activity with Russia. Restricting the flow of money for Russian energy has no alternative. One can argue about what the format should be: a full embargo on supplies or a program like ""Oil-for-Food"" - but it is necessary. And not only that. Every politician in a democratic world must defend the need to provide Ukraine with all the necessary weapons. Because it is on the battlefield that it is decided who will be the winner in this war - freedom or tyranny. Everyone on whom it depends must do everything possible to quickly and inevitably bring to justice all Russian servicemen and their commanders guilty of committing crimes against civilians in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. Today, I reached an agreement with the European Union on the provision of financial and technical support to the Eurojust Joint Investigation Team, EU member states and the International Criminal Court. I believe that Romania's leadership will be one of the decisive factors in restoring justice and protecting normal life both in our region and in Europe as a whole. I am confident that Romania and Romanian companies will also take part in Ukraine's post-war reconstruction program. We invite our partners in Europe to take patronage over a city, region or industry that has suffered from Russia's aggression. Your potential, your inner strength can create a new example of leadership in building a civilized and peaceful life. I am sincerely grateful to all the Romanian people for their kind treatment of Ukrainian immigrants who have found safety on your land. I hope that together we will be able to create such conditions as soon as possible, when Russia will give up the war, and so our people will be able to return home to Ukraine. And this experience of assistance in emergency situations, mutual respect, kindness between our people has already become the basis for even greater rapprochement of our states, our nations. As soon as the situation allows, I want to start a dialogue with you on a new comprehensive agreement that guarantees the absolute protection and development of our national minorities - the Ukrainian community in Romania and the Romanian community in Ukraine. Because our destiny is to be as close as we can. Our destiny is to be defenders of freedom in our region. Our destiny is to be together in the European family. And I believe that very soon I will be able to address you with words of gratitude for Romania's support for Ukraine's accession to the European Union. Thank you very much! Glory to Romania! Glory to Ukraine!"
Andriy Yermak: The crimes committed by the Russian military in Bucha are genocide,2022-04-04T18:59:00Z,"The crimes committed by the Russian military against civilians in the Ukrainian cities of Bucha, Irpin, Hostomel and other settlements in the Kyiv region are genocide of the Ukrainian people. This was emphasized by Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak in an interview for Natalia Moseichuk on 1+1 TV channel. According to him, the true scale of the crimes of Russian troops in the occupied suburbs of the capital can be estimated when full information is available. But it is clear that this cannot be compared to the massacre in Srebrenica, one of the largest war crimes in modern European history committed during the 1995 Bosnian war. ""It's a completely different story. One nuclear power attacked a non-nuclear power. This is Russia's war against Ukraine, so I would not make such comparisons. But in terms of horror and absolutely inhuman treatment it's real genocide, one hundred percent,"" he said. Andriy Yermak said that every day he communicates with his colleagues - political advisers in the United States, Germany, Great Britain and other countries and informs them in detail and provides photo evidence of the crimes of the Russian occupiers against Ukrainians. ""Shock reaction. I am convinced that they should feel what all Ukrainians feel today. Because the decisions we expect depend on many of them,"" he said. Answering the question whether he has received calls from any Russians apologizing for what their country is doing to Ukraine, the Head of the President's Office said: ""They must apologize to the entire Ukrainian people. But I don't think it will be accepted today. And this is for many, many years. There is no excuse for what we see today, what we feel. And, unfortunately, all this continues - we have not stopped this war yet."""
Delaying the negotiation process by Russia will have negative consequences for it - President of Ukraine,2022-04-04T18:24:00Z,"Peace in Ukraine is impossible without victory, and victory can be achieved through diplomacy in parallel with the fighting of the Ukrainian army. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a conversation with international and Ukrainian journalists in Bucha, Kyiv region. The Head of State noted that the Foreign Ministers of Ukraine and Russia met in Turkey, but the meeting ended in vain. He stressed that the delay in the negotiation process by Russia will have negative consequences for this country. ""Every day, when our troops come in and deoccupy certain territories, you see what is happening. It's very difficult to talk when you see what they've done here. Every day people are found there in barrels, in cellars, strangled, tortured. Therefore, we believe that if they have something to think with, they need to think faster,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. The President expressed conviction that peace would be established in Ukraine in any case, because our modern European country cannot live in war. ""We strive for peace, we deserve it. And these people showed it, and the Armed Forces showed it. Peace is impossible without victory. Victory can be achieved in a diplomatic format in parallel with the fighting steps of our army. Our army demonstrates its fighting steps on a daily basis, but it is not easy. We do not want to lose millions of people. That is why there should be dialogue,"" the Head of State said."
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy already has a plan for Ukraine's economic revival on the table - Andriy Yermak,2022-04-04T17:41:00Z,"The restoration of Ukrainian cities will begin immediately after their liberation from the Russian occupiers. A plan for Ukraine's economic revival has already been prepared. This was announced byHead of the President's Office Andriy Yermak in an interview for Natalia Moseichuk on 1+1 TV channel. ""The President already has a plan for economic revival on the table. We do not waste a single day, we are thinking and getting ready as regards how we can start today. I think that the reconstruction of cities will begin immediately after their release,"" Andriy Yermak said. He noted the great unity of the country that is observed now: Ukraine is no longer divided into west and east or on the basis of language. ""Today we are really making history - the history of a great nation, a great country,"" said the Head of the President's Office. Therefore, according to him, all the negative phenomena, such as corruption, excessive bureaucracy and bloated state apparatus, should remain in the past. The Ukrainian economy must become human-centered, and the state must guarantee justice. ""We will rebuild the cities. The worst thing is that we will not bring back the people who were killed. There is nothing more precious than human life. And we will rebuild everything else, we will rebuild it quickly,” Andriy Yermak is convinced. The Head of the President's Office also supported the idea of creating a large memorial to honor all those whom Ukraine lost in this war with the Russian occupier."
"Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Bucha, where he talked to local residents and journalists",2022-04-04T17:05:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the city of Bucha in the Kyiv region, where mass killings of civilians took place during the occupation by Russian troops. The Head of State visited the humanitarian aid center and talked to local residents. Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk told the President about the humanitarian situation in the city, the progress of the search for the bodies of the dead, the assessment of the damage caused by the occupiers to private and communal property, and the pace of reconstruction of the city. Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded Anatoliy Fedoruk with the Order of Courage of the III Degree. The Head of State also spoke with international and Ukrainian journalists who came to Bucha to document Russia's war crimes. ""It is very important for us that journalists are here. We want you to show the world what was happening here, what the Russian military was doing, what the Russian Federation was doing in peaceful Ukraine,"" the President said, addressing the media. As Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted, what the Russian occupiers did to this modern town is genocide. ""These are war crimes and they will be recognized by the world as genocide. We are aware of thousands of people killed and tortured, with their limbs cut off. Raped women, murdered children. I believe this is genocide,"" the President said. In addition, the President watched the road with destroyed equipment of the Russian army, as well as the destroyed bridge across the Irpin River on the M-06 Kyiv – Chop highway. The President noted that part of the bridge over the Irpin River will be repaired and opened in a few months. Preparations for the construction of a temporary crossing have now begun. It will be opened in about two weeks, said Minister of Infrastructure Oleksandr Kubrakov. According to him, full-fledged movement of one passage of the bridge can be started in two months, both passages - in three or four months. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also visited the destroyed bridge over the Irpin River on the R-30 highway. It will take ten days to build a temporary crossing here, and a full-fledged repair will take two to three months."
Volodymyr Zelenskyy initiates creation of a special mechanism to help bring to justice those involved in crimes against the Ukrainian people,2022-04-03T22:21:00Z,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has approved a decision to create a special mechanism of justice in Ukraine to investigate and prosecute every crime of the Russian occupiers in our country. “The essence of this mechanism is the joint work of national and international experts: investigators, prosecutors and judges. This mechanism will help Ukraine and the world bring to concrete justice those who unleashed or in any way participated in this terrible war against the Ukrainian people and in crimes against our people,” the Head of State informed  According to the President, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Office of the Prosecutor General, the National Police, the Security Service, intelligence and other structures within their competence must make every effort to ensure that this mechanism works immediately. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also called on all Ukrainian citizens and friends of Ukraine in the world to join this work and help establish justice. “The world has already seen many war crimes. At different times. On different continents. But it is time to do everything possible to make the war crimes of the Russian military the last manifestation of such evil on earth. Everyone guilty of such crimes will be included in a special Book of Torturers, will be found and punished,” the President noted. In addition, the Head of State noted that all partners of Ukraine will be informed in detail about what was happening in the temporarily occupied territory of our state. “War crimes in Bucha and other cities during the Russian occupation will also be considered by the UN Security Council on Tuesday,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized."
It is time to do everything to make the war crimes of the Russian military the last manifestation of this evil on earth - address by the President of Ukraine,2022-04-03T21:22:00Z,"Today this address will be without greetings. I do not want any extra words. Presidents do not usually record addresses like this. But today I have to say just that. After what was revealed in Bucha and our other cities the occupiers were expelled from. Hundreds of people were killed. Tortured, executed civilians. Corpses on the streets. Mined area. Even the bodies of the dead were mined! The pervasive consequences of looting. Concentrated evil has come to our land. Murderers. Torturers. Rapists. Looters. Who call themselves the army. And who deserve only death after what they did. I want every mother of every Russian soldier to see the bodies of the killed people in Bucha, in Irpin, in Hostomel. What did they do? Why were they killed? What did the man who was riding his bicycle down the street do? Why were ordinary civilians in an ordinary peaceful city tortured to death? Why were women strangled after their earrings were ripped out of their ears? How could women be raped and killed in front of children? How could their corpses be desecrated even after death? Why did they crush the bodies of people with tanks? What did the Ukrainian city of Bucha do to your Russia? How did all this become possible? Russian mothers! Even if you raised looters, how did they also become butchers? You couldn't be unaware of what's inside your children. You couldn't overlook that they are deprived of everything human. No soul. No heart. They killed deliberately and with pleasure. I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being fulfilled. Such orders. Such a fulfillment. And joint responsibility. For these murders, for these tortures, for these arms torn off by explosions that lie on the streets. For shots in the back of the head of tied people. This is how the Russian state will now be perceived. This is your image. Your culture and human appearance perished together with the Ukrainian men and women to whom you came. I approved a decision to create a special mechanism of justice in Ukraine for the investigation and judicial examination of every crime of the occupiers on the territory of our state. The essence of this mechanism is the joint work of national and international experts: investigators, prosecutors and judges. This mechanism will help Ukraine and the world bring to concrete justice those who unleashed or in any way participated in this terrible war against the Ukrainian people and in crimes against our people. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Office of the Prosecutor General, the National Police, the Security Service, the Intelligence Service and other structures within their competence must make every effort to ensure that the mechanism is operational immediately. I call on all our citizens and friends of Ukraine in the world who can join this work and help establish justice to do so. The world has already seen many war crimes. At different times. On different continents. But it is time to do everything possible to make the war crimes of the Russian military the last manifestation of such evil on earth. Everyone guilty of such crimes will be included in a special Book of Torturers, will be found and punished. Ukrainians! I want you to realize that. We drove the enemy out of several regions. But Russian troops still control the occupied areas of other regions. And after the expulsion of the occupiers, even worse things can be found there. Even more deaths and tortures. Because this is the nature of the Russian military who came to our land. These are bastards who can't do otherwise. And they had such orders. All partners of Ukraine will be informed in detail about what happened in the temporarily occupied territory of our state. War crimes in Bucha and other cities during the Russian occupation will also be considered by the UN Security Council on Tuesday. There will definitely be a new package of sanctions against Russia. But I'm sure that's not enough. More conclusions are needed. Not only about Russia, but also about the political behavior that actually allowed this evil to come to our land. Today is the fourteenth anniversary of the NATO summit in Bucharest. Then there was a chance to take Ukraine out of the ""gray zone"" in Eastern Europe. Out of the ""gray zone"" between NATO and Russia. Out of the gray zone, in which Moscow thinks they are allowed everything. Even the most dreadful war crimes. Under optimistic diplomatic statements that Ukraine could become a member of NATO, then, in 2008, refusal to accept Ukraine into the Alliance was hidden. The absurd fear of some politicians towards Russia was hidden. They thought that by refusing Ukraine, they would be able to appease Russia, to convince it to respect Ukraine and live normally next to us. During the 14 years since that miscalculation, Ukraine has experienced a revolution and eight years of war in Donbas. And now we are fighting for life in the most horrific war in Europe since World War II. I invite Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy to visit Bucha and see what the policy of concessions to Russia has led to in 14 years. To see with their own eyes the tortured Ukrainian men and women. I want to be understood correctly. We do not blame the West. We do not blame anyone but the specific Russian military who did this against our people. And those who gave them orders. But we have the right to talk about indecision. About the path to such Bucha, to such Hostomel, to such Kharkiv, to such Mariupol. We have no indecision. No matter whether we are in a certain bloc or non-aligned, we understand one thing: we must be strong. Fourteen years ago, Russia's leader in Bucharest told Western leaders that there was no country like Ukraine. And we prove that there is such a country. It was and it will be. We will not hide behind the strong of this world. We will not beg anyone. Honestly, we shouldn't have asked for help with weapons to protect ourselves from this evil that came to our land. All the necessary weapons should have been given to us anyway - without requests. Because they themselves realized what evil had come and what it had brought with it. We see what’s at stake in this war. We see what we are defending. There are standards of the Ukrainian army - moral and professional. And it is not our army that has to adjust now. These are many other armies that should learn from our military. And there are standards of the Ukrainian people. And there are standards of the Russian occupiers. This is good and evil. This is Europe and a black hole that wants to tear it all apart and absorb. We will win this war. Even if individual politicians are still unable to overcome the indecision they will pass on to their successors together with their offices. And all the necessary services are already working in Bucha to bring the city back to life. Restore electricity supply, water supply. Restore the work of medical institutions. Rebuild the infrastructure. Give security to people. Because Russia was expelled. And Ukraine is returning. And brings life back. Today I visited our border guards, our heroes in the hospital of the Border Guard Service of Ukraine. Wounded warriors. I presented state awards to the eight of them. I also awarded the orthopedist-traumatologist - medical service officer who is a leading military traumatologist in Ukraine and has already saved many Ukrainian defenders. In total, 41 border guards received state awards under this decree. It was the servicemen of the State Border Guard Service who first met the occupiers with fire when they went on the offensive on February 24. Now our boys and girls are returning to the state border as we expel the occupiers. I am sure the time will come and the whole line of the state border of Ukraine will be restored. And for this to happen sooner, we must all be focused, ready to boldly face evil and respond to every criminal act against Ukraine, against our people, against our freedom. Evil will be punished. Glory to Ukraine!"
President paid a visit to the wounded border guards at the Main Military Medical Center and presented state awards,2022-04-03T17:29:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy paid a visit to the wounded border guards undergoing treatment at the Main Military Medical Clinical Center. This medical institution of the State Border Service provides assistance to wounded border guards with injuries of varying severity. Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke with Head of the State Border Service of Ukraine Serhiy Deyneko and the management of the clinical center, inquired about the needs in the medical field and the measures taken to help defenders during the war. For personal courage and selfless actions in defense of the state sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, loyalty to the military oath and in accordance with decrees, the President presented state awards to eight border guards from various units. They were wounded in battles for Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Hostomel, as well as in clashes with enemy sabotage groups. In addition, the state award was given to an orthopedist-traumatologist of a medical institution. The medical service officer is a leading military traumatologist in Ukraine and conducts complex surgeries, saving the lives and health of defenders. The servicemen were awarded medals ""For Military Service to Ukraine"" and ""Defender of the Homeland"". "
Do everything you can for us to withstand together in this war for our freedom and independence - address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-04-03T00:05:00Z,"Ukrainians! Strong people of the indomitable country! Another day of our defense has passed. Another day of many that are gradually, with difficulties, but steadily bringing us closer to peace. To peace that no one will give us a gift. We need to understand it clearly. Because there are no subjects in the world that can stop wars and give peace. The global security architecture has failed. Peace for us will not be the result of any decisions of the enemy somewhere in Moscow as well. We should not cherish empty hopes that they will simply leave our land. We can only gain peace. We can gain it in hard battles and in parallel - in negotiations, and in parallel - in daily vigorous work. Therefore, each of us must continue to do everything we can. In all directions. To support our Armed Forces. To preserve and develop economic activity in Ukraine - as much as possible now. To support all our citizens... Wherever they are, whoever they are. In peacetime warm words sustained the vital forces. And in wartime it is even more important. When we may not even know what a person is going through. What a loss. What help a person needs. But we can see that a person needs help. We need to support this person. We should at least hear this person. Say a few kind words. Something needs to be done to support the life of this person. This must be done. You should be attentive to everyone around you! When people defend themselves in a war of annihilation, when there is a question of the lives or deaths of millions, there are no unimportant things. There are no unimportant moments. Everything matters. And everyone can contribute to the victory of all. Someone with a weapon in their hands. Someone - at work. And someone - with a warm word and help at the right time. So do everything you can for us to withstand together in this war for our freedom, for our independence. For Ukraine to live. Due to such sincere and constant support of each other, due to unity and attention to the neighbor, the people can overcome the most difficult challenges. And drive out the enemy, which is many times bigger in numbers. Our defenders continue to regain control over communities in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions. There are more and more Ukrainian national flags in the areas that have been temporarily occupied. The Armed Forces of Ukraine do not release the invaders without a fight. Inflict fire damage. They are destroying everyone we can reach. We are strengthening our defenses in the eastern direction and in Donbas. We are aware that the enemy has reserves to increase pressure in the east. What is the goal of Russian troops? They want to capture both Donbas and the south of Ukraine. What is our goal? Protect us, our freedom, our land and our people. Do everything for protection. Our heroic Mariupol continues to hold back a significant part of the enemy forces. Thanks to this resistance, thanks to the courage and resilience of our other cities, Ukraine has gained invaluable time. The time that allows us to undermine the enemy's tactics and weaken their capabilities. Unfortunately, Ukraine has not yet received enough modern Western anti-missile systems. Has not received aircraft. Hasn't received what the partners could provide. Could - and still can! Every Russian missile that hit our cities and every bomb dropped on our people, on our children only adds black paint to the history that will describe everyone on whom the decision depended. Decision whether to help Ukraine with modern weapons. I would like to thank the residents of our Enerhodar separately. Those brave Ukrainians who went to a rally today to defend their city. To protect our state. In response, the occupiers opened fire and used grenades against completely peaceful people, which are on their land, within their law. There will be an answer for each wounded person. And the Ukrainian character cannot be conquered by any pressure or violence. I am grateful to everyone who takes to the streets in the temporarily occupied cities. To all who are not afraid and go out. I am grateful to all who are afraid and come out. To all those who feel that without this decision to defend Ukraine and their freedom, the occupiers can gain a foothold. And when people protest - and the more people protest - the harder it is for the occupiers to destroy us, to destroy our freedom. This is our common struggle! And it will be our common victory. I would also like to say a few words to those politicians, some deputies of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine who absolutely do not understand what is happening in the hearts of our people. They don't understand it so much that they even decided to change the national anthem. I have a question for these people: what have you done in your life to give you the moral right to change the words of the anthem? Are you outstanding poets? Maybe you excelled in the battles for Ukraine? Or now is such a time that you can change the anthem whenever you want? Cool down emotions. Stop pretending to be fools. I believe that the authors of these and other similar bills, proposals, should take up arms and go to the battlefield, if you have these opportunities. Only there will you understand something. And even if they accidentally vote for something like this, I still will not sign such bills. Don't waste time. I want to turn to another person who does not seem to fully understand what is happening. Not only in Ukraine, but throughout Europe. To the Prime Minister of Hungary. He is virtually the only one in Europe to openly support Mr. Putin. We did not ask for anything special from official Budapest. We didn't even get what everyone else is doing! Doing for the sake of peace. We did not receive the vital transit of defense aid, we did not see moral leadership. We saw no effort to stop the war! Why so? The whole of Europe wants peace. The whole of Europe does not want the battlefield to be moved from Mariupol to Budapest or from Kharkiv to Krakow or from Chernihiv to Vilnius. The whole of Europe is trying to stop the war, to restore peace. Then why is official Budapest opposed to the whole of Europe, to all civilized countries? For what? The main thing for us is the opinion of the people. The Ukrainian people support the Hungarian people. The Hungarian people support the Ukrainian people. We value peace equally, we value freedom equally. It will always be so. We will always live in good neighborliness. And I am convinced that our minorities should be the bridges that unite us even more. Politicians come and go. And the truth remains. That's what I'm talking about - the truth. And I always say what I think. When I am speaking of Hungary, I mean Hungary. And I don't need to mask my thoughts. If we need to speak of Germany, we are speaking of Germany. If I need to speak of another country, I'm speaking of another country. If it's a war, then I call it a war, not a ""special operation."" If this is a threat to the whole of Europe, then I call it a threat to the whole of Europe. This is called the honesty that Mr. Orban lacks. He may have lost it somewhere in his contacts with Moscow. I spoke today with the President of Colombia. I am very grateful to him for his support and solidarity with Ukraine. The list of countries that honestly say that freedom matters and the war must stop is expanding. I also spoke with British Prime Minister Johnson. A meaningful, pleasant conversation. We agreed on new defensive support for Ukraine. New package. Very, very tangible support. We also agree on the strengthening of sanctions against Russia. Extremely tangible. Agreed on joint steps to achieve peace. Thank you Boris for the leadership! Historical leadership. I'm sure of it. In the afternoon I held a large meeting with the economic bloc of the Cabinet of Ministers and the Office of the President. The economic frontline is another direction of our struggle for our state, for our people. We discussed in great detail the situation with sowing, with the supply of food to Ukrainians, with the supply of fuel, the situation in the energy sector, the situation with the main sectors of the state. The Minister of Finance reported on the state of implementation of the state budget, details of negotiations with partners on financial support for Ukraine. In wartime, economic relations must remain one hundred percent managed, no matter how difficult it may be for all of us. Because it's about perspective. About the perspective of life for more than 40 million Ukrainians, about what our tomorrow will be like. The participants of the meeting received clear tasks. And finally. Already traditional. I signed a decree on state awards to our heroes - the heroes of our state. 131 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, nine of them - posthumously. Eternal glory to them all! Eternal glory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all our defenders!  Glory to Ukraine!"
Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a meeting on the development of the Ukrainian economy in wartime,2022-04-02T16:05:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a meeting with the economic blocs of the Office of the President and the Cabinet of Ministers. The parties discussed the state of the Ukrainian economy in the second month of our country's resistance to Russia's military invasion, as well as considered forecasts for its development in the near future. According to the Ministry of Finance, the Ukrainian state spends about $ 10 billion a month on hostilities. The sources of expenditure financing were discussed at the meeting, including own tax revenues and assistance from Ukraine's international partners. In the same context, the prospects for the transition to a simplified taxation system scheduled for April were touched upon. The participants of the meeting also discussed the sowing campaign, in particular the provision of fuel to farmers. Ways to diversify fuel imports and protect Ukraine's energy infrastructure from Russian military bombing were discussed."
Europe has no right to react in silence to what is happening with our Mariupol - address by the President of Ukraine,2022-04-02T01:17:00Z,"Ukrainians! Our dear defenders! This day, April 1, the occupiers decided to mark with two equally silly jokes. One such joke is about people in Russia. They started the spring conscription, which looks traditional, but is still different from the usual. Because this year's conscripts can be sent to war against our state, against our people. So, this is a guaranteed death for many very young guys. And although they are not our citizens, although they are citizens of the state that is at war with us on our land, it is still our duty as people to warn. Warn each such conscript, their parents. We don't need more dead people here. Save your children so that they do not become villains. Don't send them to the army. Do whatever you can to keep them alive. At home. At their home. The Russians won't be told the whole truth about this conscription and about the fate of the conscripts. But still, if you can convey the truth to them - do it. I want to dwell on the fact that the Russian Federation is trying to take people into the army in Crimea. This is a violation of international humanitarian law and a war crime for which there will be responsibility. And which is also an argument for increasing sanctions against Russia. That's why I want to tell the people of Crimea: sabotage this story. At any stage. And if it doesn't work out, don't fulfill criminal orders and surrender to the Armed Forces of Ukraine at the first opportunity. We will understand everything. You will live. The occupiers played a second very silly April Fool's joke with some residents of the southern regions of Ukraine, where Russian troops had temporarily entered. They appoint some ""Gauleiters"", some temporary leaders. And they are threatening employees of enterprises and authorities to cooperate with these deceived appointees. My message to them is simple: the responsibility for collaboration is inevitable. Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow is a secondary issue. The main thing is the inevitability that justice will be restored. Therefore, everyone who became a Gauleiter can already register somewhere in Rostov. And there will be problems for cooperation with them or with the occupiers directly. This is the last warning. The occupiers are withdrawing forces in the north of our country. The withdrawal is slow but noticeable. Somewhere they are expelled with battles. Somewhere they leave positions on their own. After them a complete disaster and many dangers are left. It's true. Firstly, the bombing may continue. Secondly, they are mining all this territory. Mining houses, equipment, even the bodies of killed people. Too many tripwire mines, too many other dangers... We are moving forward. Moving carefully. And everyone who returns to this area must also be very careful! It is still impossible to return to normal life as it was. Even in the areas we return after the fighting. You will have to wait. Wait for our land to be cleared. Wait until you can be assured that new shelling is impossible. In the east of our country, the situation remains extremely difficult. The Russian militaries are being accumulated in Donbas, in the Kharkiv direction. They are preparing for new powerful blows. We are preparing for even more active defense. We use all opportunities - both internal and external. Necessarily. I emphasize once again: hard battles lie ahead. Now we cannot think that we have already passed all the tests. We all strive for victory. But when it comes everyone will see it. Everyone will feel that peace is coming. In the afternoon I spoke with President of France Macron. About the humanitarian situation in the Ukrainian cities shelled by the occupiers. The situation in Mariupol was discussed separately. For which, I hope, there may still be a solution. Europe has no right to react in silence to what is happening in our Mariupol. The whole world must react to this humanitarian catastrophe. Today humanitarian corridors worked in three regions - Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia. 6,266 people were rescued. In particular, 3,071 people from Mariupol. We are separately agreeing on the removal of the wounded and dead from the city. Our military, our civilians - all citizens. We are talking about this with Turkey as a mediator. Hopefully I will be able to report the details soon. In the afternoon I met with President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola. Met in Kyiv. I am grateful to her for this important visit, which demonstrates to some other politicians that courage at a time like this is one of the most important traits for a politician. We talked about how to accelerate Ukraine's accession to the European Union. There are specifics. We also talked about arms supplies and support of European parliamentarians in this. And also about the sanctions policy. About a deeper sanctions policy against Russia. Because if there is an embargo, then it is an embargo. If there is SWIFT, then it is for all banks. And if it is business with Russia, it is not just a suspension of activities, but a complete withdrawal of European companies from the Russian market. Traditionally, I signed a decree on awarding our defenders. Seven servicemen of the State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection. Two of them - posthumously. Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Eternal gratitude to our defenders! And finally. Tomorrow, April 2, Ukrainian Muslims together with all Muslims of the world will celebrate the holy month of Ramadan. Sincere prayers, mutual forgiveness and good deeds characterize this month. But in Ukraine, another virtue is added - loyalty to brothers-in-arms and your people in battles. In the battles for the freedom of Ukraine. In our war for independence. In which we will definitely win. We will definitely achieve peace. For our entire land. I sincerely wish you peace! Everyone. The whole of Ukraine! All the people of the world. Glory to Ukraine!"
President of Ukraine met with President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola in Kyiv,2022-04-02T00:36:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola who arrived in Kyiv. The interlocutors discussed the coordination of European parliaments in support of Ukraine. ""I would like to sincerely thank you personally, Roberta, and all your team for the fact that at such an important moment for our country, when Ukrainians believe in deeds and concrete steps, you demonstrate heroism to come to Ukraine. And today it is heroism,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, adding that this visit is an important step in support of Ukrainians. The Head of State noted that the result of his previous phone conversations with Roberta Metsola was her appeal to MEPs and the world community to support Ukraine, and this is highly appreciated by the Ukrainian people. ""You have led a country of extremely brave men and women fighting for freedom and democracy. I came to Ukraine not only to confirm our solidarity, not only to continue working on the wording of our resolutions, in which we say that Ukraine is part of our European family, because you are fighting for us, for fundamental principles that the European continent has upheld for centuries. I would also like to make sure that you have everything you need to win this war. Because if you win, the whole world will win,"" said Roberta Metsola. She also said that she would like to give Ukrainians who have fled the war and found refuge in other European countries a new perspective that they will return to beautiful Ukraine. The Ukrainian Head of State spoke about the situation on the frontline and stressed the importance of continuing and intensifying sanctions pressure on Russia. He pointed out that some sanctions turned out to be just a formality, and ""holes"" were quickly found in some of them. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that new sanctions packages should appear weekly and be painful for Russia until it gives up aggressive actions. At the same time, sanctions pressure on Russia must be reinforced with the defensive support for our state. According to the President of Ukraine, the world must put pressure on Russia to force it to sit down at the negotiating table and seek peace. But this will not happen if the Russian Federation continues to feel impunity for any of its actions. Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke, in particular, about Russia's blockade of navigation in the Black Sea. According to him, this threatens global food security and may result in high prices for the exported Ukrainian agricultural products. Finally, the Head of State awarded Roberta Metsola the Order of Princess Olga of the I degree for a significant personal contribution to the consolidation of international support for Ukraine in countering Russian aggression."
"The world must learn to live without Russian energy, through which Russia finances the terrible war in Ukraine - Oleh Ustenko and Simon Johnson",2022-04-01T18:29:00Z,"The European Union, the United States and its allies are already working to block Russia's cash flow from energy exports as the Kremlin's main source of geopolitical influence. This is stated in a joint article by Adviser to the President of Ukraine on Economic Affairs Oleh Ustenko and former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, Professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management Simon Johnson for Project Syndicate. The authors note that Russia occupies a significant place in world energy markets. It supplies 40% of the gas consumed in the European Union and also exports about 2.85 million barrels of petroleum products such as diesel and aviation fuel. “These fossil-fuel exports have enabled Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its extreme violence against unarmed civilians and civilian infrastructure. Russian President Vladimir Putin apparently believes that no one can stand up to him because of the naked power that he can exert through energy markets. If the Europeans resist too much, he will cut off their gas. If the rest of the world cuts back on their purchases from Russia, the price of oil will rise – causing economic difficulties everywhere,"" the article reads. But, according to the authors, Vladimir Putin underestimated the horror his invasion of Ukraine would create, especially in Europe. The European Union will certainly no longer risk its national security by importing Russian energy. Both the United States and the EU have all the tools they need to stop Russia from being a leading player in world energy markets. “Some EU countries are already de facto boycotting Russian oil. According to TankerTrackers.com, in February, Denmark imported just over 7.5 million barrels of crude oil from Russia by ship. But in the first 27 days of March, Denmark imported no Russian crude whatsoever. Sweden, Finland, and other countries also reported big declines in Russian crude imported by tanker. And there are increasing signs that Germany and other countries will step up to lead a full and immediate embargo on imports of Russian oil by tanker into the EU,” the article reads. Also, according to the authors, the possibility of paying for Russian gas and oil to escrow accounts, specially frozen accounts is being considered - to ensure the euro proceeds cannot be used by Russia to buy weapons anywhere in the world. “Putin attempted to get ahead of this development by demanding payment for gas only in rubles, but the EU has rebuffed this as a breach of contract. Germany and Austria are preparing to ration the use of gas,” the authors noted. They also point out that it will be difficult for Vladimir Putin to reorient oil exports from the European to the Asian market. After all, as the example of oil sanctions against Iran shows, if the United States, the EU, Great Britain and Norway impose sanctions banning all forms of marine insurance for tankers carrying Russian oil and refined products, most of the world's tanker fleets will be withdrawn from the Russian market. “The Russians have their own tankers, of course, but their fleet is too small to move more than about one million barrels per day, particularly because a lot of the crude would need to be hauled from Murmansk, the Baltic Sea, or the Black Sea all the way to Asia. Some renegade operators may attempt to enter the business, but these activities would be tracked carefully, and ship owners, charterers, and captains would most likely face personal US and EU sanctions,” the article reads. For its part, Ukraine has already indicated it will pursue all possible remedies against anyone complicit in the financing of war crimes. “Once the world adjusts to living with much less Russian energy, there will be no going back. No European in their right mind wants nuclear-armed Russia to have the free cash flow that its hydrocarbon exports currently provide, because that money will allow Putin (or his successors) to rearm and become even more aggressive – perhaps attacking NATO countries next time. There is no such thing as “cheap” Russian oil and gas,” Oleh Ustenko and Simon Johnson concluded."
All military-industrial complex enterprises must work non-stop today - Andriy Yermak at a meeting with Ukroboronprom Director General,2022-04-01T13:35:00Z,"Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak discussed with Director General of Ukroboronprom Yuriy Husyev the work of the concern under martial law. During the meeting, they focused on key aspects of the functioning of Ukroboronprom, identified areas that need special attention. ""Today, all enterprises of the military-industrial complex must work 24/7. To repel Russia's aggression, the Armed Forces of Ukraine need effective work of every employee in the industry,"" Andriy Yermak stressed."
Andriy Yermak: Ukraine has proved to everyone that it is an important player that needs to be respected,2022-04-01T13:26:00Z,"Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak noted that today Ukraine is not only defending itself from Russian aggression - it is protecting the whole European world. So Europe must help. He said this in an interview to leading international media - The New Yorker, Bild and Le Monde. Andriy Yermak said that the position of Russian troops in the Kyiv direction is currently changing, but ""we can believe that only when they leave our country."" The Head of the Office of the President also said that the blockade of the city of Mariupol is continuing. There, people are dying without food and water, and the Russian side is not opening humanitarian corridors to evacuate residents. Instead, the Russians are trying to force people to go to Russia under the pretext of the only way to survive, as stated by Andriy Yermak. ""Mariupol is blocked. They are ready to completely destroy Mariupol just to take it under control,"" he added. According to the Head of the President's Office, given that Russian forces continue to bomb settlements in Ukraine, including civilian infrastructure, the Ukrainian government insists on closing the skies over our country to Russian aviation, but at the same time considers this issue in a realistic manner. Andriy Yermak emphasized: “If you hear from NATO officials every day that this will not happen, we are not even told ""this is a debatable issue"", but only ""it will never happen""... What to do then? We are realists. We give our partners some way out. We continue to offer our partners - it's not just the war between Ukraine and Russia, we protect you. If something happened in Chornobyl or at ZNPP, it would be 10 times bigger than in Chornobyl, and the population of Europe would have to be evacuated. And all the nations of the world would ask their governments: ""What are you doing?"" According to the Head of the Office of the President, from the very beginning of the presidential term, Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his team did their best to change the perception of Ukraine: from a country that constantly asks for something, to a country with which one should speak on an equal footing. ""And today we have been fighting for 36 days against one of the strongest armies in the world. We have proved to everyone that we are an important player who will have to be respected by everyone,"" said Andriy Yermak. He noted that before the Russian invasion, world leaders had ignored Ukraine's calls for preventive sanctions, which, along with military aid, would be a major deterrent to the aggressor and could affect the situation before the war. ""We continue to talk about sanctions and turned to my good friend Michael McFaul for an analysis of sanctions. We analyze each sanction - how it works, where we are fooled, where they have learned to circumvent these sanctions. These are sanctions that must be effective quickly. Today there is a war, we pay the highest price - we pay with human lives. There is no time for lyrics and delays when our people are being killed,"" said the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine. Today, thanks to international restrictive measures against Russia and the successful deterrence of armed aggression by the Ukrainian army, Russia has moved from the language of ultimatums to dialogue, although this dialogue is difficult. According to Andriy Yermak, Ukraine has always been in favor of dialogue and wants to achieve peace the most. But there are fundamental issues on which compromises are impossible. ""In Zelenskyy's time, Ukraine will not give away a single centimeter of our territory. If Zelenskyy had been President in 2014, we would not have lost Crimea. Because everything started the same way - then and now,"" he said. According to the Head of the President's Office, Ukraine, with its struggle for European values, freedom and justice, has once again proved that it deserves to take a worthy place among European countries. Today, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has become the leader of the free world, and the entire Ukrainian nation is a true hero. ""Some nations of the world are ready for more than their politicians. People do not believe in excuses why it is now impossible to do everything necessary for Ukraine to be a member of the EU,"" said the Head of the Office of the President."
"We all equally want to win, but there will be battles ahead - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-04-01T00:05:00Z,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! The 36th day of our nationwide defense after eight years of war in Donbas is coming to an end. It's hard to believe that, but March has already passed. Absolutely imperceptible! The passage of time is somehow not even noticed. Every day and every night has become virtually the same for us. The same day, the same night. And with one task for all - to protect ourselves, save people, rebuff invaders. Drive them out. All this March and five days of February, the invaders have been trying to break in and gain a foothold in our house from different directions - from land, from the sky, from the sea. They go, fly, swim... There is so much evil in them, so much thirst for destruction that it reminds not of people, but of something otherworldly. Some monsters that burn and loot, attack and try to kill. Some hellish chimeras. But when you are on your land, everything helps you. The land itself, rivers, every person. Everyone, even the one you didn't expect from before. We endured much more than the enemy expected. They said - three or five days. They thought that this would be enough for them to seize our entire state. And it’s already 36. And we are standing. And we will continue to fight. Until the end. Until we have strength and opportunities. So that there are no monsters left on our land. So that if chimeras (points to the House with Chimeras - ed.), then native and good. The ones protecting us. I am sure that it is extremely pleasant for each of you to read and watch the news that Ukrainian cities are gradually being liberated from the occupiers. And so it is. Our Armed Forces, the National Police and the National Guard, intelligence are doing great. Absolute gratitude to them! To the north of Kyiv, in the Chernihiv direction, in the Sumy region, the expulsion of the occupiers continues. They themselves are aware that they can no longer withstand the intensity of hostilities they could have maintained in the first half of March. But we must also realize that for the Russian military, this is part of their tactics. All this is not occasional. We know their plans. We know what they are planning and what they are doing. We know that they are moving away from the areas where we are beating them to focus on others that are very important. On those where it can be difficult for us. That is why it is very important for everyone to show restraint. Restraint in emotions. Restraint in worries. We all equally want to win. Equally! But there will be battles ahead. We still have a very difficult path to cover to get everything we strive for. Of course, everyone should motivate our military, each other, and support our defense. Children - with ""likes"". Parents - with a warm word. Volunteers - with help. The people and the state - with all the resources and opportunities that we have, that are available in Ukraine. Restraint in emotions, readiness to fight until we win and proper motivation for our military are essential elements. I also work on motivation for them. Daily. Like each of us. As always, before delivering the address, I signed a decree awarding our heroes. 136 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Thank you to everyone! And today another decision was made. Regarding antiheroes. Now I do not have time to deal with all the traitors. But gradually they will all be punished. That is why the ex-chief of the Main Department of Internal Security of the Security Service of Ukraine Naumov Andriy Olehovych and the former head of the Office of the Security Service of Ukraine in the Kherson region Kryvoruchko Serhiy Oleksandrovych are no longer generals. According to Article 48 of the Disciplinary Statute of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, those servicemen among senior officers who have not decided where their homeland is, who violate the military oath of allegiance to the Ukrainian people as regards the protection of our state, its freedom and independence, will inevitably be deprived of senior military ranks. Random generals don't belong here! And to the real heroes of the Security Service - the same absolute gratitude, just as to each and everyone who sincerely defends our state. There are really a lot of heroes among the servicemen. We are grateful to them! The situation in the south and in Donbas remains extremely difficult. The invaders are allocating their sick creativity to the temporarily occupied areas of the Kherson region. They are trying to organize some of their incomprehensible structures there, they are trying to figure out how to consolidate their presence there. Of course, this is hopeless for them. The more active they are there, the more substantial the losses of Russia itself will be in the end. The losses of Russians themselves. Because who else will pay for the occupation of a foreign land? Also in Donbas, in Mariupol, in the Kharkiv direction, Russian troops are accumulating the potential for strikes. Powerful strikes. We will defend ourselves. We will do everything we can to stop the occupiers and clear our land of their evil and foolish chimeras. Today I addressed the parliaments of our partner countries: Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium. I felt total support. I am waiting for concrete steps. I called for tougher sanctions against Russia. We have to put pressure on the aggressor until the aggression is over. I also spoke about this with President of the European Council Charles Michel. We need more support from our partners right now. When the Russian military is concentrating additional forces in certain areas. In addition to sanctions, we discussed with Charles Michel economic support for Ukraine, financing of priority projects. The dynamics of our movement towards full membership in the EU. The sanctions policy was one of the topics of conversation between Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak and US National Security Advisor Jacob Sullivan. The United States has imposed a new package of sanctions against Russia. We are grateful. It will not allow the current sanctions to be circumvented - we have already noticed such attempts. It will also limit the work of sensitive sectors of the Russian economy - its defense sector. Let Moscow not forget that the sanctions policy will only be continued and intensified. As long as there is no peace - sanctions are needed. Until Russia begins to invest as sincerely in the search for peace as it invests in the destruction of our state, sanctions will remain unalterable. I also held talks with President of Turkey Erdoğan today. We spoke very specifically. In particular, about the prospects of negotiations in Turkey with the Russian Federation. And also about the creation of an effective system of guarantees for our state. About the security we have always needed and to the real provision of which we have come closer. I am grateful for Turkey's readiness to become a guarantor of security for Ukraine. And finally. Both I and government officials have already said that the ""Diia"" state service has started accepting applications for compensation for the destroyed real estate of our citizens. The state will return to our people everything that the occupiers destroyed - houses, apartments, etc. In a few days, 25,491 applications have already been submitted. The number of residents in these houses and these apartments, which were destroyed, according to our estimates is 63 thousand 471 people. But we know that more needs to be restored. Much more. So tell everyone who needs it about such a government program. An important program. The opportunity to submit applications will soon be available offline, in the administrative service centers, in the mode usual for many Ukrainians. No matter what, we all have to think about the future. About what Ukraine will be like after this war. How we will live. Because this is a war for our future. This is a war for our lives, in which we have only one way - to gain peace for Ukraine. To gain Ukraine's security. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"
Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Federal Parliament of Belgium,2022-03-31T16:55:00Z,"Dear Mrs. President of the Chamber of Representatives! Dear Mrs. President of the Senate! Dear Mr. Prime Minister! Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, deputies and members of the government! Dear Belgian people! Eight years of war. 36 days of full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation. Did many people expect that our state and our people would be able to resist Russian troops for so long? Let's be honest: no. Few. They thought we would fall under the blows of Russian troops. But we withstood. Our people endured. We are fighting. We are defending our freedom, amazing the world with the courage of Ukrainian heroes, our Armed Forces of Ukraine and all citizens of Ukraine who do not surrender, who believe in victory. In the south of our state there is a city of Mariupol, which you mentioned today. I am very grateful to you, Madam Speaker. One of the most promising and economically powerful cities in Ukraine. That was before this war. And now more than 90% of all buildings in this city are completely destroyed by Russian strikes - aircraft, artillery, mortars, tanks. Thousands of peaceful Mariupol residents died. People are buried just in the city. In the courtyards of high-rise buildings. Or rather, what is left of the high-rise buildings. Mariupol has been under complete blockade for more than three weeks. The Russian military closed all entrances to the city and blocked access from the sea. You all know these details, there is nothing in the city: no water, no food, no medicine, no life. There is nothing you need to sustain any life. But Mariupol does not give up. Mariupol continues to fight the occupiers. Its defenders had a choice - they could leave the city and give it to the Russian invaders. They did not. Every day we try to do everything to make the humanitarian corridors from Mariupol work! To save civilians who still remain in the city. Women and children, the elderly… In part, we succeed. But in most cases, the Russian military does not release people into the free territory of Ukraine. And does not allow any humanitarian cargo into Mariupol. Today it is the most horrific place in Europe. It is hell. It is a catastrophe that everyone knows about, the whole world. But no one is determined enough to help stop the catastrophe in this city and in other cities in our country. And now I want to ask everyone - I want to ask you, I want to ask all Europeans who hear me now. What do the defenders of Mariupol hope for? What do the defenders of other cities, towns and villages of Ukraine hope for? In all those areas where the battles are no less appalling than you had near Ypres. Or maybe it's even worse in Mariupol... I don't know. Do the defenders of our cities hope for the closure of the skies over Ukraine to Russian missiles and aircraft? They know there is no courage to do so. Do they think about whether our state meets the criteria for joining the European Union? Our state, which has already given thousands of lives in the war for freedom in Europe... Do Mariupol residents or defenders of any other city in Ukraine calculate the level of losses of European companies from the termination of business in the Russian market? Do they think about money at all? No. They do not hope for it. Do not calculate it. Because that's exactly what they deserve. Agree, these are completely different worlds. The world of those who really fight for freedom. Here and now. Against tyranny. Against a tyranny that wants to split Europe and destroy everything that unites us. Everything that unites you... And the world of those who are so used to freedom that they don't even want to notice what the struggle for it is worth. The world of those who believe that Russian diamonds in Antwerp, for example, are more important than the war in Eastern Europe. Or the world of those who believe that the accessibility of European ports to Russian ships is more important than the Russian military machine's attempt to destroy the entire nation around you. 40 million Ukrainians! The main question in the life of every person is not what this person hopes for, what this person thinks or calculates... The main question is what this person is worthy of. And I, as the President of a worthy country, address you with quite logical statements. With what is clear to the vast majority of the world, Europe, Europeans in different countries. We have seen these polls, we know how people support us. Our defenders deserve to receive from Europe for the freedom of which they are fighting the weaponry that will definitely stop Russia's offensive, and therefore the onset of tyranny. When we are talking about aircraft, tanks, artillery systems, anti-ship weapons, we are talking about what is really needed. And what the countries of the European Union, the countries of NATO have. Our defenders deserve that European companies finally stop making money together with those who are trying to destroy us. Our defenders deserve not to think about the criteria, but to know that Ukraine will be a member of the European Union. Because if they lose, if we lose Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities, there will be no strong European Union anymore. Because tyranny will come to take away from you everything you possess and are proud of. Of course, we do not wish you this. And this is by no means a threat. This is the reality. We feel it. This is a statement of all the facts we live in. A statement of what is clearly visible from Mariupol - the headquarters of the European resistance. Of what is clearly visible from Ukraine - the headquarters of European dignity. And I am sure that those esteemed headquarters that are located on your beautiful land are fully aware of everything I am telling you. They realize it. Although, perhaps, they do not speak aloud. So let us all together in Europe be worthy of the feats that Ukrainians demonstrate in the war for freedom. For a free Europe and against tyranny. Against Russia. We are grateful to you, very grateful to your state for the support you have already provided. Belgium was one of the first to provide us with defensive assistance. This is a historical moment, a historical gratitude. We will never forget that. You have already warmly welcomed more than 30,000 Ukrainians who left their homes because of this war. But it is you, as the heart of Europe, who can inspire all other Europeans to do more. To help us drive the occupiers out of Ukraine and restore the precious peace. Peace that is worth more than anything, more than any values, more than any diamonds. More than any agreements with Russia. More than any Russian vessel in European ports. More than any barrel of Russian oil. Each of you knows what needs to be done to restore peace. To be truly worthy of Europe. So help us, do it! Weapons. Sanctions. EU membership. And soon the future will thank you. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to the heroic city of Mariupol! Thank you sincerely to your state! Glory to Ukraine!"
Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the States General of the Netherlands,2022-03-31T13:31:00Z,"Mrs. Speaker! Dear members of parliament! Mr. Prime Minister! Mark! Dear Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Defense! Dutch people! I have the great honor of becoming the first foreign head of state to address the House of Representatives of the Netherlands and your people. In this format, at such a time. I am sincerely grateful for this opportunity. For the fact that in these critical circumstances in which my country and our entire continent found themselves, I can explain to you directly what is happening and why it is so important to be together now for all of us, for all Europeans. For all who value peace on our planet. Peace for which millions of people have fought, generations of Europeans. And which was destroyed by one decision, in one moment. So much has been done since World War II so that what Ukraine is experiencing right now never happens again. But everything repeats. Unfortunately. Only so far for one European country, not for the whole continent. But World War II began with the destruction of individual states as well. And then it led to the tragedy of Rotterdam, the terrible bombing of London and the massacre that engulfed all of Europe. If peace on the continent had not been preserved, if the great war had returned with no less brutality than 80 years ago, no one could have a reason to believe that certain state borders would manage to deter aggression. Especially since many in Russia want to carry this aggression further, further to Europe. The shadow of those ruins of Rotterdam is already hanging over many European cities. Ukraine is just the beginning, if Russia isn't stopped. If we don't stop it immediately! 36 days! 36! That is how long our state, our people have already been fighting alone against the army, which was considered among the strongest in the world. Russia has been preparing for this campaign against us, against freedom, against our people for decades. They have accumulated as many resources to spend on war, on death, as not every European country can spend on life. And now these Russian resources are working at full capacity and, by the way, tirelessly. They work in such a way that... No matter how scary it may sound, people are already getting used to it. The world is beginning to adapt. They start to ignore everything they hear about the war. They are getting used to the news about the new bombing of our peaceful cities. About new missile strikes. They are getting used to the updated lists of those killed. Daily reports of the number of destroyed houses and shelled cities and communities no longer evoke emotions. For many others, the war in Ukraine is becoming routine. Unfortunately, this is true. Routine. But not for those whose lives are in danger every minute. Who, as residents of our city of Mariupol, has been under complete blockade for more than three weeks already. Without everything: without life, without food, water, basic medicines, without communications. Who is forced to stay in basements, hide anywhere just so as not to die under fire. But not for those whom Russia has taken to its territory. Simply deported, as the Nazis did in the occupied countries. Thousands of Ukrainian children and tens of thousands of adults were forcibly transported to the territory of the occupying state. Unfortunately, we do not know anything about the fate of most of them. How to return them? Will they lose touch with their relatives? Will Russia give back these people, these children? These are horrible questions for us. And for some it is becoming a routine that one should not even pay attention to. We are now at a time when we need to act even faster, even more powerfully than during the first month of the war. When the peoples of Europe, the peoples of the world saw what Russia was doing. And they are all full of indignation, full of desire to help. It's true. But people's attention and emotions do not focus on the same thing for long. If the situation is not resolved, people may switch to something else. We have no right to give this war another 36 days! We must all work together to make Russia seek peace as soon as possible! Hundreds of children were killed. Thousands of people were killed. Tens of thousands of houses were destroyed. Burned cities, villages. Russian occupiers rape women in occupied areas. They loot everything they can, everything they find. They even kill not to achieve any military success anymore. Not to sow terror. They started killing because it is fun for them! Entertainment for people who have as many weapons as they want and no deterrents. We will never accept this! And we will never stop defending ourselves! Ladies and Gentlemen! Dutch people! I know that tomorrow your country will celebrate 450 years since the beginning of the armed uprising against tyranny. A fundamental event for your state, for your society. Under normal circumstances, in my address to you, I would talk about it as you are used to hearing it. As about history, a historical moment. As about your heritage. As about the achievements of generations of people who lived 450 years ago. But today, as my country struggles against tyranny, I will speak about it solely as about a current event, as about something that must happen here and now. The faster the better. What was the goal of the founders of the Netherlands? Obviously: freedom, democracy, human dignity, cohesion, cultural, religious diversity. Since then, the path to everything that shows modern Europe has continued. To the free life of dozens of different nations together - in a single space. To tolerance, which provides an unprecedented level of human respect for each other in human history. And all this is now under attack again. All this now needs to be defended again. To be defended in the east of Europe, to be defended in our state, in Ukraine. So far only in Ukraine… So far there is a chance to stop the tyranny on our land and drive it back, beyond our Ukrainian border. I am grateful to you, politicians, I am grateful to all ordinary people for the extremely strong support of my state, our people at this time. For leadership in sanctions. For the principled stance in business activity related to the Russian Federation. For the help you provide to Ukrainian immigrants who have felt family care in your society. This is all extremely valuable! But Russia does not cease hostilities on the territory of Ukraine. Exactly on the territory of Ukraine. And we have to do much more to restore peace. To protect freedom. To save us as a state. And to really ensure one vital fact: there will never be another war in Europe. Never again! In 2014, the world did not fully understand why the Russian occupiers came to our land. Then - to the land of Crimea, partly - to the land of Donbas. And you felt it. After they shot down a Malaysian Boeing flying from Amsterdam. There can be no doubt that this is a totally unjust war. This is a war that the Russian state cannot be forgiven. Hundreds and hundreds of crimes for which everyone must be held accountable. All those who gave criminal orders. Everyone who carried out these criminal orders. And all those who provided political cover for these criminal orders. Your city, The Hague, the capital of international justice, knows exactly how to do it. I'm sure they will do it! To assert international law. To assert the rule of law. To assert justice that is clear to everyone on Earth. But for that to happen, sanctions need to be stepped up. Together with other EU countries, you have to do everything possible so that Russia does not have the resources to continue this war, the war in Europe, and so that there is no political opportunity to hide criminals. Close your ports to Russian ships! Together with all other EU countries. Stop any trade with this country that has forgotten all the lessons of World War II! Get ready faster to give up Russia's energy resources, so that billions, billions of euros for them do not go to arms production and mass killings in Ukraine. Ladies and Gentlemen! Dutch people! Tyranny must lose. Tyranny must always lose. And for that to happen, freedom must get all the weapons it needs to win, to defend itself. The weapons that are available on the continent. The weapons you have. Ukraine is grateful for the support it has already received from you. From your society. From your state. This support is truly unprecedented. It is truly the support of a leader. But the war is so intense, Russian troops are so active that we need more. ""Stingers"" and ""Panzerfausts"" allow you to hold on, to fight. However, this is not a weapon of victory. We desperately need weapons that can make our skies safe, that we can use to unblock our cities where Russia is artificially creating famine. We need weapons that can drive the occupiers out of our land. Aircraft, tanks, NASAMS air-defense systems and Spike anti-tank systems, shells, missiles and more. You have this list. And I hope you will find an opportunity to help us as much as you can, to help us with that. The second point. I urge you to influence international institutions! The crimes of the Russian occupiers must be punished. Deportations, massacres, destruction of civilian infrastructure, bombing of hospitals - all this must be answered by the democratic community. Imagine: Russian troops are deliberately destroying our agricultural sector! They are mining fields, they are blowing up agricultural machinery now. They are doing everything to destroy our potential, agricultural potential, and provoke a food crisis. Not only in Ukraine - in the world. And they are doing it in a country that could become one of the most powerful agricultural centers in Europe and the world. But I am confident that we will be able to overcome all this. I am confident that together we will be able to build even more potential. And become a truly global agricultural power. Third. We already have to think about rebuilding Ukraine. About how we all - not only Ukrainians, but all Europeans - will return to a peaceful life. I dream of this day. The day when Ukrainian immigrants who arrived in the European Union after the beginning of the Russian aggression will be able to say ""thank you"" and return home. Return to rebuilt cities, to restored Ukraine. And I invite your country to join this project - the project of reconstruction of Ukraine. I urge you to choose a city, a region of our state that can see your care, can feel what you can do. And for everyone in your country who still has doubts to definitely feel that we, Ukrainians, can be with you - in the European Union. I am convinced that this will reinforce our common European home. And will make the European project even more perfect. I believe that this will happen very soon! Because it is absolutely rational. With our potential, with our people, with our ability to defend freedom. And you know this perfectly well! And you know very well, my friend Mark, that our accession to the European Union depends very much on you, on your country. I want to thank you for everything! Thank you, the Netherlands! Glory to Ukraine!"
Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Australian Parliament,2022-03-31T11:38:00Z,"Distinguished Mr. Prime Minister! Dear Mr. Speaker of the House of Representatives! Dear Mr. President of the Senate! Dear leader of the opposition! Ladies and gentlemen, members of the government, senators and members of the parliament! Australian people! Thank you for the great honor of speaking to you today. In May 2016, thousands of Australians gathered at Perth Airport to see the Ukrainian ""Mriya"" for the first time. ""Mriya"" is the name of our An-225 aircraft. ""Mriya"" is a dream in English. After covering almost 15,000 kilometers, it delivered to Australia an urgent cargo - a 130-ton electric generator, which your enterprise desperately needed. Delivery by sea would take several months. And the Ukrainian plane did it in a few days. We have always been proud of our ""Mriya"". Not because it is the largest on the planet. First of all because it helped people from all over the world by delivering food, drinking water, equipment for peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. In 2019, after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, our ""Mriya"" constantly delivered the most necessary medical supplies. That saved people. Adults, children - all. In different countries, on different continents. ""Mriya"" was bringing life. But now it is impossible. Impossible, because there is a state that has completely different values than we have, than you have, than the whole civilized world has. And this state started a full-scale war against us. It bombs and shells peaceful cities and villages, killing our peaceful people. Kills children. Arranges blockades of cities, holding hundreds of thousands of people hostage without water, food, light and heat. Daily. It separates thousands of children from their parents and takes them out, or rather kidnaps them, forcibly relocating to its territory. And on February 27, as a result of fighting in the city of Hostomel, our plane ""Mriya"" was burned. Can we say that Russia has destroyed our dream? No. It burned the plane, it burned the iron. It destroyed matter, not soul. The shell, not the essence. Not freedom. Not dignity. Not independence. We know that our dream cannot be defeated and destroyed. Especially if we can count on the support and help of the free world. On your support, on your help. And as in the story I told above, it is not needed in a few months, it is needed now. Ladies and Gentlemen! Australian people! The distance between our states is great, thousands of kilometers. We are divided by the seas and oceans, the territories of dozens of other countries, time zones. But this distance simply does not exist for the cruelty and chaos that Russia has brought to Eastern Europe, to the region of our Black and Azov Seas, to our Ukrainian land. Everything that is happening in our region due to Russia's aggression and that is destroying the lives of our people has already become a real threat to your state and your people. Because this is the nature of evil - it can instantly overcome any distance and any barriers. Destroy life. For decades, there has been no such threat of nuclear strikes as there is now. Because Russian officials and state propagandists are openly discussing the use of nuclear weapons against those who do not want to obey Russian demands. For decades, it has not been the case that one state completely blocked the sea for another state and all merchant ships of any country. But that is exactly what Russia has done. Our part of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov is now a completely dead sea. And any ship that tries to enter our waters can simply be destroyed by the Russian fleet. More than a hundred merchant ships under various flags are blocked by Russia in our ports! For decades, there has never been a state in the world that has started a war against a neighboring people, openly declaring its conquest or destruction. So that not even the name of this nation remains, so that there is no possibility of free life for this nation. Russia has already returned to the world the worst pages of the XX century. The greatest threats of that century. It returned the evil that humanity has long hoped to forget. But the worst thing is that if Russia is not stopped now, if Russia is not brought to justice, some other countries in the world that dream of a similar war against their neighbors will decide that this is possible for them as well. The fate of global security is being decided now. No human is capable of controlling the wind and precipitation on the planet, and therefore no one will be able to save one or another part of the Earth from radiation pollution due to the use of nuclear weapons. No state on the planet should have even a theoretical possibility to block maritime trade routes and even more so to completely close the sea to other states. I repeat once again: there should not even be a theoretical possibility! No ruler in the world should count on impunity when considering the prospect of war. Ladies and Gentlemen! Australian people! After 36 days of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine, it is safe to say that there is no other way in the world to guarantee global security than to force Russia into silence, into peace. And also to bring it to justice - this is important - for everything it has done against global security. A state that does not shy away from nuclear blackmail should immediately receive sanctions that demonstrate that blackmail has devastating consequences for the blackmailer. Effective tools are also needed to bring to justice any state that blocks maritime trade routes. So that no one even has such a temptation - to make the sea dead. Now there are simply no such tools in the world. Therefore, Australia's leadership can be indispensable in modernizing the global security architecture. As well as in strengthening our anti-war coalition, which is now working to return peace to Ukraine. It is also necessary to improve the capacity of international institutions created for the responsibility of war criminals and those who commit any criminal act for which the whole world can punish in solidarity, not just one state alone. If this was done in time, life in the world would be much safer. I am sure that each of you, as well as each of us Ukrainians, remembers the tragedy of MH-17. Malaysian Boeing shot down by the Russian occupiers in the sky over the Ukrainian Donbas. Then 298 people died. My condolences to all the families who lost their loved ones. But was it possible to bring to justice those who caused this tragedy? No. They are hiding in Russia. And, obviously, received security guarantees from the Russian state. Has Russia paid compensation to the relatives of the victims? No. It still denies its guilt in the tragedy. Eight years have already passed and justice has not been restored yet. And no one knows how much longer it will take for at least one tragedy to receive a worthy response from the international community, from all of us. And how many more new tragedies has Russia created or will create? It is often said that unpunished evil returns. I would add: unpunished evil returns winged, with a sense of omnipotence. If the world had punished Russia for what it did in 2014, there would be none of the horrors of this invasion of Ukraine in 2022. We need to fix these terrible mistakes now. I am grateful to Australia for its bipartisan support for our defense against invaders. For the help that your state has already given us. In particular, for 70 thousand tons of coal for the needs of our energy. But this is just the beginning. Together we can, and therefore must do more. New sanctions against Russia are needed. Strong sanctions. As long as it doesn't abandon nuclear blackmail, the blockade of the sea, it must pay the highest price. No Russian ship should be allowed into the ports of the free world. Buying Russian oil means paying for the destruction of the foundations of global security. Any business activity with Russia must be completely stopped. Not a single dollar for the elimination of people! Any attempt by Russia to circumvent sanctions must also be stopped. After all, what kind of sanctions are these, if they can be circumvented thanks to simple schemes? But above all, we must arm those who are really fighting for freedom. For evil to lose and for Russia to seek peace, Ukraine must have everything it needs on the battlefield. For example, you have wonderful Bushmaster armored vehicles that can significantly help Ukraine. As well as other models of equipment and weapons that can strengthen our position. If you have the opportunity - Ukraine will be grateful to you. Now in Ukraine they will definitely do more for our common freedom, for our common security than being covered with dust on your land. The Ukrainian people have already shown the world how sincerely we value freedom. How consistently we are ready to defend it. Our heroes are fighting against the army that is considered one of the strongest in the world. But all our people, without exception, are already thinking about the future. About how we will live after the war. How we will rebuild our country, our Black Sea region. We invite the world's leading countries, leading companies and the best specialists to join the project of Ukraine's reconstruction. Take patronage of a region, city or industry of your choice in our country that needs restoration. Your state has given Ukraine a special status of a like-minded country. But we are not only related in our thoughts - we are also related in our dreams. Therefore, I invite your beautiful country to look closely at our southern regions, at our coasts of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Restoration of our ports, development of such cities as, for example, Kherson, which is fighting for its freedom today, restoration of the maritime industry of Ukraine can be a special contribution to stability for you after this terrible war. Together with the fundamental protection of free navigation, this will restore the strength of the old but correct words: whoever is able to defend freedom at sea, is able to defend freedom in the world. I believe you can do it! And I hope that the Ukrainian community of Australia, our strong Ukrainian community, will join this common work. It will support us now as much as in previous years. Dear friends, the geographical distance between us is insane. Thousands of kilometers. But what does this distance mean for those who have a common understanding, who see the world the same way, who are bitterly disturbed when the enemy comes, when children are killed, when cities are destroyed, when refugees are shot on the roads, when a peaceful country is turned into a burned territory? Then any distance disappears. Geography means nothing. Only humanity matters. Only a dream of returning to a peaceful life. A dream we will fulfill. Definitely. And definitely together. Thank you! Thank you Australia! Glory to Ukraine!"
"The Red Cross announced Russia's approval of access for the humanitarian convoy to Mariupol, also corridors from Melitopol and Enerhodar were agreed - Iryna Vereshchuk",2022-03-31T11:01:00Z,"Ukraine has received a message from the International Committee of the Red Cross that the Russian Federation confirms its readiness to open access for the humanitarian convoy to Mariupol in transit through Berdyansk. In addition, two humanitarian corridors in the Zaporizhzhia region have been agreed - from Melitopol and Enerhodar. This was announced by Deputy Prime Minister - Minister for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories Iryna Vereshchuk. According to her, 45 buses were sent to Mariupol along the route. In particular, as of 9:00 am, 28 buses were to be allowed to pass through the Russian checkpoint in Vasylivka. In addition, 17 buses have already departed from Zaporizhzhia. ""We will do everything possible to ensure that buses arrive in Mariupol today and pick up people who have not yet been able to get out of the city,"" said the Deputy Prime Minister. Two humanitarian corridors in the Zaporizhzhia region have been agreed. In particular, for the delivery of humanitarian aid and the evacuation of people from the city of Melitopol. It is also planned to organize a column of citizens on their own transport from the city of Enerhodar to Zaporizhzhia. Iryna Vereshchuk added that people on their own transport will be able to join the humanitarian columns from Mariupol and Melitopol on the way to Zaporizhzhia. ""Our military has fully confirmed and guarantees a full ceasefire. So, at 9:00 we will start the evacuation,"" said the Deputy Prime Minister."
"It is very important to develop new packages of sanctions against Russia, as it is a powerful and effective mechanism for influencing the governing regime - Andriy Yermak",2022-03-31T10:41:00Z,"Sanctions are a powerful and effective mechanism for influencing Russia and those who support the ruling regime in the aggressor country. However, sanctions need to be deepened, so a new US package is expected to be announced soon. This was stated by Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak in an interview to TV presenter Vadym Karpyak, which was broadcast within the information marathon ""United News #UArazom"". ""It is very important to develop new packages of sanctions,"" Andriy Yermak stressed. He said that during the recent conversation between President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US President Joseph Biden, our state received a signal that a new package of sanctions from the United States will be introduced in the coming days. ""We see that US sanctions are very effective today. This is a very powerful tool. It needs to be continued,"" said the Head of the President's Office. According to him, sanctions will primarily affect Russian politicians, deputies and people who supported the war against Ukraine and on whom this regime is based. ""Certainly, it will be financial sanctions, economic ones,"" Andriy Yermak said. The Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine stressed that sanctions should also be imposed on Russian energy sources and the largest banks. ""These sanctions should include an embargo on energy, first of all I'm talking about an embargo on oil exports. If it takes a long time or there are some difficulties, we also said that sanctions should be introduced making it impossible for Russia to receive funds for the sale of oil, and this money could be used in some way in Ukraine's interests,"" Andriy Yermak said. He clarified that the issue of imposing an energy embargo concerns both gas and oil. The Head of the Office of the President added that Ukraine is making every effort to ensure that European countries also support the embargo on Russian energy. ""Of course, it is a very complicated issue. We know that some EU countries are ready and they understand that today it is impossible to think of any benefit when children are killed. And it is impossible now to measure money, some income, when it concerns human life,"" he said. At the same time, Andriy Yermak stated that there are countries that still have a different position. But the talks of the President of Ukraine with the leaders of these states, his addresses to the parliaments and nations, the work of Ukrainian diplomats are aimed at changing the attitude in these countries. After all, if the governments of some states are hesitant, they must listen to the opinion of their citizens. ""The nations of the world have already made their choice today - they are all with Ukraine, they are all on the side of good. That is why it is very difficult now for the countries that still continue to ""play"" and do not have a clear position - today or tomorrow they will answer the questions of their people why they did nothing in eight years and what they did when Ukrainians were killed and when there was war,"" said the Head of the Office of the President. Andriy Yermak also noted that sanctions are a powerful tool, but they need a very deep and rapid analysis. That is why there is an initiative to organize the work of a group of Ukrainian and international experts who will analyze the real impact of the restrictions imposed on Russia. He said that experts will not only study the sanctions already in place - what works and what doesn't. They will also talk about it publicly. In addition, the Head of the Office of the President called important the direction of this group's work to develop mechanisms that would make it impossible to circumvent the restrictions - both for individuals and for countries."
"Ukraine needs more weapons, because we defend the values of a democratic world - Head of the President's Office",2022-03-31T10:14:00Z,"Ukraine needs as big a supply of weapons as possible because our country pays a very high price every day defending the values of a democratic world in the fight against the aggressor. This was stated by Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak in an interview to leading international journalist of the American television company CNN Christiane Amanpour. Andriy Yermak noted that Ukraine does not see any real confirmation of Russia's statements on the withdrawal of troops from certain areas of the frontline. ""We believe they have changed their strategy and plans. Unfortunately, this does not mean stopping the war. I can say that the situation remains pretty difficult. I especially want to dwell on the humanitarian situation - everything is very bad,"" he said. The Head of the President's Office stressed that Mariupol is in a catastrophic situation, where people are dying without food and water, and the Russians do not allow them to leave the city. ""The Russians did not allow the residents to leave the city. Russian troops have taken thousands of residents to Russia,"" said Andriy Yermak. According to him, the catastrophe in Mariupol is very similar to the blockade of Leningrad during World War II. ""Our Ukrainian position is very open and very transparent: we want to stop this war, we want Russian troops to be withdrawn from our territory. We insist on opening the humanitarian corridors, especially from Mariupol,"" said the Head of the President's Office. Andriy Yermak stressed that the Ukrainian delegation continues difficult talks with the Russians, and the meeting in Istanbul is a confirmation of such a dialogue. ""I can say that we have very principled positions, and we do not want to compromise on our independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty. We are ready to continue the discussion, our delegation works around the clock seven days a week in a video format. Yesterday (March 29 - ed.) it happened live. I have a little optimism about that. We are continuing this conversation,"" said the Head of the Office of the President. Andriy Yermak noted that in his addresses to the parliaments of the world, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasizes the need to increase weaponry supplies to Ukraine. ""We do not have enough weapons. And we need it to continue our struggle,"" he said. The Head of the Office of the President hopes that all partner states of Ukraine understand that today our country pays an exorbitant price for its freedom, so the issue of weaponry supply is very important. ""The whole world can see that Ukrainians are a nation that will never stop fighting because we are fighting for our land. We are fighting for our country. We are fighting for the whole democratic world,"" he said. Andriy Yermak also emphasized that Volodymyr Zelenskyy is a very brave man focused on results. ""He is the absolute leader of our nation. He is a man who gives the necessary energy and courage to all Ukrainians, the whole world, all people. Because I am absolutely convinced that the people of the world support Ukrainians, they made their choice. And we can see thousands of people on the streets in different cities around the world. And we will win, Ukraine will be the winner. We are sure of that. But it is necessary to do it as soon as possible,"" the Head of the President's Office stressed."
Give us more weapons - Andriy Yermak,2022-03-31T00:00:00Z,"Ukraine calls on Canada and other partners to supply weapons. This was announced by Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak during an online conversation with journalists of the Canadian Global News. ""We need more weapons. Small arms, demining systems, drones, counter-battery radars, howitzers, body armor... Everything! But first of all, we need to close the sky to protect our cities from missiles,"" Andriy Yermak explained. The situation in the capital of Ukraine, Kyiv, he noted, is as normal as possible in the current conditions. At the same time, there is no reason to talk about a full-fledged withdrawal of Russian troops from the Kyiv direction. ""Our people are calm, they are full of dignity and energy. Kyiv is reviving, shops are working, all services are working, public transport is working. Air alarms have already become a certain element of the current life of people in the city,"" said the Head of the Office of the President. He referred to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy who said in his address that the Ukrainian side has not yet seen the Russians withdraw all their forces from the Kyiv direction. There are some movements, but it is more like a change of position or regrouping. Andriy Yermak noted that according to one of the probable scenarios, the Russians will concentrate their forces around Donbas. He reminded that the blockade of Mariupol continues and the situation in this city is catastrophic. Ukraine continues negotiations with many foreign leaders to unblock Mariupol as soon as possible. Andriy Yermak stressed that the world community should continue to increase pressure on Russia. In particular, a group of Ukrainian and international experts has been set up at the President's Office, which has already begun analyzing the real impact of sanctions against Russia and developing proposals for new effective measures. The Head of the Office of the President also stressed the importance of increasing military assistance to Ukraine, in particular from Canada. ""Every hour of the war takes the lives of Ukrainians and causes great damage to our country,"" he concluded."
"We will not give up anything and will fight for every meter of our land, for every person - address by the President of Ukraine",2022-03-30T23:53:00Z,"Dear Ukrainians! Today I have few words, not much time, a lot of emotions and even more tasks. It is that kind of moment. A turning point, when we can and should talk only about the most important thing. Yes, there is an ongoing negotiation process. But these are still words. So far no specifics. There are also other words about the alleged withdrawal of Russian troops from Kyiv and Chernihiv. About the alleged reduction of activity of occupiers in these directions. We know that this is not a withdrawal, but the consequences of exile. Consequences of the work of our defenders. But we also see that at the same time there is an accumulation of Russian troops for new strikes in Donbas. And we are preparing for this. We do not believe anyone - we do not trust any beautiful verbal constructions. There is a real situation on the battlefield. And now - this is the most important thing. We will not give up anything. And we will fight for every meter of our land, for every our person. In the current situation of our state, there should be no such discussions to which society and our politicians are accustomed in peacetime. If someone pretends to be able to teach our Armed Forces how to fight, how to resist the enemy, the best way to do it is to go to the battlefield directly. Not from a chair at home or from the place where you left for safety. But from the area of real hostilities. If you are not ready for this, you should not even start teaching our defenders. Today was a very active diplomatic day for me. A difficult one. Priorities are known. There are three of them: weapons for Ukraine, new sanctions against Russia and financial support for our state. A conversation took place with US President Biden. Very detailed, lasted an hour. Of course, I thanked the United States for a new $ 1 billion humanitarian aid package and additional $ 500 million in direct budget support. And I stressed that right now is a turning point. I told President Biden what Ukraine needs. And I was as sincere as possible with him. The support of the United States is vital for us. And now it is especially important to lend a hand to Ukraine, to show all the power of the democratic world. And if we want to fight for freedom together, then we ask our partners ... And if we really fight for freedom and protection for democracies together, then we have the right to demand help in this crucial difficult moment. Tanks, planes, artillery systems... Freedom must be armed no worse than tyranny. I also spoke about this today in an address to the Norwegian parliament and people. To one of the states that supported us significantly. I called for more help to Ukraine. With weapons and sanctions against Russia as well. I spoke today with the President of Egypt and the Crown Prince of the United Arab Emirates. I have done, am doing and will do my best so that our people can defend themselves until justice is restored. On Ukrainian soil and in the Black Sea region. This is our fundamental interest. This is our survival. It is for the survival of the Ukrainian people that we are now fighting. In this war, without exaggeration, the Patriotic War against Russia. And now I want to mention a few more important things. First. There are those who work together with everyone to defend the state. So that Ukraine can gain its future. We appreciate the work of each such person. And there are those who waste time and work only to stay in office. Today I signed the first decree to recall such a person. Such an Ambassador of Ukraine. From Morocco. The Ambassador from Georgia was also recalled. With all due respect: if there are no weapons, no sanctions, no restrictions for Russian business - please look for another job. I look forward to concrete results in the coming days from our representatives in Latin America, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Africa. I expect the same results from military attaches in the coming days. The diplomatic frontline is one of the key frontlines. And everyone there must work as efficiently as possible to win and help the army. Each on the diplomatic frontline must work just as each of our defenders on the battlefield. And the second point. Traditionally, today, before delivering this address, at the request of the Commander-in-Chief, I signed a decree on state awards to our military. 122 defenders, 23 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"
Volodymyr Zelenskyy had an hour-long phone conversation with Joseph Biden,2022-03-30T20:37:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy had an hour-long phone conversation with US President Joseph Biden. Volodymyr Zelenskyy shared his assessment of the situation on the battlefield and the forecast of developments. He spoke about the crimes of the occupiers against the civilian population and the heroic efforts of Ukrainians aimed to protect the independence and territorial integrity of their country. The Presidents discussed concrete support that will further strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities at sea, on land and in the air. ""We need peace, and it will be achieved only when we have a strong position on the battlefield. Our morale is firm, there is enough determination, but we need your immediate support,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The leaders discussed preparations for the next package of painful sanctions against Russia, as well as the negotiation process and security guarantees for Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the United States for another $ 1 billion humanitarian aid package and additional $ 500 million in direct budget support."
Mykhailo Podolyak: International multilateral treaty on security guarantees will give Ukraine reliable protection against possible new aggression,2022-03-30T18:50:00Z,"Ukraine wants to sign an international treaty on security guarantees, which will give it reliable allies and real protection from any new aggression in the future. Adviser to the Head of the President's Office and member of the Ukrainian negotiating team Mykhailo Podolyak emphasized this during an online briefing at the Ukrainian Media Center. Mykhailo Podolyak noted that he had quite optimistic impressions of the face-to-face round of the Ukrainian-Russian talks on ending the war, which took place on March 29 in Istanbul (Turkey). ""We have reached a very important construction for Ukraine when it will no longer be a fantasy, but a specific treaty on security guarantees, which will be legally fixed. Guarantor countries that undertake international legal obligations will be fixed there,"" he said. The Adviser to the Head of the President's Office noted that Ukraine has been fighting one-on-one with the powerful army of the Russian Federation for more than a month. That is why our state wants to have such allies who will stand by when help is needed here and now. According to him, in case of signing an international multilateral treaty on security guarantees, our state will finally have not only its own army, which is fighting very hard today, but also an additional security contour due to powerful allies that will stand by Ukraine. Mykhailo Podolyak said that a group of international lawyers moderated by Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak is consulting with Ukraine's future security guarantors. ""He holds preliminary negotiations with the guarantor countries at the level of political advisers, explains our positions, explains the fundamental principles of the treaty on security guarantees. After that, consultations take place at the level of legal groups,"" he said. Mykhailo Podolyak reminded that Ukraine would like to see the permanent members of the UN Security Council as the main guarantors of its security, as well as Turkey, Germany, Poland and several other countries. In particular, Italy has already expressed interest in participating in such a treaty. The treaty will be open for any country to accede to. According to the Adviser to the Head of the President's Office, many countries during and after this war will realize that the old formats of European or even global security do not work, and will understand that the future will be based on such agreements as Ukraine has proposed. Mykhailo Podolyak is convinced that the available developments indicate that preparations for the meeting of the Presidents of Ukraine and Russia can already begin. However, the Russian side has yet to consider Ukraine's proposals and give a preliminary answer to them. Currently, online working groups are constantly working to ensure the continuity of the negotiation process. According to the Adviser to the Head of the President's Office, intermediate proposals were recorded at the meeting in Istanbul, which the parties have already worked out and discussed. There is a possibility that in a few days it will be possible to agree on the next round of talks. At the same time, he stressed that all issues related to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine are inviolable for Ukrainian negotiators, which is constantly emphasized by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy."
Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Norwegian Storting,2022-03-30T17:22:00Z,"Mr. President of the Storting! Mr. Prime Minister! Members of the Government, dear deputies! Norwegian people! It is a great honor for me to address you on behalf of the Ukrainian people. Today is the 35th day of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. After 8 years of war in the east of our state, in Donbas, Russian troops went on the offensive from three directions at once - from the north, east and south. They attacked us on land, in the air and from the sea. Russian missiles and air bombs hit our cities and civilian infrastructure every day and night. There are no forbidden targets for Russian troops. They attack everything. They attack hospitals and airports, food warehouses and residential areas. Ukraine's losses are enormous. Tens of thousands of houses were destroyed, dozens of cities and villages were burned, millions of people were left without the opportunity to live normally. The columns of Russian armored vehicles are not decreasing. Although we have already destroyed more Russian tanks and other combat vehicles than Moscow has lost in any war in the last 50 years. Russia's treacherous actions at sea deserve special attention, as it is one of the greatest threats to international security of all that has emerged since World War II. Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov have been blocked by Russia since the first day of their invasion. About a hundred ships cannot enter the Mediterranean Sea. Some ships were simply hijacked - this is piracy for theft of cargo. Several ships were fired at. But the blockade of ports was implemented by Russia not just by the navy. They mined the sea. And now the mines planted by Russian forces are drifting at sea. And this is a danger for anyone: for any ships and ports of any country in the Black Sea region. One of these mines was recently cleared in time in the Bosphorus. Another - near the Bulgarian border. Another - near the coast of Romania. I don't even want to imagine what will happen if some of these mines are not cleared in time. Who will be affected then? Maybe ferries, God forbid. Or passenger liners. Or merchant ships. Or possibly tankers, the explosion of which could lead not only to human casualties, but also to a large-scale environmental disaster. And then Russia will say again, as always, that it is not them. As it has said many times when killing critics of the Russian government in Europe or even shooting down the Malaysian Boeing in the sky over Donbas. The war is not limited to our borders now. No other state since World War II and the Nazi aggression at sea has posed such a threat to free navigation as Russia has already posed. Think about it - how do they look at it in those regions of the world where there are potential aggressors and new wars with neighbors are quite possible? They are waiting there to see if Russia will be punished enough for its actions. These horrible, aggressive actions. If not, you will see: everything we are experiencing now will be repeated in other regions. Ladies and Gentlemen! Norwegian people! We have no common borders with you, but we have a common neighbor who denies all our common values. For the Russian state in its current condition neither the freedom of nations nor the freedom of human matters. In Russia, universally recognized human rights are denied. It's not that there is no security for minorities, they can just be killed there. And they are being killed. I'm sure you know all about it. You know that there is no rule of law and fair trial. You know that splitting and destroying European democracies is a long-standing policy of the Russian Federation. Russia's war against Ukraine simply continues all this. It is an attempt to destroy everything that Europe is holding on to, what we are holding on to. Therefore, it is an aggression that aims to go beyond our borders. I think you are experiencing new risks near your border with Russia. A number of Russian troops that has no normal explanation has already been amassed in the Arctic region. For what? Against whom? The future of Europe - the whole continent from north to south, from west to east - is being decided right now. On our land, on Ukrainian soil, in Ukrainian air, in Ukrainian sea. So that your soldiers do not have to defend NATO's eastern flank, so that Russian mines do not drift to your ports and fjords, so that your people do not have to get used to the sound of air alarms and so that Russian tanks are not amassed at your border, we must stop the aggression of the Russian Federation together and only together. I am grateful to your Government and to the whole of your society for the tangible support you have already given to our state. Including for the help with weapons. You have taken historic steps by giving us what we need in the struggle for freedom and against tyranny. But the war continues. Russia is sending new forces to our land to continue to destroy us, to destroy Ukrainians. We must do more to stop the war! The first and most important thing is weapons. Freedom must be armed no worse than tyranny. I will be very specific in these walls, in your walls. Believe me, we are losing specific people, specific cities are being destroyed. So I want to make it clear what we need. In particular, anti-ship weapons - Harpoon missiles, as well as air-defense systems - NASAMS. In addition, we need weapons to destroy armored vehicles and artillery systems. All the weapons you can help us with will be used only to protect our freedom, your freedom. Only to protect the freedom and security you enjoy with other Europeans. The second thing is sanctions. The only way that can motivate Russia to seek peace. I am convinced that the country that annually awards the Nobel Peace Prize understands better than anyone else what peace is worth and how we need it. How valuable every effort on the way to peace is. Therefore, new sanctions packages must be introduced weekly, without pauses. The stronger they are, the sooner we will restore peace. I am grateful to Norway for joining the EU sanctions. But I ask you to do something else as well. It is important that European companies do not help this military machine, which has already killed thousands of our people, destroyed dozens of cities completely. No krone, I beg you, no euro of taxes that help Russian aggression! For example, your company MOTUS TECH and other companies must stop supporting Russia's ability to destroy neighbors. How can one supply ship equipment to Russia when it uses its fleet to mine the sea and destroy any opportunities for free navigation? Also, the European Union, and therefore, I hope, Norway, must finally implement a ban on Russian ships using ports on the continent. As long as Russia blocks our ports, it has no right to use all the ports of the free world. I want to emphasize: this is not a question of money, no! This is a question of freedom and security of navigation in the world. Third, you are one of the most responsible suppliers of energy resources in the world. Confidence of the whole world in Norway has always been and I am sure will be at the highest level. This contrasts sharply with Russia's behavior in energy supplies. It is you who can make a decisive contribution to Europe's energy security by providing the necessary resources for both the European Union and Ukraine. We have already started a dialogue on the supply of about 5 billion cubic meters of gas to Ukraine for the next heating season. I hope this will be the basis for our long-term cooperation in this area. Ladies and Gentlemen! Norwegian people! Looking at our common path, we always meet in history in difficult yet defining moments for Europe. Like a thousand years ago, when the Norwegian Vikings were frequent visitors in Kyiv and participated in the formation of the first Kyiv state. Or - Garðaríki. This is what the lands of Rus'-Ukraine were called in Scandinavian sagas. The country of fortresses. The country of cities. Both our and your ancestors lived in them more than a thousand years ago. Today, Russian bombs are flying at our land and our people. At the land where the Ukrainian Princess Elisiv of Kyiv was born and grew up. Wife of King Harald III of Norway, mother of King Olaf the Peaceful, grandmother of Magnus III, great-grandmother of Eystein I and Sigurd the Crusader. These are the pages of our common history! History of Kyivan Rus’. And this history was created on this land and by our people. And we are defending it together again. This was the case 77 years ago, when Ukrainians, along with other peoples of the anti-Hitler coalition, liberated European land from Nazi invaders. Fedir Kompaniyets, a Ukrainian from the Sumy region, was the first soldier to enter the liberated Kirkenes in October 1944 at the head of his unit. Now in his small homeland - in the Sumy region - fierce battles with Russian invaders are taking place. Ukrainians united as much as possible to repel this aggression. To protect our state and our way of life - democratic, free, with full protection of rights and freedoms for everyone. The price is horrible for us - today we know about the death of 145 children, and this is only an officially confirmed number. It is not possible to establish the full number of dead in the occupied areas. It is likely that we have lost hundreds - think about it! - hundreds of children. Just children. After this war we will have not only to rebuild the country physically - rebuild our cities, demine our land, our sea. We will have to rehabilitate people, both military and civilian. Heal after injuries, after everything they had to go through. I know that your country has a lot of experience in rehabilitation. And this is something you can also help us with. And now I invite you to join our project of reconstruction of Ukraine. The colossal losses we have suffered mean that the amount of recovery, the amount of investment required will also be colossal. As one of the world's most responsible investors, Norway can do much to restore stability in Eastern Europe. And then, I am sure, we in Ukraine will be able to adopt one of your extraordinary traditions. A wonderful tradition. The one that characterizes you the most - peaceful people, a society built on the principles of good. Every year on May 17, on Constitution Day, you organize an extremely sincere celebration - a parade of schoolchildren. Children from all over Norway take part in it. This year, our children will go with your children - Ukrainians who came to you for protection and security. And I hope that soon, when we manage to restore peace in Ukraine together, and it will happen, I will be able to invite you, to invite you and your children to take part in such a parade in Kyiv on one of our holidays. To celebrate our common freedom, our common right to a happy future for our children. In peace. In Ukraine. In Europe. Because, as they say, if a rock breaks off from Europe, Europe becomes smaller. So, we must do everything to ensure that a rock like Ukraine is always with Europe. Only together. Thank you Norway! Glory to Ukraine!"
The Office of the President of Ukraine supported the initiative to establish the Ukrainian Global University,2022-03-30T15:25:00Z,"With the support of the Office of the President of Ukraine, the government, educational institutions and non-governmental organizations are creating the Ukrainian Global University (UGU), a network that brings together the world's best educational institutions to provide Ukrainian students, scholarship holders, researchers and lecturers with access to educational institutions around the world, as well as new scholarships and postdoctoral programs. Participants of the UGU initiative will have not only support, but also access to quality education and the opportunity to conduct research abroad, and then will be able to apply the acquired knowledge and skills in their home country. In the future, the UGU team plans to launch internships and programs in Ukraine that will allow their participants to quickly reintegrate and contribute to the reconstruction of the country upon their return. The initiative stipulates that displaced students, researchers and scholarship holders will not be abandoned. The main goal of UGU is to overcome the devastating consequences of Russian aggression in Ukraine and to attract leading world experience to build a new Ukraine as a worthy member of the world community of free and democratic nations. ""Ukraine's integration into the world educational space has been and remains one of the key priorities of our state. Now Ukrainian schoolchildren, students, teachers, scientists who have suffered devastating losses as a result of the military aggression of the Russian Federation, need support! Investing in educational potential, we, together with leading universities in the world and Ukraine, are investing in the future. The establishment of the Ukrainian Global University is a call to the entire educational world community to support Ukrainian schoolchildren, students and scientists in obtaining quality education. These people will return to Ukraine to rebuild it after the war with world-class knowledge,"" said Olha Budnyk, adviser - commissioner of the President of Ukraine for the Fund of the President of Ukraine for Support of Education, Science and Sports. Currently, the UGU team is focused on establishing personal and institutional partnerships with schools, universities and research centers around the world, which will be ready to consider applications for medium- and long-term programs from Ukrainians and sponsor a number of students, scientists and researchers. Details and conditions are agreed with each partner institution separately, but all partners must sign an open memorandum with UGU, which defines common values and principles. Partnership applications can be submitted at https://uglobal.university/   Stanford, Harvard and dozens of other leading universities in the world have already supported the initiative. ""Stanford realized the importance of creating new educational programs for Ukrainians six years ago when we launched the Ukrainian Emerging Leaders Program. Graduates of this program have already made significant changes to improve Ukraine. I support UGU and call on all other universities in the world to support Ukrainian students and scholars,"" said Michael McFaul, a professor of political science at Stanford University and director of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. ""The University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne has a long tradition of solidarity with scholars and students in exile. It is especially important for us that UGU was founded by Ukrainian scientists who are now fighting not only for the sovereignty of their country, but also for our common European values. We will continue to provide our support after the end of the war, when Ukrainians return to rebuild their country,"" said Christine Neau-Leduc, President of the University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne. To maximize efforts, the initiative team forms a network of volunteers, which can be joined by graduates and representatives of educational institutions from around the world. They will help attract more institutions to the network, UGU is convinced, as they will be its ambassadors in their schools, colleges and universities. Volunteers can also contact the administrations of any institution around the world to initiate the process of establishing their partnership with UGU. If Ukrainian students or scholars want to become members of UGU, they can use the simplified application process on the website. They will then have to go through the full or simplified application process at any educational institution listed on the platform to increase their chances of admission. A prerequisite for participation in the program for all students is return home after graduation or research completion to help rebuild Ukraine after the war. UGU is also working with DuoLingo, an online language learning program, to allow Ukrainians to take English language tests for free and receive certificates wherever they are. Leading domestic educational institutions and organizations, including the Kyiv School of Economics, Ukraine Global Scholars, the Ukrainian Catholic University, the Emerging Leaders Program at Stanford University, the Professional Government Association, the SET University and the Kyiv Academic University, joined the establishment of the Ukrainian Global University (UGU). The initiative was also approved by the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine and the Embassy of Ukraine in the United States."
Iryna Vereshchuk announced the approval of three humanitarian corridors in the Zaporizhzhia region and called on the UN Security Council to take measures to demilitarize the Chornobyl zone due to the danger of detonation of Russian ammunition,2022-03-30T10:41:00Z,"In Ukraine, as of March 30, three humanitarian corridors have been agreed in the Zaporizhzhia region for the evacuation of Mariupol residents to Berdyansk and for the evacuation of residents of Melitopol and Enerhodar. This was announced by Deputy Prime Minister - Minister for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories Iryna Vereshchuk. ""Three humanitarian corridors have been agreed: for evacuation of Mariupol residents and delivery of humanitarian aid to Berdyansk, delivery of humanitarian aid and evacuation of people from Melitopol, as well as for a convoy of people on their own transport from Enerhodar to Zaporizhzhia,"" she said. According to Iryna Vereshchuk, the formed convoys of buses and trucks with humanitarian aid have already left the city of Zaporizhzhia. The Deputy Prime Minister stressed that the Ukrainian side demands that the occupying forces abide by their commitments and allow humanitarian columns through checkpoints. She noted that on the way back to the city of Zaporizhzhia, citizens from Berdyansk and Melitopol will be able to join the humanitarian columns using their own vehicles. ""Yesterday, during the talks, the Russian delegation received proposals to organize humanitarian corridors to the 97 most affected settlements in the Kharkiv, Kyiv, Kherson, Chernihiv, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, Luhansk and Mykolaiv regions. Today we will continue to work to get answers to these proposals,"" said the Deputy Prime Minister. She reminded that on March 29 a detonation of ammunition took place at the warehouse of the Russian Armed Forces in Belgorod, Russia. According to Iryna Vereshchuk, this is an example of the typical Russian neglect of safety and mass use of dangerous ammunition produced during World War II. ""Only yesterday, the Ukrainian General Staff warned of the threat of self-detonation of ammunition, a huge number of which Russia has piled up near the Chornobyl nuclear power plant. Russia must immediately withdraw its troops from the Chornobyl zone,"" said the Deputy Prime Minister. According to her, in the context of nuclear security, the irresponsible and unprofessional actions of the Russian military pose a very serious threat not only to Ukraine, but also to hundreds of millions of Europeans. ""Therefore, we demand that the UN Security Council take immediate measures to demilitarize the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone and establish a special UN mission there to eliminate the risk of a repeat of the Chornobyl nuclear disaster as a result of actions of the Russian occupation forces,"" Iryna Vereshchuk said."
President: In “Diia” citizens can already apply for compensation for housing lost as a result of hostilities,2022-03-30T09:05:00Z,"As of today, one can apply for compensation for the loss of housing due to the Russian invasion in the application of public services ""Diia"". This was announced by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his address. “As I promised, the state will compensate for the loss of a house or apartment as a result of hostilities. Every citizen of ours can already submit an application in ""Diia"". Applications are already available in the mobile application. You need to update the app to see this new service,” the President noted.  In a week it will be available to submit an application offline - in the centers of administrative services. All the necessary details will soon be clarified by the government. “The main thing is that the state will compensate for every meter of lost real estate,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. In addition, according to the President, the government has expanded the program of assistance to those institutions that support displaced persons from the areas of hostilities."
Andriy Yermak met with a group of experts who will analyze the impact of sanctions against Russia,2022-03-29T23:38:00Z,"Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak held an inaugural online meeting with a group of Ukrainian and international experts who will analyze the real impact of sanctions against Russia. ""Today, sanctions are issued by our partners almost every week. They are different. Some of them have already started working and are very sensitive to Russia. And some seem to sound like sanctions, but they don't work at all. As for some Russians, they have already found ways to bypass them. The sanctions mechanism itself is very powerful, and our goal is for the sanctions to work effectively,"" he said at the beginning of the meeting. Andriy Yermak believes that it is necessary to reach the pace of the weekly increase of sanctions pressure against Russia. According to him, Ukraine's partners are currently working on the introduction of a new sanctions package against Russia. Critical import chains will be targeted, including export controls and sanctions aimed at suppliers cooperating with the Russian military-industrial complex. The Head of the President's Office also noted that there can be no question of lifting, stopping or changing the sanctions against the aggressor, until the war is stopped, troops are withdrawn from Ukraine, our state receives reparations and compensation for the damage to the Ukrainian state and its citizens. Former US Ambassador to Russia and former US National Security Adviser Michael McFaul said it was necessary to review what had been done and ensure that new sanctions were imposed on Russia every week to increase pressure on Russia. Daniel Fried, former State Department's Coordinator for Sanctions Policy, said there was a need to halt Russian oil and gas exports as much as possible and reduce relevant profits. He is also convinced that the dynamics and speed of decision-making are important in the issue of sanctions pressure. For his part, Deputy Head of the Office of the President Rostyslav Shurma noted that the issue of oil exports is the most important and sensitive when it comes to effective pressure on Russia, and it is on it that we should focus the most. He also stressed the need to recognize Russia as a state sponsoring terrorism. ""This will automatically lead to bans on many corporations. Not only those related to oil and gas,"" said Rostyslav Shurma. He also considers sanctions against the entire Russian political elite or people involved in politics important. In addition, in his opinion, a halt in the supply of certain chemicals, spare parts and important components for the mechanical engineering, defense and oil refining industries will be critical for Russia."
The new multilateral treaty should make any aggression against Ukraine impossible - Andriy Yermak,2022-03-29T23:24:00Z,"The new multilateral treaty should make any aggression against Ukraine impossible and become a key element of the new international security system. This was stated by Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak commenting on the face-to-face round of Ukrainian-Russian talks, which took place on March 29 in Istanbul. ""We all and I personally liaise around the clock with our international partners to elaborate a quality and effective multilateral security treaty,"" he said. According to the Head of the Office of the President, today the relevant work is underway together with the United States, Great Britain, China, Canada, France, Germany, Turkey, Italy, Poland and Israel. The leaders of these states have appointed specific political and security advisers. They are working with the Ukrainian party on a future document on security guarantees. ""Ukraine needs clearly and qualitatively formulated legally effective and binding international security guarantees. The horrors that the Russians have brought to the Ukrainian people must never be repeated,"" Andriy Yermak said. He stressed that ""Ukraine is primarily concerned about ending the war, withdrawal of Russian troops from our territory and, of course, building a new security structure."" The Head of the President's Office noted that today it is important for Russia to stop the shelling immediately and for the full-fledged humanitarian corridors to all cities where a humanitarian catastrophe already exists or is approaching to be opened as soon as possible. First of all, we are talking about Mariupol, other cities of Donbas and Chernihiv. Andriy Yermak thanked the members of the Ukrainian delegation for their important and difficult work. ""I'm sure everyone understands how difficult it is to negotiate with representatives of Russia today,"" said the Head of the President's Office."
"Signals from the negotiations can be called positive, but they do not silence the explosion of Russian shells - address by the President of Ukraine",2022-03-29T22:53:00Z,"Wise people of a strong country! The 34th day of the full-scale invasion of Russia and our full-scale defense is coming to an end. Successful defense. I'm sure you saw the news today that the Russian military command allegedly decided to ""reduce hostilities in the directions of Kyiv and Chernihiv."" Well, the same can be said about Chornobaivka - as if the Russian aviation simply decided to fly less, and the Russian military vehicles - to drive less. I am grateful to all our defenders, to all those who ensure the defense of Kyiv. It is their brave and effective actions that force the enemy to retreat in this direction. However, we should not lose vigilance. The situation has not become easier. The scale of the challenges has not diminished. The Russian army still has significant potential to continue attacks against our state. They still have a lot of equipment and enough people completely deprived of rights whom they can send to the cauldron of war. Therefore, we stay alert and do not reduce our defense efforts. Both in the north of our state and in all other regions of Ukraine, where Russian troops have temporarily entered. The defense of Ukraine is the number one task now, and everything else is derived from it. It is on this basis that I consider the messages on the negotiation process, which is underway at various levels with representatives of the Russian Federation. The enemy is still in our territory. The shelling of our cities continues. Mariupol is blocked. Missile and air strikes do not stop. This is the reality. These are the facts. That is why the Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence and all those who have joined the defense of the state are the only guarantee of our survival today. As a nation. As a state. The guarantee that works. Yes, we can call positive the signals we hear from the negotiating platform. But these signals do not silence the explosion of Russian shells. Of course, we see all the risks. Of course, we see no reason to trust the words of certain representatives of a state that continues to fight for our destruction. Ukrainians are not naive people. Ukrainians have already learned during these 34 days of invasion and over the past eight years of the war in Donbas that only a concrete result can be trusted. The facts - if they change on our land. Of course, Ukraine is willing to negotiate and will continue the negotiation process. To the extent that really depends on us. We expect to get the result. There must be real security for us, for our state, for sovereignty, for our people. Russian troops must leave the occupied territories. Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity must be guaranteed. There can be no compromise on sovereignty and our territorial integrity. And there will not be any. These are clear principles. This is a clear vision of the possible outcome. And to those on social networks who perceive words as if they are facts already, I want to remind one thing: we live in a democratic state and fight for our freedom. For freedom for our people. Therefore, any decisions that are important for all our people must be made not by one person or a group of people with any political views, but by all our people. The wise people of Ukraine. And certain countries should not even expect that certain negotiations will facilitate the lifting of sanctions against the Russian Federation. The question of sanctions cannot even be raised until the war is over, until we get back what's ours and until we restore justice. On the contrary, sanctions must be strengthened. Intensified weekly. And they must be effective. Not just for headlines in the media that sanctions have been imposed, but for real peace. Real. And to ensure this, a team of Ukrainian and international experts has already begun work to assess the effectiveness of the sanctions imposed on Russia. On the Ukrainian side, this area is coordinated by Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak, and on the international side by Michael McFaul. During the day the rescue operation was ongoing in Mykolaiv. The debris of the building of the regional administration destroyed by Russian missile strikes was dismantled. As of now, 8 people have been reported killed and 30 wounded. It is likely that these are not final figures. The Russian troops hit Mykolaiv very insidiously. At a time when people came to their workplaces in the morning. Thank God, most of those in the building managed to evacuate when they heard an air alarm. This one more act of the Russian so-called denazification of Mykolaiv took place in the morning after the anniversary of liberation of the city from Nazi invaders. Mykolaiv residents remember the day of March 28, 1944. And they see who the Russian troops trying to capture their city now look like. I spoke about Mykolaiv today in my address to the Danish Parliament and the Danish people. I invited the society of this country to take part in the reconstruction of the city and the region after the war. In the framework of our program of Ukraine's reconstruction, we involve partner states, leading companies and the best specialists in order to guarantee the speed and quality of the reconstruction of our state. As I was told, this proposal was very positively received in Denmark. There is also important news from our government officials. As of today, the new functionality of our ""Diia"" state service will be available. As I promised, the state will compensate for the loss of a house or apartment as a result of hostilities. Every citizen of ours can already submit an application in ""Diia"". Applications are already available in the mobile application. You need to update the app to see this new service. And in a week it will be available offline - in the centers of administrative services. In itself, the functionality in ""Diia"" is quite convenient. But all the necessary details will still be clarified by our government. The main thing is that the state will compensate for every meter of lost real estate. In addition, government officials today expanded the program to help those institutions that support IDPs from the areas of hostilities. Another important decision was to allocate 426 million hryvnias to pay the miners' salaries. Traditionally, I signed several important decrees before delivering this evening address. The first is about awarding communications service employees. I am sincerely grateful to everyone who provides the fundamental basis of our lives. Who gives us connection. By the way, on the day of the beginning of the Russian invasion, the first missile strike in the JFO area was made against them. 12 people were awarded state awards, 4 - posthumously. The second signed decree is on awarding 126 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 34 of them - posthumously. We will always be grateful to each of our defenders for the defense of our state in the Ukrainian Patriotic War against Russia. May the memory of everyone who gave life for Ukraine live forever! Glory to each of our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"
"During the negotiations with Russia, the Ukrainian delegation officially outlined its proposals for a new system of security guarantees for our country",2022-03-29T17:20:00Z,"During the talks with Russia in Turkey, the Ukrainian party officially outlined its proposals for a new system of security guarantees for Ukraine. This was announced by Head of the Ukrainian delegation, Head of the Servant of the People faction David Arakhamia. ""Today we came up with an official proposal for a new system of security guarantees for Ukraine. We insist that this must be an international treaty signed by all countries - guarantors of security, which will be ratified, so as not to repeat the mistake that was once in the Budapest Memorandum. We want it to be a working international mechanism of concrete security guarantees for Ukraine,"" he said. David Arakhamia noted that the representatives of the Ukrainian delegation did not sign any documents - they only voiced Ukraine's proposals. According to him, the future treaty must contain a provision according to which within three days after the start of the war, aggression, military operation, any disguised, hybrid war against Ukraine, the guarantor countries hold consultations, after which they are legally obliged to provide military assistance to our country, in particular in the form of armaments and the closure of the skies. It is suggested that the guarantors will be permanent members of the UN Security Council: the United States, Great Britain, France, China and the Russian Federation, but ""this should be discussed separately."" Ukraine also wants to see Turkey, Germany, Canada, Italy, Poland and Israel among the guarantors. In addition, it is offered to provide for the free accession of other guarantors to the treaty. According to David Arakhamia, this mechanism is even clearer than in Article 5 of the 1949 North Atlantic Treaty founding NATO, which envisages no limits as regards the timing of consultations. As for the temporarily occupied territories of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, since their status is not regulated, international security guarantees will not work temporarily in these territories. Ukraine also offers to envisage in the future treaty that all guarantor countries not only do not object to the accession of the Ukrainian state to the European Union, but also should assist in this process. Member of the Ukrainian delegation Oleksandr Chalyi who heads the legal group of negotiators added that the key requirement of the Ukrainian party to the future treaty is clear, legally binding security guarantees for Ukraine, which should be analogous in content and form to Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. ""If we manage to consolidate these key provisions, which are a fundamental requirement for the Ukrainian party, Ukraine will be in a position to actually fix the current status of a non-aligned and non-nuclear state of permanent neutrality. Which has already historically been enshrined in our Declaration of State Sovereignty adopted on July 16, 1990,"" he said. Accordingly, Ukraine will undertake not to deploy foreign military bases, foreign military contingents on its territory, not to join military-political alliances, and military exercises on the territory of Ukraine will be possible with the consent of the guarantor countries. ""But it is fundamentally important that nothing in the future treaty will deny Ukraine's right to join the European Union. And, secondly, the guarantor countries are committed to facilitating this process,"" said Oleksandr Chalyi. He stressed that negotiations with Russia would continue in the next two weeks. At the same time, Ukraine has already begun consultations with all guarantor countries, and it will soon be possible to invite these countries to participate in multilateral negotiations. ""Until then, the most fundamental differences must be settled at the highest political level. Then a multilateral conference will be prepared, in which senior officials of the guarantor countries will take part, and this multilateral treaty will be signed,"" Oleksandr Chalyi said. For his part, Mykhailo Podolyak, Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, stressed that all the proposals of the Ukrainian delegation will be coordinated with Ukrainian society. According to him, the implementation of decisions on security guarantees will take place through an all-Ukrainian referendum, and after that - the ratification of this document by the Ukrainian parliament and the parliaments of the guarantor countries. ""That's the key thing. We need to get the support of society for this agreement to be consolidating for us,"" he said. Mykhailo Podolyak stressed that the position of Ukraine and Russia on the status of Crimea was offered to be fixed as a separate item. ""To hold bilateral negotiations on the status of Crimea and Sevastopol separately within 15 years. In a separate paragraph, we offer to the Russian party that Ukraine and Russia will not use military or armed forces to resolve the Crimean issue during this period, while negotiations are underway,"" said the Adviser to the Head of the President's Office. According to Mykhailo Podolyak, the issue of the status of certain districts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions is proposed to be included in a separate item, which will be considered within the negotiations between the Presidents of Ukraine and Russia. ""All controversial issues have been more or less discussed, our proposals have been made,"" said the Adviser to the Head of the President's Office."
Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Folketing,2022-03-29T15:45:00Z,"Mr. Speaker! Mrs. Prime Minister!  Members of the Government and the Folketing! Danish people! 40 missiles. Every day, Russian troops use so many different but equally deadly missiles against our state, against Ukraine. This is the average number per day. 40. More than 1,370 missiles have been used in just over a month of Russia's full-scale invasion of our land. This morning the Russian missiles hit one of our southern cities - Mykolaiv. The city of shipbuilders. Absolutely peaceful city, which dreamed of only one thing - to regain the glory of the center of shipbuilding in the Black Sea region. As a result of this strike, the building of the regional administration was destroyed. It is known that seven people were killed and 22 were wounded. Debris removal continues. The Mykolaiv region residents didn't have any military dreams. They posed no threat to Russia. But they, like all other Ukrainians, believe me, have become a target for Russian troops. For missiles, bombs, rocket artillery, mortars. The total number of means of destruction that Russian troops have already used against our people on our land is simply impossible to count. But we can say that the intensity and brutality of the hostilities against us have reached a level even higher than during World War II. The most devastating war for Europe. A month of hostilities - and we already have not one or two, but a whole black list of cities that were completely destroyed by Russian bombing. In dozens of other cities, towns and small villages, residential areas were partially burned, infrastructure was destroyed and enterprises where people worked were blown up. Living, ordinary people. 773 educational institutions - universities, schools, kindergartens - were destroyed. 773. Imagine! And dozens of hospitals, churches, even memorials to Holocaust victims have become targets... The goal of Russian troops in this war is to completely destroy any basis for the normal life of the Ukrainian people. The occupiers are deliberately making sure that nothing is left of Ukraine. Only ruins. Only refugees. More than 10 million Ukrainians have already fled their homes due to the hostilities. Almost 4 million Ukrainians have left our country, most of them women and children. The stories of these people are full of horror. There are still many burned and shot cars on the roadsides in the areas where the Russian military came. Hundreds and hundreds of such cars, what's left of them. The occupiers were killing civilians even when they were just trying to escape! Along with our immigrants in Europe and the western regions of Ukraine, there are children who were simply picked up on the road near the corpses of their parents. Up to 100,000 people remain in our city of Mariupol, which has been blocked by Russian troops for more than three weeks. While there was snow people melted it to get water. All this time we can't deliver humanitarian goods to the city - they are simply blocked. Water, food, medicine. Everything is blocked by the Russian military. More than 90 percent of all buildings in Mariupol were completely destroyed by shelling and bombs. But Russian aircraft strike without stopping. They purposefully blow up even shelters, although they know for sure that peaceful people are hiding there - women, children, old people. What Russian troops are doing to Mariupol is a crime against humanity that is being committed live in front of the eyes of the entire planet. Why is this even possible? Why can't the world stop this flow of Russia's war crimes ongoing since February 24 this year? The answer is very simple and cynical. People who make decisions in Russia hope that they will get away with it. Sanctions? They think they can be bypassed. An embargo on Russian oil? They see that this is still nothing more than just talking about this important topic. And concern, constant concern. An international tribunal? They know that it takes years to bring specific perpetrators to justice. That is why we appeal to you and to the entire democratic community of the world: sanctions against Russia must be strengthened! Constantly. We need to give up Russian oil, we need to block trade with the Russian Federation, we need to close ports for Russian ships. And this must be the solidarity policy of the European Union, of all the member states. Everyone. It is you, in Denmark, in the country where the basic principles of the European Union, the Copenhagen criteria, come from, who can feel most of all how important it is for all-European solidarity to work for pressure on Russia. Because this pressure is for Russia to seek peace. This is pressure to give the necessary protection to all the basic values on which life in Europe is built and which are now completely trampled by Russia in Ukraine. What can be said about the protection of human rights or freedom on the European continent, if there is no such crime against people and humanity in general not committed by the occupiers? They deport our people to Russia by force, rape women, underage girls, and engage in looting. They have already taken more than two thousand children to Russia, and we do not know where they are, we do not even have a complete list of these children. Do they have families? How will they then find their loved ones? It would be simply impossible for a normal person to imagine the level of evil that was brought to our land! That is why I call on you to raise the issue of solidarity in the defense of freedom, in the defense of humanity at the level of the European Union. There can be no Russian branches in Europe that split the EU from within, that are trying to help Russia make as much money as possible even now. Everyone knows very well who in the European Union opposes humanity and common sense. Who does nothing at all to help establish peace in Ukraine. This must stop, and Europe must stop listening to any excuses from official Budapest. I am grateful to Denmark for its principled position. Thank you to everyone. I am grateful to your people who help Ukraine and help Ukrainians. To your companies that have decided to leave the Russian market. Maersk, Jysk, Lego, Vestas, DSV, Arla Foods, Carlsberg and many other companies who have made this important decision. But I ask you not to stop, to be leaders in Europe in promoting the decisions we really need. Long before this war, it was clear that humanity should reduce the use of fossil fuels. The era of coal and oil has caused huge damage to the environment, to our planet as a whole. Green technologies and green energy have become a logical and just answer to this challenge. European policy is already aimed at reducing the consumption of environmentally hazardous resources. But Russia's aggression against Ukraine and against everything that life in Europe is built on is an argument to accelerate green transformation on the continent. Europe must give up Russian oil, give up as soon as possible! Because it is the crazy income from energy resources that allows the Russian leadership to be bold. Violate generally accepted rules. Promote hatred against other nations, against us and destroy the lives of neighboring countries. If you had to find the complete opposite of what is called the ""Law of Jante"" in your country, it would be the ""Law of Russian Oil"". I am confident that together - only together with all Europeans, with all responsible states on the planet - we will be able to overcome this catastrophe. We will be able to return to peace. We will be able to live together in a European family. I hope this will happen very soon. But it depends on how consistent and principled we remain at this time. At a time when the war continues. However, we have no right now to think only of war. We know there will be peace. We know that we will be able to return to a normal, peaceful life. That is why I want to invite you to join our initiative to rebuild Ukraine after the war, after our victory. We invite your companies, your specialists, your state. Knowing your potential, your creative economic power, I offer your country to take patronage over one of our beautiful regions - after the war. Of course, after the war. Mykolaiv, the city of shipbuilders, can become such a city, such a region, which will unite you and us even more. Which Denmark can help rebuild. Ladies and Gentlemen! Danish people! Now is the dark time in Ukraine. Thousands of candles are placed in our churches in memory of the people whose lives were taken by this war. I know that for you the warm light of candles is a synonym of home comfort, ordinary good human life. Life, which today has become an unattainable dream for many in Ukraine. The Russian invasion continues. But I believe, I know, that we can return to peace. And I ask you to light a candle at home tonight in memory of all Ukrainians whose lives were taken by Russian aggression. May the memory of all who gave their lives for our freedom, world freedom, live forever! Glory to Ukraine!"
A group of experts will be established at the Office of the President of Ukraine to analyze the observance of sanctions against Russia - Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-03-29T09:33:00Z,"An expert group will be set up at the Office of the President of Ukraine within a week to monitor and analyze compliance with international sanctions against Russia. After all, it is important for Ukraine that sanctions packages against the Russian Federation are effective. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his address. “It is important for us that the sanctions packages are effective and substantial enough, given what is already being done against Ukraine by the Russian Federation. If the sanctions packages are weak or do not work enough, if they can be circumvented, it creates a dangerous illusion for the Russian leadership that they can continue to afford what they are doing now. And Ukrainians pay for it with their lives. Thousands of lives,” the Head of State emphasized. “Therefore, starting this week, we are creating a group of experts at the President's Office - Ukrainian and international, who will constantly analyze the sanctions against Russia - what they really influence,” he said. As Volodymyr Zelenskyy explained, sanctions should work as intended, without any possibility of circumventing them. The President also stressed that Ukraine would not agree with the passive sanctions position of some entities regarding Russia. “There should be no ""suspended"" sanctions packages - that if the Russian troops do something, then there will be some answer… We went through this story last year when we said that strong preventive sanctions against Russia were needed to prevent an invasion. The preventive package was not made. A full-scale war has begun,” the President noted. According to him, there are now many hints at the possibility of tightening sanctions, such as an embargo on Russian oil supplies to Europe, if Russia uses chemical weapons in Ukraine. “Doesn't everything that the Russian military is doing and has already done deserve an oil embargo? Don't phosphorus bombs deserve that? Don't the shelled chemical production or nuclear power plant deserve that?” Volodymyr Zelenskyy concluded."
"We have to fight, we can't burn emotions so as not to burn out - address by the President of Ukraine",2022-03-28T23:55:00Z,"Wise people of a strong country! Today we have good news. Our defenders are advancing in the Kyiv region, regaining control over Ukrainian territory. Irpin was liberated. Well done! I am grateful to everyone who worked for this result. The occupiers are pushed away from Irpin. Pushed away from Kyiv. However, it is too early to talk about security in this part of our region. The fighting continues. Russian troops control the north of Kyiv region, have the resources and manpower. They are trying to restore the destroyed units. The level of their losses, even at 90%, is not an argument for them to stop. Hundreds and hundreds of units of burned and abandoned enemy equipment do not convince them that this will happen to everyone. Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv regions, Donbas, southern Ukraine - the situation everywhere remains tense, very difficult. This is a ruthless war against our nation, against our people, against our children. As of today, 143 children are known to have died. Mariupol remains blocked. Russian troops did not allow any humanitarian corridor to be organized today, they did not allow ""silence"". Therefore, the situation must now be perceived in a balanced, wise way. As much as possible. Without excessive euphoria from success. But also without getting yourself worked up. We still need time. We still need weapons. We still have to fight, we have to be patient. We can't burn emotions right now. We can't set expectations too high. Just so as not to burn out. I spoke with the leaders of the partner countries. It was a very active diplomatic day. Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Johnson, Prime Minister of Canada Trudeau, Chancellor of Germany Scholz, Prime Minister of Italy Draghi and President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev. We agreed with Britain to further support our defense and strengthen sanctions against the Russian Federation. Canada also supports a tougher response from the world to the catastrophe created by Russian troops in Ukrainian cities. In a conversation with German Chancellor Scholz, I also paid considerable attention to the need to increase sanction pressure on Russia. I thanked the President of Azerbaijan for the humanitarian support provided to Ukraine, informed about the state of affairs in the territories where Russian troops entered. Italy has agreed to become one of the guarantors of Ukraine's security in the relevant new system of guarantees that we are elaborating. I will continue this activity tomorrow. I will talk to other world leaders. I will work with international organizations, with the nations of Europe and the world. Ukraine cannot and will not agree with the passive sanctions position of some entities towards Russia. There should be no ""suspended"" sanctions packages - that if the Russian troops do something, then there will be some answer... We went through this story last year when we said that strong preventive sanctions against Russia were needed to prevent an invasion. The preventive package was not made. A full-scale war has begun. There are now many hints and warnings that sanctions will be tightened, such as an embargo on Russian oil supplies to Europe, if Russia uses chemical weapons. There are simply no words. Just think about what it all came down to. Waiting for chemical weapons... We, living people, have to wait… Doesn't everything that the Russian military is doing and has already done deserve an oil embargo? Don't phosphorus bombs deserve that? Don't the shelled chemical production or nuclear power plant deserve that? It is important for us that the sanctions packages are effective and substantial enough, given what is already being done against Ukraine by the Russian Federation. If the sanctions packages are weak or do not work enough, if they can be circumvented, it creates a dangerous illusion for the Russian leadership that they can continue to afford what they are doing now. And Ukrainians pay for it with their lives. Thousands of lives. Therefore, starting this week, we are creating a group of experts at the President's Office - Ukrainian and international, who will constantly analyze the sanctions against Russia - what they really influence. Our goal is for the sanctions to work as intended. And so that there is no possibility to circumvent them. This must be a goal for the whole democratic world, without exception. No exception. During the week I will speak in the parliaments of the partner countries: Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Greece, Australia. It is important that these are speeches not only in front of politicians, but also in front of societies. In front of millions of people who want to hear Ukraine and are ready to hear it to help and support. Who feel that we are fighting for our common freedom. One for all people on our earth. I will emphasize everywhere that no one has the right to use the lives of Ukrainians to save any income in Russia or income common with Russia. And Ukrainians should not die just because someone cannot find enough courage to hand over the necessary weapons to Ukraine. Fear always makes you an accomplice. If someone is afraid of Russia, if he or she is afraid to make the necessary decisions that are important to us, in particular for us to get planes, tanks, necessary artillery, shells, it makes these people responsible for the catastrophe created by Russian troops in our cities, too. Because if you could save, you had to save. The peoples of Europe, the peoples of the world will definitely hear and support me. And all politicians should think now what they will have left if they do not correspond to the position of their people. And finally. Already traditional. Just before delivering this address to you, dear Ukrainians, I signed two important decrees on awarding servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with state awards. At the request of our Commander-in-Chief, 302 of our defenders are awarded. I am grateful to all of you for your service! Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"
Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke with Ukrainian journalists creating the United News TV marathon,2022-03-28T01:03:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke in a video conference mode with Ukrainian journalists, who create a continuous round-the-clock telethon ""United News"" and tell citizens the truth. The Head of State noted the honest and united work of the media representatives. ""Now, during the war - terrible, tragic, but for Ukraine definitely victorious - you really are an army. A large, powerful army. I believe that today you are a great hope, a foundation, one of those whales on which a man in an ordinary Ukrainian town stands, a man who stops tanks with his bare hands. Today, people like you are holding on to the truth that the Russians do not have,” the President said. He supported the proposal of journalists to increase the participation of government officials and MPs in the telethon in order to better communicate government initiatives. The President stressed that the Ukrainian authorities are constantly in dialogue with representatives of Ukraine's partner countries. He thanked journalists for revealing to the world the image of Ukraine, which has been undisclosed so far. ""I want everything we do, everything you do, everything people do, our military, and all those victims were not in vain,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The President expressed his conviction that Ukraine would definitely win the war. ""We have definitely become leaders who have agency in the world. And we are not behind the scenes. It seems important to me. It is important that Ukraine has ceased to be a part of the Russian Federation for the whole world,"" the President said."
"The week is planned to be very busy, so no one will be able to hide the Ukrainian interest somewhere in political offices - address by the President of Ukraine",2022-03-28T00:38:00Z,"Strong people of our strong country! Today is the day when we see again and again how far we are from the Russian Federation. Imagine, they were frightened there in Moscow because of my interview to Russian journalists. To those of them who can afford to tell the truth. When journalists were preparing to publish our interview - and we spoke with them this afternoon - the Russian censorship agency came out with a threat. That's what they wrote - they demand not to publish the conversation. It would be ridiculous if it wasn't so tragic. They destroyed freedom of speech in their state, they are trying to destroy the neighboring state. They portray themselves as global players. And they themselves are afraid of a relatively short conversation with several journalists. Well, if there is such a reaction, then we are doing everything right, then they are nervous. Apparently, they have seen that their citizens have more and more questions about the state of affairs in their country. The maximum contrast is my conversation with our favorite Ukrainian TV media representatives. I held a zoom conference with almost five hundred of our media representatives who are creating a telethon ""United News"". I am grateful to them. Although we were limited in time, we talked quite thoroughly. I felt that everyone cares about Ukraine, cares about us and you, cares about our future. I wrote down a lot of questions and suggestions - we will work them out. Today I supported the global marathon for peace in Ukraine. Not just a television one. In dozens of cities around the world, people gathered in support of our state, in support of freedom. That's a pleasure! An impressive number of people in the squares of Europe, on other continents. And this is extremely important. Because when people are in the square, politicians will no longer pretend not to hear us and you, not to hear Ukraine. I will continue to appeal to the parliaments of other countries. The week is planned to be very busy from a diplomatic point of view. Therefore, no one will be able to hide the Ukrainian interest somewhere in political offices or in bureaucratic loopholes. We will not let anyone forget about our cities, about Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities that the Russian militaries are destroying. More and more people in the world are on the side of Ukraine, on the side of good in this battle with evil. And if politicians don't know how to follow people, we will teach them. This is the basis of democracy and our national character. Once again I want to thank our people in Kherson, Kakhovka, Slavutych and other cities who do not stop resisting the occupiers. If the occupiers had temporarily entered Ukrainian cities, it only means that they would have to leave. And I want to remind those phenomenal fools who are trying to cooperate with Russian troops that they are leaving their own people behind. What will they do to other people's traitors? I would tell them: think about it. But I know that these people don’t have anything to think with. Otherwise they would not have become traitors. Of course, this week we will work for new sanctions against the Russian Federation, against the aggression, sanctions that are needed as long as Russian troops remain on the territory of Ukraine. A new round of negotiations is ahead, because we are looking for peace. Really. Without delay. As I was informed, there is an opportunity and a need for a face-to-face meeting already in Turkey. This is not bad. Let's look at the result. Our priorities in the negotiations are known. Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt. Effective security guarantees for our state are mandatory. Our goal is obvious - peace and the restoration of normal life in our native state as soon as possible. The Armed Forces of our state are holding back the occupiers, and in some areas they are even taking steps forward. Well done. The courage of our defenders, how wisely they behave on the battlefield... This is so important that no words of gratitude will be enough. But again and again I never tire of thanking. To each of our defenders... To all who fight for our future, for our children, for our people. I signed decrees conferring the title of Hero of Ukraine upon 15 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 3 of them posthumously. As well as a decree on state awards to 142 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and 5 servicemen of the Department of State Protection of Ukraine. It is a great honor for me to sign such decrees. May the memory of all our heroes live forever. May the memory of everyone who gave life for Ukraine, for us, live forever. Glory to you all! Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"
President: “Denazification” and demilitarization of Ukraine is not discussed at all in talks with Russia ,2022-03-28T00:22:00Z,"The most important issues in the negotiations with Russia are security guarantees, neutrality and Ukraine's nuclear-free status; ""denazification"" and demilitarization are not discussed at all, said President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an interview for Russian media from ""Zygar"" YouTube channel, ""Rain"" TV channel, ""Meduza"" portal, ""Kommersant"" and ""Novaya Gazeta"". The Head of State noted that at the beginning of the talks the Russian Federation issued a public ultimatum. It contained the same items that were discussed in the media, in particular the so-called denazification and demilitarization. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, this was an informational throw-in that Russia usually resorts to when it delays negotiations, but wants to pretend that the process is ongoing and something is being done. We do not discuss ""denazification"" and demilitarization at all. I said that we will not sit at the negotiating table at all if we talk about some kind of demilitarization, some kind of ""denazification"". For me, these are completely incomprehensible things,"" the President said. At the same time, he noted that the issues of guarantees of security, neutrality, nuclear-free status of our country remain the most important, as Russia calls NATO enlargement one of the reasons for invading Ukraine. The Head of State noted that this issue has been deeply elaborated, and Ukraine is ready to agree on it only if it has guarantees fixed on paper. ""I want it not to be another piece of paper like the Budapest Memorandum. We are interested in turning this paper into a meaningful agreement, which will be signed by all guarantors,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Verification of this document must also be carried out in the parliaments of the guarantor countries, and a referendum on this issue must be held in Ukraine. ""The Russian side needs assurances that this will happen. Therefore, the referendum. Because only the people can decide that there can be such a status and such guarantors. The referendum will take place in a few months, and the amendments to the Constitution will take at least a year. According to our current legislation,"" the President stated. At the same time, the Head of State stressed that holding such a referendum will be possible only after the complete withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of Ukraine. After all, when active hostilities continue in the country and troops of another state are present, ""no one will ever recognize the results of this referendum."" ""We must have agreements with President Putin. The guarantors will not sign anything if the troops are not withdrawn,"" he said. ""We met and agreed. Our agreement with him. With signatures, seals, even blood, doesn’t matter. And that's enough to start the process of troops withdrawal. The troops must be withdrawn, the guarantors will sign everything, and all this will start working. Ratifications in parliaments, a referendum in several months, and only then - amendments to the Constitution,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy, adding that his personal meeting with President Vladimir Putin is needed for that. As for the issue of the Russian language in Ukraine, the President believes that it can be resolved through mutual respect for the languages of all neighboring countries, which should also be documented. ""In general, I would like to cut off this constant argument about language. We all speak the way we want and the language we want. We have more than 100 nationalities in the country. That's why I said: only a mirror respect for the history, languages, cultural values of all neighbors. I accept that. I am sure that our people will accept it if they want. Because all this will be decided one way or another by the people, the voters,"" he said. The President stressed that every next day of the war calls into question the use of the Russian language in Ukraine in general. ""People themselves will not want to perceive and speak this language, watch movies and so on. Especially when they try to instill love for the language through blood, as happened in the case of Ukraine. People themselves will not want that,"" he said. As the Head of State explained, if any national minority wants to open an educational or other institution, make publications in its own language, there should be mirror steps regarding the Ukrainian language. ""Respect for the languages of neighboring nations. I am interested in such an agreement, I want to sign it. I want to sign it with all neighboring countries. I am interested in Russia, Hungary, Poland - we have many historical issues, Romania and so on. We have many national minorities. And this agreement will be enough to respect certain languages both inside the country and abroad. Therefore, the issue of language, I am sure, will be off the agenda, because it will be resolved,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy summed up."
"In Ukraine, a special award will be given to corporations that quickly and completely left Russia - Andriy Yermak",2022-03-27T22:36:00Z,"International corporations that have left the Russian market fairly quickly and completely will be awarded a special Peace Award by the Office of the President of Ukraine. This was announced by Head of the Office of the President Andriy Yermak. ""With great gratitude from the Ukrainian people at this turning point in our history. They deserve the respect of Ukrainians and people around the world. After all, indifference and silence are complicity,"" he stressed. Andriy Yermak noted that Ukraine continues to work actively with global brands for them to leave the Russian market. ""Our goal is not a single penny to the budget of the aggressor country. Quite a few companies have already supported Ukraine and are leaving the Russian market. And I am convinced that those who still have doubts must make the right choice. It is impossible to support war crimes, it is inadmissible to conduct trade with war criminals and make money on the killing of civilians,"" said the Head of the President's Office. Andriy Yermak is convinced that the ""Peace Award"" is very important today, because we live in a critical moment when the issue is point-blank: to support the evil that kills women and children, or to choose a democratic world."
Ukrainian servicemen in Mariupol are not ready to leave their wounded and dead brothers-in-arms in the city - President ,2022-03-27T22:15:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the defenders of Mariupol had a choice to leave the city and save their lives, but they did not want to leave their wounded brothers-in-arms and the bodies of the dead there. The Head of State spoke about this in an interview for Russian media from ""Zygar"" YouTube channel, ""Rain"" TV channel, ""Meduza"" portal, ""Kommersant"" and ""Novaya Gazeta"". ""There are our troops inside (the city of Mariupol - ed.). Where Russian troops can enter, they have entered. They did not enter certain parts of the city. Because there are our men who refused to leave despite their appeals,"" he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that he regularly communicates with the defenders of Mariupol and members of their families. ""Every two days I get in touch for sure… I also told them that I understand everything, we will definitely come back, but if you feel that you need to leave and you feel that it is right and that you can survive, do it. I understand what it looks like for the military, but do it. I gave them that choice. And they said: we can't, the wounded are here, we will not leave the wounded. Moreover, they said they would not leave the dead,"" the President said. The Head of State also said that there was an attempt to agree with the Russian side on the removal of the bodies of killed soldiers and civilians lying in the open air, but such removal was not allowed. ""The reality is that the city is blocked by the Russian military, all entrances and exits from Mariupol are blocked, the port is mined. The humanitarian catastrophe in the city is obvious. Because food, medicine, and water can't be delivered. The Russian troops are shelling humanitarian convoys and killing drivers,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. According to him, due to the shelling, many humanitarian convoys returned without reaching Mariupol. The President also confirmed that in the framework of the agreements, people were leaving the city using civilian transport, but Russia also organized the forcible removal of Mariupol residents to the occupied territories. ""According to our data, more than 2,000 children were deported. Which means they were abducted. Because we do not know the exact locations of all these children. There were children with and without parents. It's a catastrophe, it's horrible,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. According to him, these people are being taken by the Russian side to replenish the ""exchange fund""."
"After the Russian invasion, a global split between Ukrainians and Russians took place - President of Ukraine",2022-03-27T20:57:00Z,"After the beginning of the full-scale armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, a deep historical and cultural split between Ukrainians and Russians took place, which is unlikely to be overcome in the coming years. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an interview for Russian media from ""Zygar"" YouTube channel, ""Rain"" TV channel, ""Meduza"" portal, ""Kommersant"" and ""Novaya Gazeta"". The Head of State stressed that after February 24, Ukrainians began to treat Russians much worse, losing the emotional component of attitude not only to Russia itself, but also to the people of this country. ""A global historical and cultural split took place during this month. It's not just a war, I think it's much worse,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The President noted that some Russians were forced to leave their country in protest against the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but the majority of the population supports the actions of the Russian authorities. ""I think this is the worst disappointment that has happened. Disappointment that turned into hatred of the nations. I have no answer as to how it can be returned, there is no answer as to whether it will ever return,"" the head of state said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that the Russian occupiers are committing horrific crimes, destroying the cities and villages of Ukraine, leaving no infrastructure. ""They enter. If the local government or someone does not want that - the local government is abducted. People are starting to shout something - everything is burned out,"" the President said. According to the President, such actions will provoke the growing hatred of Ukrainians for everything related to Russia, including the culture and language of this country. ""Vladimir Putin has done the worst for the Russian language. I believe the damage is irreparable. Of course, people outside of Russia will sometimes be embarrassed to speak Russian in any society. This was the case after the war, as a result of which a specific aggressor was recognized in the world,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The President of Ukraine stressed that before the war some Ukrainians were loyal to Russia, but now, when the aggressor destroyed their cities and killed their relatives, this attitude has changed to hatred."
"Volodymyr Zelenskyy: Ukraine is ready to exchange Russian prisoners of war, but it seems that the Russian side is not very interested in it",2022-03-27T20:34:00Z,"The Ukrainian side is ready to exchange Russian prisoners of war for Ukrainian prisoners of war before the end of hostilities. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an interview for Russian media from ""Zygar"" YouTube channel, ""Rain"" TV channel, ""Meduza"" portal, ""Kommersant"" and ""Novaya Gazeta"". ""Lists are being compiled. Our military, I know, made lists. There are lists of all those who are in captivity. I don't know if everyone is interested in them. Politicians, I think, are not very interested in them. I'm just not sure that the Russian side needs these lists,"" the Head of State said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that he stood for exchanging prisoners of war without waiting for the end of the war. ""It is not necessary to act according to some generally accepted canons: like let's wait until the end of the war, or let’s capture more... I do not understand that. I believe that there is an agreement to exchange everyone for everyone, we have this number - let's exchange for this number. Let’s not measure: 10 for 10, 11 for 11,” the President said. He also noted that Ukraine does not want to leave the corpses of Russian soldiers on its territory, but wants to hand them over to the relatives of the dead. ""They (the Russian side - ed.) first refused, then offered us some bags... It all looks like... You know, even when a dog or a cat dies, people don't do so. These are garbage bags. I don't understand what people think, what the parents of these children think,"" the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that for him, as the President of a warring country, such an attitude is unacceptable even towards soldiers of an enemy state. ""It's not cattle. And why is it dreadful? Because if this is the attitude towards their own people, then what is the attitude towards everyone else? And we are definitely not “friends” for the Russian government,"" he concluded."
"Russia has failed to destabilize the political situation in Ukraine, so its armed aggression is unsuccessful - President",2022-03-27T20:28:00Z,"The Russian Federation has been trying to destabilize the political situation in Ukraine for several years, but these attempts have failed, so the armed aggression against our state has not achieved its goals. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an interview for Russian media from ""Zygar"" YouTube channel, ""Rain"" TV channel, ""Meduza"" portal, ""Kommersant"" and ""Novaya Gazeta"". The Head of State stressed that Russia was making efforts to destabilize the situation in Ukraine through the activities of certain political parties, which, among other things, participated in local elections. The President noted that Russia has chosen the tactics of victory of pro-Russian forces in the regions of our state and even bought local organizations of some of them. ""After that, we saw the first steps - in certain local, district or regional councils, they came up with ultimatums: to block, to remove representatives of the ruling party somewhere. Somewhere they insisted that certain reforms should not be applied, as they are moving towards decentralization of power and will figure it out themselves,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Head of State noted that these forces of Russian influence were trying to initiate early elections to the Verkhovna Rada to provoke political chaos in Ukraine. ""This destabilization was necessary in order to split the majority with strong regional governance. Chaos in the economy and instability of the political spirit in Ukraine would lead to escalation on the part of the Russian Federation,"" the President said. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, such destabilization could have greatly simplified Russia's plans to occupy Ukraine, but destabilization has not taken place. According to the President, the political leadership of the Russian Federation may have received false predictions that the Ukrainian people will meet the occupiers ""with flowers and smiles"" and the current government allegedly has no support in society. ""And then, when they saw that things were going a little wrong, of course, the parallel solution was to neutralize those who stabilize the situation in power. And when there is a war, who can guarantee stability? During martial law, only the President can by virtue of his powers,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, explaining why there were forceful attempts to eliminate him."
"Russian troops are destroying everything that makes us a nation, but they will be held accountable for that - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-03-26T23:31:00Z,"Free people of a free country! Free Slavutych who will not be conquered by the invaders! Today we were all with you - on your streets, in your protest. And all together we tell the occupiers one thing: go home while you can still walk. The Russian invaders entered Slavutych and faced the same reaction there as in the south of our state, as in the east of our country. Ukraine is united in its desire to live freely, to live independently and for the sake of its own dreams, not other people's sick fantasies. Every day of our struggle for Ukraine, every manifestation of our resistance in all areas the occupiers have entered so far proves that Ukraine is a state full of life, which has historical roots and moral foundations throughout its territory. Nothing they do will help the occupiers in the Ukrainian territory they temporarily entered. Disconnection of our television and activation of passionate nonsense speeches by Moscow TV presenters, leaflets with propaganda, distribution of rubles. Rubles, which in Russia will soon be weighed instead of assessing them at face value. Bribing outcasts whom the occupiers are looking for in all the dumps to portray the allegedly pro-Russian government will not help as well. The answer to Russian troops will be one - hatred and contempt. And our Armed Forces of Ukraine will inevitably come. That is why ordinary Ukrainian peasants take captive the pilots of downed Russian planes that fall to our land. That is why our ""tractor troops"" - Ukrainian farmers take Russian equipment in the fields and give it to our Armed Forces of Ukraine. In particular, the latest models that Russia has tried to keep secret. And now the occupiers leave them on our land and just run away... Actually, they do the right thing. Because it is better for them to escape than to die. And there are not and will not be other alternatives. Everyone in Ukraine has united and has been devoting all their energy to the defense of our state for more than a month already. Together with the Armed Forces, together with all our defenders, together with our National Guard. I would like to once again congratulate the National Guard of Ukraine on its day with great respect. I am sincerely grateful for everything you do to protect the state, to protect Ukrainians! Thank you for all the steps to victory that will come and that were made possible thanks to you. Today I presented awards to soldiers of the National Guard who distinguished themselves in battles with the Russian occupiers. I also awarded the rank of brigadier general to five colonels of the National Guard of Ukraine. In total, during the full-scale war since February 24, 476 soldiers of the National Guard have been awarded state awards already. I also spoke today with Polish President Andrzej Duda. Twice. About our people who found protection in Poland. And the need to strengthen our common security. Security of our states. Security for all Europeans actually. What is the price of this security? This is very specific. These are planes for Ukraine. These are tanks for our state. This is anti-missile defense. This is anti-ship weaponry. This is what our partners have. This is what is covered with dust at their storage facilities. After all, this is all for freedom not only in Ukraine - this is for freedom in Europe. Because it cannot be acceptable for everyone on the continent if the Baltic states, Poland, Slovakia and the whole of Eastern Europe are at risk of a clash with the Russian invaders. At risk only because they left only one percent of all NATO aircraft and one percent of all NATO tanks somewhere in their hangars. One percent! We did not ask for more. And we do not ask for more. And we have already been waiting for 31 days! So who runs the Euro-Atlantic community? Is it still Moscow because of intimidation? Partners need to step up assistance to Ukraine. These are the words: partners need! Because this is the security of Europe. And this is exactly what we agreed on in Kyiv when the three prime ministers of Eastern European countries, as well as Mr. Kaczynski, arrived in our capital. It was in mid-March. Today, immediately after the conversation with the President of Poland, I contacted the defenders of Mariupol. I am in constant contact with them. Their determination, their heroism and resilience are impressive. I am grateful to each of them! I wish at least a percentage of their courage to those who have been thinking for 31 days how to transfer a dozen or two of planes or tanks… And, by the way, we talked today with our military in Mariupol, with our heroes who defend this city, in Russian. Because there is no language problem in Ukraine and there never was. But now you, the Russian occupiers, are creating this problem. You are doing everything to make our people stop speaking Russian themselves. Because the Russian language will be associated with you. Only with you. With these explosions and killings. With your crimes. You are deporting our people. You are bullying our teachers, forcing them to repeat everything after your propagandists. You are taking our mayors and Ukrainian activists hostage. You are placing billboards in the occupied territories with appeals (they appeared today) not to be afraid to speak Russian. Just think about what it means. Where Russian has always been a part of everyday life, like Ukrainian, in the east of our state, and where you are turning peaceful cities into ruins today. Russia itself is doing everything to ensure that de-russification takes place on the territory of our state. You are doing it. In one generation. And forever. This is another manifestation of your suicide policy. Our representatives - the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Defense of Ukraine - met today in Poland with colleagues from the United States. They were joined by US President Joseph Biden. As I was informed, the negotiations concerned, in particular, these vital interests, which I mentioned above. Concerned what we really need while this ping-pong continues - who should give us planes and other protection tools and how. Ukraine cannot shoot down Russian missiles using shotguns, machine guns, which are too much in supplies. And it is impossible to unblock Mariupol without a sufficient number of tanks, other armored vehicles and, of course, aircraft. All defenders of Ukraine know that. All defenders of Mariupol know that. Thousands of people know that - citizens, civilians who are dying there in the blockade. The United States knows that. All European politicians know. We told everyone. And this should be known as soon as possible by as many people on earth as possible. So that everyone understands who and why was simply afraid to prevent this tragedy. Afraid to simply make a decision. Vital decision. Of course, we have already seized a number of Russian tanks, which the military command of this country keeps sending to be burned here. However, the nations of the world will not understand for sure if the battlefield in Ukraine will be a larger supplier of tanks to protect freedom in Europe than our partners. Ukraine's position must be heard. I want to emphasize: this is not only our position. This is the position of the vast majority of Europe's population, the majority of Europeans. If someone does not believe me, look at current public opinion polls in the world. And if you do not want to hear the opinion of the people, then hear the strikes of Russian missiles hitting right next to the Polish border. Are you waiting for the roar of Russian tanks? I also spoke with Prime Minister of Bulgaria Kiril Petkov. In particular, about the humanitarian catastrophe due to the actions of Russian troops and how to save our people. I spoke today at the Doha Forum in the capital of Qatar. This is a respectable meeting that is important not only for the Islamic world, but also for many other countries in Latin America and Africa. These are the regions where Russian propaganda still has great influence. But we are working against lies all over the world. Let Russia know that the truth will not remain silent. And let every nation in the world feel the depth of Russia's injustice against Ukraine. Against everything that keeps the world within morality and humanity. The occupiers committed another crime against history. Against historical justice. Near Kharkiv, Russian troops in their branded inhuman style ""denazified"" the Holocaust Memorial in Drobytsky Yar. During World War II, the Nazis executed about 20,000 people there. 80 years later they are killed a second time. And Russia is doing it. The menorah in Drobytsky Yar destroyed by Russian projectiles today is another question to the entire Jewish community of the world: how many more crimes against our common memory of the Holocaust will be allowed to be committed by Russia on our Ukrainian land? Russian troops are deliberately killing civilians, destroying residential neighborhoods, targeting shelters and hospitals, schools and universities. Even churches, even Holocaust memorials! Russian troops receive just such orders: to destroy everything that makes our nation nation, our people - people, our culture - culture. This is exactly how the Nazis tried to capture Europe 80 years ago. This is exactly how the occupiers act in Ukraine. No one will forgive them. There will be responsibility. Just like 77 years ago. Most likely not in Nuremberg. But the meaning will be similar. You will see. Everyone will see. Everyone. We guarantee. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"
Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a video conference with Andrzej Duda,2022-03-26T19:57:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President of the Republic of Poland Andrzej Duda held a video conference. The President of Ukraine thanked his Polish counterpart for sheltering Ukrainian refugees. Andrzej Duda said that as of now, Poland has sheltered 2.3 million Ukrainians. According to him, the country provides them with everything they need. The presidents and representatives of their offices discussed the functioning of Ukraine's energy system in Europe's single energy network. The energy ministers of the two countries were instructed to continue consultations after the talks. Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated the need to prevent shelling of Ukrainian cities from the air. The President of Ukraine expressed disappointment that Soviet-made aircraft available in Eastern European countries, in particular Poland, have not yet been handed over to our state. Although both these countries and the United States have publicly stated their readiness to make such a decision. ""The price of delay with planes is thousands of lives of Ukrainians, which we are losing from missile and air strikes on peaceful Ukrainian cities,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. According to him, aircraft, tanks and long-range air defense systems would allow Ukraine to really defend freedom throughout our territory and drastically change the course of hostilities. ""If the partners do not help Ukraine with planes and tanks, and they have such opportunities, there is a high risk that Russian troops will pose not only a missile threat to the territory of our neighbors - friendly Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and the Baltic States, but also direct general military threat. On their borders, near their cities. And they will go further,"" the Ukrainian Head of State said. As the conversation between the Presidents was coming to an end, Lviv was hit by Russian missiles. Lviv is located 50 kilometers from the Polish border. After the conversation, Volodymyr Zelenskyy contacted the defenders of Mariupol who also said that the city was under devastating airstrikes. Nevertheless, the military assured that they are determined to defend Mariupol."
Ukraine insists on a system of security guarantees - Mykhailo Podolyak,2022-03-26T17:01:00Z,"One of the key elements of the negotiations on ending the aggressive war launched by the Russian Federation on the territory of Ukraine is the creation of a system of clear and reliable security guarantees for our state. This was stated by Advisor to the Head of the President's Office Mykhailo Podolyak in an interview for the German media Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. ""Ukraine insists on a system of security guarantees, which will include countries that are ready to provide these guarantees, including in the military sense. Many other things depend on it,"" he stressed. According to Mykhailo Podolyak, such a system of guarantees is impossible without the participation of the United States of America in the first place. The Advisor to the Head of the President's Office noted that there is some progress in the negotiations with the Russian side in the working subgroups, but in general the progress is not yet what the Ukrainian side would like it to be. He also stressed that Ukraine would not exchange situational success for global security instruments. ""The Russian side likes to organize a ""leak"" of some information, some versions of the talks in the media, hoping that in our country, where there is an open discussion, there will be speculation, emotions and conflicts,"" said Mykhailo Podolyak. According to him, the issue of territorial integrity is extremely important for our state. Therefore, such a difficult issue as the future of the temporarily occupied Crimea and ORDLO should be decided only by the Presidents of Ukraine and Russia. The Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President believes that the peace talks will begin to yield fruit when Russia realizes that it will suffer more losses from the continuation of this war than Ukraine. ""For this to happen, we need effective operation of our army. And this requires that our partners adequately help us. If you do not want to make a no-fly zone, give us air defense systems so that we can close the skies ourselves, so that our peaceful cities are not bombed. Second, give us weapons to unblock cities like Mariupol. Third, sanctions such as the oil embargo, maximum restrictions on financial transactions, etc. are needed,” Mykhailo Podolyak explained."
President awarded the National Guard soldiers who distinguished themselves in battles with the Russian aggressor,2022-03-26T16:02:00Z,"On the Day of the National Guard of Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded the NGU servicemen who showed personal courage and dedication in repelling the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against our state. ""I want to thank everyone for your service. For your work, for protecting our territorial integrity, sovereignty, all our families,"" he said. ""Please take care of yourself, take care of your families, take care of your children's health. All this is important and will be needed for us, for our future, which we are building and will build together with you,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy added, presenting the awards. In particular, the award was received by: NGU soldier Andriy Yesaultsev who showed courage during the evacuation of personnel from Antonov Airport. Major Oleksandr Solonko who defended Kyiv Airport and, despite heavy rocket fire from the enemy, kept the defense and destroyed an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group. During the battle, Oleksandr Solonko captured five saboteurs. Soldier Roman Bereza who showed courage during the fire contact with the paratroopers of the aggressor who fired at the military unit. Senior Lieutenant of the medical service Maryna Riazantseva who came under mortar fire from the occupiers near the village of Horenka, as a result of which a battle broke out with an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group. As a result of the projectile explosion, Maryna Riazantseva was shell shocked, but despite the pain continued to provide medical care to the wounded soldiers and evacuate them during the enemy shelling. Senior Sergeant Makym Tkach who saved the battle flag during the withdrawal of personnel from the location of the military unit.

According to Iryna Vereshchuk, Mariupol residents can refuel their cars for free in Berdyansk at 87B Melitopolske Highway.

We are working on it,"" Iryna Vereshchuk stressed. In the Luhansk region, evacuation buses and humanitarian aid will be sent from the city of Bakhmut. Agreed corridors: from the city of Rubizhne (meeting place - 11 Chekhova Street); from the urban-type settlement of Nyzhne (meeting place - 13 Parkova Street); from the city of Lysychansk (meeting place - GTV, quarter of 40 years of Victory, 324 Sosyury Street); from the city of Popasna (meeting place - 42 Pervomayska Street); from the city of Severodonetsk (meeting place - 28 Khimikiv Avenue) and from the city of Hirske (meeting place - 13 Haharyna Street). ""According to our information, the occupiers have planned a demonstration action today - they are going to forcibly deport ethnic Armenians, Azerbaijanis and Meskhetian Turks from the city of Kherson to the temporarily occupied Ukrainian Crimea... The Russians understand that they are losing control, so they resort to propaganda - take people to Crimea, which is still under their control. However, these steps are futile and criminal,"" said the Deputy Prime Minister. Iryna Vereshchuk stressed that Kherson residents are actively and massively protesting against the occupation. ""Kherson and Kherson residents, you are our heroes!"" she said."
"Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Doha Forum – 2022: Europe's refusal to purchase Russian oil and gas is only a matter of time, so it is necessary to increase energy production in the world",2022-03-26T12:14:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on energy-supplying countries, including Qatar, to increase energy production in order to deprive Russia of opportunities for energy blackmail and thus contribute to stabilizing the situation in Europe. He stated this during a speech in the format of a video conference at the Doha Forum – 2022. The Head of State addressed the participants of the event: ""The topic of this year's forum in the beautiful, peaceful and respectful city of Doha is the challenges for the new era. But, unfortunately, not everyone on our planet perceives reality adequately and understands that we need to prepare for new times. Russia, as we see, wants a time when peaceful coexistence of nations on equal terms was impossible on earth. Can we allow this?” He stressed that after a full-scale attack by Russia, which is 28 times bigger, Ukraine has been defending itself on the battlefield and couldn't find justice in the world for 31 days already. Russia, on the other hand, is threatening to use nuclear weapons, spreading this fear on the planet and ""boasting that it can destroy not only a nation, but also life on earth with nuclear weapons."" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed the need for real reform of international institutions and UN mechanisms to ensure security. ""So that someone 28 times bigger does not think he can do anything he wants. And that the nuclear status of the state does not serve as a permit for any injustice against other states,"" the President said. According to the President, Ukraine is a country of diversity and peaceful coexistence of ethnic groups and religions. More than a million Muslims live in our country, who are now also suffering from Russian bombing. ""In 31 days of this war, Russian strikes damaged at least 59 buildings of spiritual significance. Mosques, churches, religious educational institutions. More than 200 schools were destroyed or damaged. Dozens of hospitals. Russia does not stop even before the bombing of hospitals! Russian troops purposefully strike at places that ordinary civilians use as shelter,"" the President said. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, during the Russian invasion, about 10 million people, mostly women with children, have already become migrants in Ukraine, and more than 3.5 million Ukrainian citizens have been forced to go abroad in search of security. The food crisis will come after the migration crisis, said the President. After all, Ukraine is one of the world's most important food exporters. ""Wheat, oil, corn and other agricultural products from our country are the basis of stability and internal security of many countries in different parts of the world… Russian troops mine fields in Ukraine, blow up agricultural machinery, destroy fuel reserves needed for sowing. They blocked our seaports. Why are they doing this? Our state will have enough food. But the lack of exports from Ukraine will hit many nations in the Islamic world, Latin America and other parts of the world. Where some invaders still dream of going to strengthen their old privileges,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. He urged to unite the efforts to prevent food shortages in the world due to the war. In particular, by strengthening the sanctions policy against Russia. ""All the restrictions that have been imposed on Russia are aimed at only one thing: for Russia to start seeking peace, so that it does not pose global threats. I call on all states to join. Russia must seek peace. It must end the war against Ukraine. It must stop all attempts to break global stability and return to the world the old disgusting habits of those who sought colonies and instilled inequality,"" said the President. Also, in his opinion, the refusal of European countries to purchase Russian oil and gas is only a matter of time. ""The responsible states, in particular the State of Qatar, are reliable and reputable suppliers of energy resources. And they can contribute to stabilizing the situation in Europe. They can do much to restore justice. The future of Europe depends on your efforts! I urge you to increase energy production! So that Russia understands that no state should use energy as a weapon to blackmail the world,"" the President of Ukraine stressed. Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on the whole anti-war coalition to work even harder for Russia to seek peace. ""So that people in the world can really prepare for new times, for a new era. Instead of thinking about how to adapt to the return of the old horrors: wars of invasion, famine and despair that leads to uprisings,"" the President summed up."
The construction of temporary housing is envisaged within the new program of support for IDPs - Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-03-25T23:05:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the preparation of a program to support internally displaced persons, which provides for the construction of temporary housing for citizens who have fled the areas of hostilities. “Officials are preparing a new support program for our IDPs from the war zones. Regional administrations have been given a clear task to quickly allocate land for the construction of temporary housing for displaced persons. I want to emphasize once again - this is temporary housing. Once we establish peace, we will begin the immediate, large-scale reconstruction of our state. But now people need a temporary home. Their home. And it is better to have a home in Ukraine than somewhere abroad,” the Head of State emphasized. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, all the details of this support program will be presented by Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal."
Speech by Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak during the participation in the video meeting of the Atlantic Council,2022-03-25T22:27:00Z,"Dear Ambassador Herbst, dear ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for having me here. I'm grateful for the chance to talk to you. People of Ukraine are grateful to our American friends for all the help you provide. Both military and humanitarian. Thanks for your support. It’s really vital for us. Yesterday, after the NATO summit I was told a joke. The NATO acronym stands for Never Act, Talk Only! They say the joke is so old that it should be called vintage.  And now allow me to get to Ukrainian. Today, it’s the language of freedom. The language of victory. If this is true, then things are bad for us. More precisely, they are bad for NATO. Because if it reacted to Russia's aggression against itself in the same way as it had reacted to the invasion of Ukraine, Russian tanks would be standing near Dunkirk for a couple of weeks already. And someone - we know for sure, who exactly - would probably have to land in Normandy again soon. But NATO is lucky - these tanks are now being disposed of in Ukraine. But the thing is Ukraine is not made for this. Ukraine has other plans, its own plans. To develop. To build. To continue reforms. To improve life. These plans are not just paused. For thousands of people, they will never come true. They may never come true for our entire state. After all, the war that Russia is waging against us is not just a war for territory or resources. This is a punitive war. Caused by the desire to return the apostates who rebelled against the ""Russian world"". Or to destroy them. For the Putin regime, Ukraine is a heresy. Literally. And the war against it is a religious war. So this is a war of annihilation. Russia's goal is to destroy Ukraine. As a people living by their own customs. As a political nation that chooses its own values. As a sovereign state that determines its own path. There is no exaggeration in these words. They must be taken literally. Because this is exactly what the Russian leadership meant when it has been talking about ""one nation"" for years. About Ukraine as a ""historical phantom"" and ""not even a state"". Henry Kissinger, a man I respect very much, has grasped very clearly the essence of Russia's attitude toward Ukraine. I quote in the original language: “The West is trying to establish the legality of any established border. For Russia, Ukraine is part of the Russian patrimony”. Now the world is promoting the ""Give Peace a Chance"" campaign, and there are calls for reconciliation between Ukraine and Russia. We did not start this war. We want its end more than anyone in the world. We are making an incredible effort to do so. In particular, the diplomatic one. However, the word ""reconciliation"" is completely inappropriate here. It indicates parity and equality of the parties. We see an emphasis on supremacy on the part of Russia. And the intention to continue on the path of violence and destruction. The Kremlin's aggressive plans are failing. The blitzkrieg failed. No strategic task of the invading force was fulfilled even during the month of fighting. They believed that the invasion of Ukraine would be an easy walk. They believed that they would quickly stifle our desire for freedom. Well, they have a lot of experience in this. They have Berlin 53rd, Budapest 56th, Prague 68th… But they have forgotten that the CSTO is a pale shadow of the Warsaw Pact. Russia is a pale shadow of the USSR. But it still has very large resources. In particular human resources. Half a million soldiers subdued Czechoslovakia. 200,000 have been sent to seize Ukraine. Yet. And a new wave of invasion is approaching. And maybe it will be bigger. In Russia, covert mobilization continues. Russia's allies are trying to avoid participating in its aggression. But blackmail and provocations can still force them. And this means we will have to defend ourselves further. But it is already quite obvious: the Russian leadership has miscalculated about Ukraine. Miscalculated at each point. Because the line ""we will lay down our souls and bodies for our freedom"" is not just solemn words from our national anthem. This is the Ukrainian national idea. We do not just believe that freedom is the highest value. We know that. In 2014, this knowledge was embodied in the slogan ""Ukraine is Europe"". Of course, this is not about geography - everything is obvious about it. It's about values. But today Ukraine is the Grail of Europe. Without exaggeration. Because it is Ukraine who revives the principles that gave life to the current civilization of the West. You can't exchange freedom for comfort. You cannot buy resources for justice and human rights. Cannibalism cannot be justified by originality. You cannot be afraid to call evil evil. You can't be afraid of evil. We are not afraid. And this is what makes Ukraine an antagonist of Russia. The anti-Russia that Putin talks about all the time. And in this sense, our state is an indisputable existential threat to him. Because his loss in Ukraine will mean the collapse of the regime. And success will only strengthen it. Terror is the basis of his regime. Terror is the basis of Russian statehood. Terror is the basis of Russia's military strategy. Russia is a terrorist state. The Russian armed forces are destroying our cities not only because of technical backwardness and lack of high-precision ammunition. They are doing it to cause horror. Phosphorus bombs dropped on the Kyiv region are not about military superiority. The methodical destruction of Mariupol is not about military superiority. There were more people in Mariupol before the war than in Miami. Imagine Miami without water. Without access to medication. Without food. Imagine Miami being turned to dust every day. Together with residents who are not allowed to evacuate. Neighborhood after neighborhood. Schools. Theater. Maternity hospital. Without any military sense. Just to intimidate. They are destroying civilian infrastructure and using unconventional weapons to cause a humanitarian catastrophe. They resort to chemical and nuclear blackmail - the threat of environmental catastrophes due to sabotage at the captured Chornobyl and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants remains extremely high. They are hiding behind civilians. Tens of thousands of them are being taken hostage and taken to work in the depressed regions of Russia. They call it evacuation. In fact, it is an abduction. That is why I call on the partners: it is time to recognize the Russian Federation as a terrorist state. Officially. It is time to recognize the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation as a terrorist organization. It is time to recognize them as a criminal organization. But this, apparently, will not happen as long as the seat in the UN Security Council is illegally occupied by a state that has carried out aggression against one of the founding states of the United Nations. This will not happen as soon as the world's largest and most powerful defense alliance is most concerned about avoiding confrontation with a regime that has been breaking the world's security system for years. The attack on Ukraine has become a vivid completion of this process. That's why we have to endure. For ourselves. And for the world. Because it will only get worse. Unpunished tyrannies multiply lawlessness. They do not need the rule of law. They recognize only the rule of force. Russia understands only the language of power. Its success in Ukraine will only strengthen the Kremlin's claims. On the territory. On the restoration of the Soviet sphere of influence. On the right to dictate to other nations how to live. Ukraine will hold on. For us, this war is a people's war. Therefore, we will not give up our sovereignty or territories. But we cannot afford Pyrrhic victory. You can't afford that. Destroyed and bloodless Ukraine will cease to be what it is today. It will cease to be an advanced bastion of the European fortress. To survive, we need very specific things. You know what I'm talking about. But we have to remind people about it every time. I'll start with the simplest. It is very important to be in time in war. It is important to have time. The more the better. Give it to us. We really need to share intelligence in real time. A clear and complete picture of Russia's actions is very much needed. This is extremely important for our defense. Two factors are bringing our victory closer. The first is our resilience. Courage of every fighter. Every volunteer. Every citizen. The second has many names - Javelin, Stinger, Mark-19 and so on. But small arms and portable weapons, no matter how modern, are of limited effectiveness. Without a full-fledged Lend-Lease, without heavy weapons - long-range artillery, MLRS, etc. - the defensive war against Russia will turn into a guerrilla war. Simply due to the number of its mobilization reserves. This increases the risk of a humanitarian catastrophe and is guaranteed to increase the outflow of refugees. We must avoid this at any cost. Finally, we need to close the sky. Here we see several options. And they all depend primarily on the political will of the parties. The basic option is to transfer Soviet and Russian-made fighter jets and long-range air defense systems to Ukraine. Relevant reserves are in Poland, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Greece. They could hand them over to us, and the United States could strengthen their defense by providing a replacement. The temporary deployment of Patriot systems and air police missions could protect these countries from hostile actions and provocations from Russia due to the transfer of weapons to us. The vast majority of citizens of the United States and other countries stand for increasing support for Ukraine. Including the military support. And the number of such people is growing every week. It is time for politicians to listen to the opinion of their own people as soon as possible. Russia's success is ensured by fear. It is fear that motivates it to further aggression. It is restrained only by determination. And it's time to show it. Do not give in to blackmail. Don't give in to panic. Don't give in to terrorists. Ukraine will resist. Ukraine will continue to fight. Not only against the aggressor. But also for the future. For reliable guarantees of post-war security. We are not satisfied with any configuration that threatens the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. We will not be satisfied with a compromise on Russian terms. The victim of aggression must not pay for peace. The aggressor must be deprived of the opportunity to attack again. That is why we call on our partners and allies to find a format that will work effectively and for a long time. We have learned the lessons of the Budapest Memorandum. We have paid very dearly for them. This war has totally destroyed the entire old system of international security. We need to build a new one now. And Ukraine has proved that it deserves to be not only its participant and founder, but also its leading participant. And we continue to pay dearly for this right. And now it's time for the aggressor to pay. We call for the sanctions regime to be strengthened. We call for the strict observance of sanctions. We call for the introduction of mechanisms that will make it impossible for international companies to circumvent sanctions. Give the world a model that will deprive Russia of the opportunity to pursue an aggressive policy for many years to come. Not only after the end of the active phase of hostilities on the territory of Ukraine. We call for an embargo on Russian energy. We call for the reduction of opportunities of gray and black imports to Russia through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union. Russia is not a trade or agricultural state, but a military one, and its vocation is to be a menace to the world. These words belong to Emperor Alexander II. But every ruler of Russia could say them. And especially - the current ruler. It's time to stop this wheel of history. Before he does that. Everything will be Ukraine."
"By restraining Russian actions, our defenders are leading the Russian leadership to the idea: talk is necessary - address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-03-25T22:18:00Z,"Strong people of the best country in the world! I want to begin this address with words of congratulations. On my own behalf and on your behalf, on behalf of all our citizens of Ukraine to the employees of the Security Service of Ukraine. Today is their day. 30 years ago, on March 25, the Security Service of our state was founded. The Service has come a long way. And we all know that. But we also know that during the eight years of the war in Donbas and during the 30 days of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many members of the Security Service have shown themselves from the best - heroic - side. They have shown themselves principled, courageous and able to inflict losses on the enemy that the enemy does not expect. This is exactly what Ukraine needs now. I am grateful to all our heroes from the Security Service of Ukraine. I am grateful to everyone in the Service who during 30 years of our common history broke the plans of enemies and worked in the interests of the Ukrainian people only. Congratulations on the holiday! Respect to everyone! And we will always remember all the employees of the Service who died for Ukraine while performing tasks to counter Russian aggression. During this month of hostilities, 77 employees of the Security Service were awarded state awards. Two of them were posthumously awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. Both distinguished themselves in the battles near Makariv, Kyiv region. Thanks to their courageous actions, the enemy headquarters and more than 20 occupiers were destroyed. I can't tell you the names of our heroes. This is the specifics of the service. But I can say with confidence: the memory of them will truly be eternal! Today I signed a decree on state awards to 63 law enforcement officers of Ukraine. Seven of them were awarded posthumously. Police, rescuers, border guards, special service officials of the State Bureau of Investigation and employees of the Court Protection Service. Thank you to everyone! Over the past week, our heroic Armed Forces have dealt powerful blows to the enemy, significant losses. They say that the Minister of Defense of Russia has disappeared somewhere… I wonder if he personally wanted to visit Chornobaivka? I am grateful to our defenders who showed the occupiers that the sea will not be calm for them even when there is no storm. Because there will be fire. As on those Russian ships that departed this week on the famous route from the port of Berdyansk. I want to warn all traitors of Ukraine who sided with the enemy in Crimea years ago. You switched sides because you thought you would live better, right? Not because you want to repeat the tragic fate of your colleagues who died on those ships or somewhere else on land or at sea in Ukraine. Well, live. Stay as far away from our cities and our army as possible. The number of Russian casualties in this war has already exceeded 16,000 killed. Among them are senior commanders. There have not been reports about killed Russian colonels-general or admirals yet. But the commander of one of the occupying armies and deputy commander of the Black Sea Fleet are already there. The Armed Forces continue to repel enemy attacks in the south of the country, in Donbas, in the Kharkiv direction and in the Kyiv region. By restraining Russia's actions, our defenders are leading the Russian leadership to a simple and logical idea: talk is necessary. Meaningful. Urgent. Fair. For the sake of the result, not for the sake of the delay. 16,000 Russian servicemen have already died. For what? What does it give and to whom? The conversation must be meaningful. Ukrainian sovereignty must be guaranteed. Ukraine's territorial integrity must be ensured. That is, the conditions must be fair. And the Ukrainian people will not accept others. During the week we managed to establish 18 humanitarian corridors. A total of 37,606 people were rescued from the blocked cities. In particular, 26,477 Mariupol residents were evacuated from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia via the humanitarian corridor. The situation in the city remains absolutely tragic. The Russian military does not allow any humanitarian aid into the city. They only use Mariupol residents in fakes for their propagandists. Pretending to start giving something to people. I will continue to inform the nations of other countries in great detail about such disgusting cynicism of the occupiers, about all the war crimes of Russia against the civilians of our heroic Mariupol and other cities of Ukraine. It is very important. I want to emphasize: not only politicians and government officials, but nations. Everyone on the planet needs to know what Russia is doing. So that the responsibility for crimes against the Ukrainian people becomes inevitable and as severe as possible for the Russian military. During the week alone, I addressed the parliaments of Italy, Japan, France and Sweden. I spoke at the summits of NATO, the G7 and the leaders of the European Union. Each of these speeches attracted maximum attention in the respective countries and in the world as a whole. The reviews show that the Ukrainian position was heard. And this is my main goal in such speeches. You know perfectly well what a powerful system of state propaganda Russia has built. They have spent and are spending tens of billions of dollars on it. Probably no one in the world has ever spent such crazy money on lies. But they did not take into account one thing. Where the path of lies needs to be paved with money and the result is not guaranteed, the path of truth is difficult, but the path of truth paves itself. The main thing is to be honest. Next week I will continue this important work for our interests. Interests of Ukraine. Interests of freedom and independence. I had a conversation today with Turkish President Erdoğan. The results of the NATO summit were discussed. Of course, we also talked about the efforts that could bring peace closer to Ukraine and end this senseless Russian invasion of a foreign land. There is important news from our government officials. First. They have already started paying pensions for April. In particular, the Pension Fund has transferred to Oschadbank the entire amount of pensions for the Chernihiv and Luhansk regions. Tomorrow people will have money on their bank cards and Ukrposhta will deliver cash. Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, the payment of April pensions will continue in other regions of Eastern and Central Ukraine. The other day a wave of payments will cover the entire state. This is one of our priorities: the Ukrainian state has fulfilled and will fulfill all obligations to our citizens, to our pensioners. Second. Under the eSupport program, more than 20 billion hryvnias have already been paid to people who have lost their jobs or the opportunity to have business. The amount of payment is 6,500 hryvnias. Third. Officials are preparing a new support program for our IDPs from the war zones. Regional administrations have been given a clear task to quickly allocate land for the construction of temporary housing for displaced persons. I want to emphasize once again - this is temporary housing. Once we establish peace, we will begin the immediate, large-scale reconstruction of our state. But now people need a temporary home. Their home. And it is better to have a home in Ukraine than somewhere abroad. We pay aid, we give a job. Native people. Native country. All the details of this support program will be presented by Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. And a few more words about the path of truth. About those who bring you and us true information about everything that is happening in our country. I would like to express special gratitude to our journalists today. To all those who ensure the work of the national telethon ""United News"", to all our media people. Correspondents, presenters, editors, media managers, cameramen, directors, video editors, make-up artists, producers - everyone without whom it is impossible to imagine television. Everyone who united and together with other defenders of our people provides Ukrainians with truthful information and, last but not least, confidence 24/7. I am grateful to all of you! And, I'm sure, I can say this on behalf of all Ukrainians. Glory to you all! Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"
"112 Ukrainian orphans and children with disabilities left for Innsbruck, Austria",2022-03-25T14:45:00Z,"112 Ukrainian children with families, orphans and children with disabilities left for the Austrian city of Innsbruck. This is the second group of young Ukrainians sent to Austria under the agreement between governor of Tyrol Günther Platter, the Embassy of Ukraine in the Republic of Austria and the First Lady Olena Zelenska. This group included children from Luhansk, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Volyn, Lviv regions and the city of Kyiv. These are children with different destinies, they are taken care of either by their families or by the state. The group includes pupils of special institutions - training and rehabilitation centers, special and sanatorium schools, as well as children from ordinary schools who are brought up in families, children with disabilities. Olena Zelenska said that thanks to the joint efforts of the Embassy of Ukraine in the Republic of Austria and the government of Tyrol an agreement was reached to host at least 300 young Ukrainians, including children with disabilities, their parents and caregivers. The first 130 children have recently arrived in Austria. ""So, several hundred more lives will be safe. We continue to work to ensure the safety of all Ukrainians,"" said the First Lady. The project is implemented under the patronage of the wife of the President of Ukraine with the support of the governor of Tyrol, the Embassy of Ukraine in Austria, the Ministry of Education and Science and the Lviv Regional State Administration."
President presented state awards to the employees of the Security Service of Ukraine who proved themselves in repelling Russian aggression,2022-03-25T14:17:00Z,"On the 30th anniversary of the Security Service of Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy presented state awards to the employees of the Security Service of Ukraine for courage, dedication and exemplary performance of official duties in defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our state. ""We feel your protection of the Ukrainian state. I know that many officers and employees are now on the frontline, performing important operations. But wherever you are, we are all defending the most important thing we have - our country,"" he said. The Head of State thanked the employees of the Security Service of Ukraine for their faithful service to Ukraine."
"If Russia had known what it would face in Ukraine, it would have definitely been afraid to come here - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-03-25T01:11:00Z,"Free people of our free country! It's already night, but we're working. The country must move towards peace, move forward. With each day of our defense, we are bringing the peace we need so much closer. We are bringing victory closer. Because in this war it is simply impossible for us not to win. And it will be so. And we can't stop even for a minute. Because every minute is about our destiny, about our future. About whether we live or not. The 30th day. It's been a month! If Russia had known it would face that, I'm sure they would have definitely been afraid to come here. During this month, we’ve withstood all the main directions of Russian strikes. The world has applied destructive sanctions. And we are reaching an agreement on new ones. Today I have delivered some important speeches. To the participants of the NATO summit, the G7 summit, to the summit of the leaders of the European Union. To the Swedish Parliament. All this is for the sake of support for our state. We need it for our protection. I spoke with the President of Lithuania, Mr. Nausėda, Prime Minister of Israel Bennett and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Johnson. All this is for Russia to understand one thing: it is necessary to seek peace. Russia also needs to seek peace. I informed the President of Egypt about the current situation. And today I signed some very important decrees. On awarding the title of Hero of Ukraine to seven servicemen of the National Guard, to five of them, unfortunately, posthumously. Also on state awards to 240 servicemen of the National Guard of Ukraine and 119 servicemen of the Armed Forces. On state awards to 14 heads of local communities, local authorities. On state awards to 31 medical workers. And on awarding the honorary title ""The Hero City of Ukraine"" to four more cities: Bucha, Irpin, Okhtyrka, Mykolaiv. You know, after signing these decrees, I felt that it would really be worthwhile to award and confer the title of hero to millions and millions of our people. To you, to all Ukrainians who are doing everything they can for the sake of victory. For peace. In a place where they are. And I am grateful to each and every one of you. To each and everyone for this month of great struggle. And, of course, to our Armed Forces, of course, the National Guard, our border guards, doctors, rescuers, territorial defense, reconnaissance officers, special services and many, many people, representatives of other professions who save our lives. Who protects our free Ukraine. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to all our people! Glory to us all! Glory to Ukraine!"
Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy at a meeting of the European Council,2022-03-25T01:03:00Z,"Greetings to all of you, greetings to all our friends, friends of Ukraine! Greetings to all who support freedom! Mr. President of the European Council, my friend Charles, I congratulate you and congratulate all of us on your re-election. I think this is very important and this is right. I am grateful for the opportunity to address you and the nations of Europe. Today it's already been a month since the Russian invasion. After 8 years of aggression in Donbas. The month of the great war. In short, about its chronicle. Because everything is in my head and everything is fragments. Unfortunately, tragic ones. It all started on February 24. From Russia. When the missiles flew. Early in the morning. Against our peaceful cities. People have still been sleeping. Death has already come. Russia sent armored vehicles against us. Brought several thousand tanks to Ukraine. It’s hard to count how many of them have already been burned. How many can still kill us. Bombs fell on our people. From planes that took off from Belarus. And they didn't even admit that they did it. Russia captured the Chornobyl NPP. Staff have not been released for 24 days there. Imagine, people lived 24 days at such a facility, worked at such a facility. These are our people. So that nothing terrible happens in Chornobyl again. To prevent the catastrophe. And the Russian military held them hostage. Russian tanks fired at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Russia fired missiles at Babyn Yar. It has already destroyed more than 230 schools and 155 kindergartens. Killed 128 children. Fired missiles at universities. Burns residential neighborhoods with rocket artillery. Whole cities, villages. Just to ashes. Nothing remains. The Russian military killed journalists. Although they saw the inscription ""Press"" on them. They may not have been taught to read. Only to kill. Russia has blocked Mariupol. This is a blockade that no one could have imagined in our time. Hundreds of thousands of people without water, without food. Under constant shelling, under constant bombing. The Russian militaries deliberately blow up hospitals, maternity hospitals, shelters. They even blow up shelters, imagine! Knowing for sure that people are hiding there. They killed 96-year-old Borys Romanchenko in Kharkiv. A Russian projectile flew into his apartment. Into the apartment of a man who survived the Nazi concentration camps, but could not survive Russia that went to our Ukrainian Kharkiv. Thank God, our military stopped Russia there. Russian troops are using phosphorus bombs - it was this morning. Rape women. Loot houses. Destroy churches! All churches. Even those of the Moscow Patriarchate. Abducted more than 2,000 children from Ukraine. We don't know where our children are, where our 2,000 children are. Fire at humanitarian convoys. They don't care who's there. Children, women, church representatives who accompany the humanitarian cargo. They kill people in Donetsk and say it's us. They say it's us, the ""nationalists"". Russia is doing all this. For a month already. On our land. And Ukraine? What is Ukraine doing? It did not go to a foreign land. Never dreamed of any war. Shoots down missiles. Urges strangers to lay down their arms and return home. For the sake of life. Do you understand? For the sake of life. Not death. Heals and feeds war prisoners. Allows them to contact their relatives by phone. Collects the corpses of Russian soldiers from the fields, which they simply leave, abandon. Hundreds and hundreds. Ukraine has united for peace. And for the sake of peace it unites the world. Tries to unblock the besieged cities. Maintains the safe operation of nuclear power plants. Even in the presence of the occupiers. Calls on the IAEA to intervene and patiently explains to the international bureaucracy what is happening. Evacuates people from dangerous areas. Does not stop trying to deliver humanitarian aid. Records Russian war crimes. Gathers evidence. Invites journalists. Maintains the functioning of all institutions of a normal state. Defends its own country! And every morning... Do you hear me? Every morning, the whole state, the whole of Ukraine - children, grandparents - everyone honors the memory of all those who died for our state with a moment of silence. Have you heard anything like this on Russian television? Have you seen this in their schools? They are even ashamed of the word ""war"". They call it a ""special operation"". Although they organized a massacre here, as the Nazis did. These are different worlds. We and they. These are different values. This is a different attitude to life. The Russian military does not see what dignity is. They do not know what conscience is. They do not understand why we value our freedom so much. This is what determines how the country will live. And who should be in Europe. And what about the European Union? I want to thank you - you are united, united around us. But I want to say that it was done in one way or another. But once again, the main thing is that you have united. And we really appreciate that. You have applied sanctions. We are grateful. These are powerful steps. But it was a little late. Because if it had been preventive, Russia would not have gone to war. At least no one knows for sure. There was a chance. You blocked Nord Stream 2. We are grateful to you. And rightly so. But it was also a little late. Because if it had been in time, Russia would not have created a gas crisis. At least there was a chance. And now you and I are preparing Ukraine's membership in the European Union. Finally. Here I ask you - do not be late. Please. Because during this month you have compared these worlds, and you see everything. You saw who is worth what. And you saw that Ukraine should be in the EU in the near future. At least you have everything for that. And we have this chance. Lithuania stands for us. Latvia stands for us. Estonia stands for us. Poland stands for us. France - Emanuel, I really believe that you will stand for us. Slovenia stands for us. Slovakia stands for us. The Czech Republic stands for us. Romania knows what dignity is, so it will stand for us at the crucial moment. Bulgaria stands for us. Greece, I believe, stands with us. Germany... A little later. Portugal - well, almost… Croatia stands for us. Sweden - yellow and blue should always stand together. Finland - I know you are with us. The Netherlands stands for the rational, so we’ll find common ground. Malta - I believe we will succeed. Denmark - I believe we will succeed. Luxembourg - we understand each other. Cyprus - I really believe you are with us. Italy - thank you for your support! Spain - we’ll find common ground. Belgium - we will find arguments. Austria, together with Ukrainians, it is an opportunity for you. I'm sure of it. Ireland - well, almost. Hungary... I want to stop here and be honest. Once and for all. You have to decide for yourself who you are with. You are a sovereign state. I’ve been to Budapest. I adore your city. I have been many times - very beautiful, very hospitable city. And people, too. You have had tragic moments in your life. I visited your waterfront. I saw this memorial… Shoes on the Danube Bank. About mass killings. I was there with my family. Listen, Viktor, do you know what's going on in Mariupol? Please, if you can, go to your waterfront. Look at those shoes. And you will see how mass killings can happen again in today's world. And that's what Russia is doing today. The same shoes. In Mariupol, there are the same people. Adults and children. Grandparents. And there are thousands of them. And these thousands are gone. And you hesitate whether to impose sanctions or not? And you hesitate whether to let weapons through or not? And you hesitate whether to trade with Russia or not?  There is no time to hesitate. It's time to decide already. We believe in you. We need your support. We believe in your people. We believe in the European Union. And we believe that Germany will also be with us at the crucial moment. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!"
"President of Ukraine met with the Speakers of the Parliaments of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia who arrived in Kyiv",2022-03-24T20:34:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Speaker of the Saeima of the Republic of Latvia Ināra Mūrniece, Speaker of the Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania Viktorija Čmilytė-Nielsen and President of the Riigikogu of the Republic of Estonia Jüri Ratas who arrived in Kyiv. The Ukrainian President noted the importance of their visit to Ukraine despite the difficult security situation caused by the Russian invasion. ""From the first hours you are with us - at the level of leaders, at the level of nations. That is why we are grateful to you. In Ukraine, everyone understands this, everyone appreciates it,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. ""The highest trust of the people of Ukraine is in your countries and in Poland, it is true. This corresponds to the steps you have taken towards Ukraine,"" he added. The President praised the signing today in Kyiv of a joint statement by the Speakers of the Parliaments of Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in support of our state. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also expressed gratitude for signing a joint statement ""On the Urgent Need to Modernize the Air Defense of Ukraine"", which was signed by representatives of the parliaments of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. ""We welcome all the legislative initiatives in support of Ukraine that you are talking about and fulfilling in your parliaments, as well as in the international arena. You were also among the first to help with weapons,"" he said. The President briefed the Speakers of the Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian Parliaments on the consequences of a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, noting that Russian troops were deliberately attacking the civilian population and destroying peaceful infrastructure. The aggressor is trying to besiege large cities such as Mariupol, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, creating a humanitarian catastrophe in many settlements. According to the President, in order to effectively protect citizens, including civilians, Ukraine needs weapons - air defense, aircraft and armored vehicles. Military and financial assistance from the Baltic States and other partner countries is vital for Ukraine today, said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He also stressed the importance of further strengthening sanctions against Russia, including the imposition of a full embargo on any trade with Russia and Belarus, as well as the disconnection of all Russian banks from the SWIFT system. This will deprive the Russian military machine of funding and force Moscow to seek peace. The President thanked Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia for their active support of our country's accelerated movement towards membership in the European Union. He noted that given Ukraine's defense of European values in the war with Russia, our country deserves an accelerated procedure for joining the EU."
Address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the participants of the Group of Seven summit,2022-03-24T17:21:00Z,"Ladies and Gentlemen! The world's greatest democracies represented by you! First of all, I would like to thank Chancellor Scholz and the German presidency for the opportunity to address you today. At this urgent summit. Today is exactly one month since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation. Russia, which was present at this format together with advanced democracies. Then the G7 was the G8. And there were a lot of hopes for its participation, for a dialogue with Russia. I want to emphasize that most of those hopes, as well as the place next to the Group of Seven, Russia received in advance. And it still hasn't deserved this advance. But this and other similar advances gave the Russian leadership the impression that they would get away with anything. In recent years, the Russian state has created so many crises and such instability that it has now become a major problem for the world. A problem that is only growing. And you and I still have no idea how many more such urgent summits will have to be held before the problems created by Russia are resolved. Europe is going through a war, every day of which is full of war crimes of Russian troops. This morning I received information that Russian troops had used phosphorus bombs against civilians in Ukraine. The threat of large-scale use of chemical weapons by Russia on the territory of Ukraine is quite real. We are trying to find out the exact number of deported Ukrainians. People who are forcibly deported to Russia on a daily basis are deprived of documents, means of communication - everything is taken away - and distributed among their regions. And even then Russia tries to mobilize them into its army! It illegally abducts children. According to our data, more than two thousand already! Ukrainian cities - Mariupol, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Okhtyrka and other cities - look like a global catastrophe. They are ruined. The roads from these cities, which people used to escape, resemble the set of a post-apocalyptic movie with hundreds of burned and shot cars. But it is true: there is a global catastrophe! Russia has destroyed the global security architecture and dealt a powerful blow to international relations. But this is just the beginning. This war may be followed by a global food crisis. The longer there is no peace on Ukrainian land, the less food the world market will receive from Ukraine. Consequently, many countries in Asia, Africa, and even Europe, may have extraordinary problems with access to basic products, with food prices. This will definitely result in political destabilization. Maybe this is also the goal of the Russian leadership? I do not know. We must all act immediately! Immediately stop Russian troops, remove them from the territory of Ukraine. Peace is needed immediately before the world faces an even greater level of problems. It is better now to tighten sanctions against Russia as much as necessary to stop its military machine than to deal with the consequences of the food and political security global crisis. Unprecedented challenges! If so, a full embargo on trade with Russia is needed. It is necessary to deprive Russia of the opportunity to use GPS in war. It is very important. So that this system does not help Russian missiles and bombs destroy peaceful cities. Russian banks and, most importantly, the Central Bank of Russia must get a complete blockade from the global financial system. War criminals should be left without money at all! And their frozen assets should turn, inter alia, into reparations for the reconstruction of Ukraine. It is better to give Ukraine the kind of weaponry support we really need now than to look for weapons for other countries later. We mean Georgia, Moldova, the Baltic States, Poland and Central Asia. The sooner this happens as we ask, the sooner there will be peace in Eastern Europe. This is in our best interest. This is in your best interest. This is in the interests of all democracies. Because democracies must be able to defend themselves. Freedom must be armed. Life must overcome death. And I emphasize this: no advances to such a Russian state! Never again. Any steps towards it or towards any other violator of international law should take place only after their steps towards peace, towards universally recognized rules. And on the basis of a system of preventive deterrence. I am grateful to you for the unprecedented unity. For your resolute support for peace for our country, for our people. I am grateful to those of you who are trying one hundred percent to stop this war. I believe we can do it. We will be able to make your Group of Seven not just the Great Seven, but the Great Seven of Peacekeepers. What do we need for this? Ukraine is very specific in answering this question. First - to intensify sanctions against Russian aggression on a weekly basis until it stops and restores peace for us. Second - to take part in the creation of a new system of security guarantees for Ukraine, for our region. Real guarantees. Effective. Those that can stop any aggressor in 24 hours. We offered to create an association - U-24. This is what the world really needs. Not just to preventively stop the war or hostilities that have already begun. But also to provide assistance to the states that were affected by the natural disaster, that need to be supported during a pandemic, that are facing migration or food crises. The world needs new effective alliances! New effective guarantees! This can support developing democracies. This can support the economies of countries where there are no stable institutions yet. And third - which directly concerns our state and Eastern Europe. We must rebuild our state together as soon as possible after the war. Rebuild cities. Restore economic life. Bring people back. I offer you to participate in such a project. Recovery project. I am sure it will be in our common interest. But first - weapons for Ukraine. First - increase sanctions against Russia every week. That is, peace comes first. We have the strength to do it. You have the strength to do it. So, may there be peace! I am grateful to everyone who supports us. Thank you. Glory to Ukraine!"
"Israel could become one of the guarantors of the international agreement on security guarantees for Ukraine, as it should understand us like no other - Andriy Yermak",2022-03-24T15:42:00Z,"Ukraine would like the State of Israel to be one of the guarantors of a major international treaty that would provide clear security guarantees for our country after the end of the war with Russia. Ukraine also hopes for an effective mediation role of Israel in ending the war and more powerful assistance to our country. This was stated by Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak during a conversation with the Israeli media. He stressed that our country has very warm, friendly and special relations with Israel. Andriy Yermak noted that the Ukrainian authorities welcome the mediating role of the State of Israel in its attempts to stop the war started by the Russian Federation on the territory of our country. ""We are amazed at how deeply Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, are aware of the issue. And we believe that he is really determined to do everything necessary to bring peace to our land and end the war,"" said the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine. At the same time, he stated that there are issues that Ukraine will never compromise on. ""These are compromises related to our independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty. And Prime Minister Bennett knows about it,"" Andriy Yermak added. According to him, there are also hopes that Israel can be one of the guarantors of the future major international agreement on security guarantees for Ukraine. ""Such an agreement provides for a large list of countries - potential guarantors. Therefore, we are holding separate consultations with each of these countries in order to meet together afterwards,"" said the Head of the Office of the President. In addition, Ukraine would like to receive more assistance from the State of Israel in armaments and military technology. Andriy Yermak noted that the Israeli authorities should also resolve the issue, which was very negatively perceived in Ukraine, when the rules of entry for our citizens were changed and electronic permits were introduced."
Speech by the President of Ukraine at the Riksdag in Sweden,2022-03-24T14:18:00Z,"Greetings, Mr. Speaker! It is a great honor and opportunity to address you today. Greetings also to the Prime Minister! To the Swedish Riksdag MPs and members of the Government! Swedish people! Now the blue and yellow flag in the world is probably the most popular. These colors are associated with freedom. This is true for different people on different continents. And of course in Europe. The blue and yellow colors of the national flag are not just about Ukraine. This is about you as well, about Sweden. And obviously this is not a coincidence. This is fate. Because we are equally for freedom. We are equally for a peaceful life. We are equally for respect for everyone. We are equally for justice and equally for caring for the natural world in which we live. Therefore, it is logical that Sweden is now among those who support Ukraine the most. And I am sincerely grateful to each of you for this. Today is exactly the month of the worst ordeal - the full-scale war waged by Russia against our state. Europe has never known such a dark month since World War II. It has not seen such destruction and such war crimes. The list of those killed already reaches thousands. Dozens of our cities and communities were destroyed. Russian troops do not distinguish between civilian and military targets. They destroy everything. They burn residential neighborhoods and houses. They blow up hospitals. They even fire at kindergartens with rocket artillery! Hundreds of educational facilities and more than 200 schools were destroyed. Russian troops bombed universities. Imagine - they destroy any infrastructure that simply serves life. Warehouses with food and medicine. They seized two nuclear power plants. Yesterday they hit the second chemical production already. Phosphorus bombs were used today! Both adults and children were killed. What is the purpose of such actions of Russia? What is the reason of such terror against us? This is an attempt to conquer the whole nation. An attempt to make the neighboring state a slave. Ladies and Gentlemen! Swedish people! Modern Europe, which has finally become peaceful, is built on clear principles. Namely: there can be no forced border revision. And every nation has the right to choose its own future - without dictatorship, without coercion, without occupation. Thanks to these two principles, we in Europe have had an unprecedented era of cooperation. Peace. Confidence. We had it until the Russian leadership decided that it could travel in time. That it allegedly could cancel the 21st century. Allegedly could act as in the old days of totalitarian ideologies. If Ukraine failed to endure, defend itself, it would mean that everything we, living and modern people, value was lost. Everything you value. Everything that is valued by any free people of any state. This would mean that all of Russia's neighbors are in danger. This would mean that you are in danger, because only the sea separates you from this aggressive policy of this state. And Russian propagandists are already discussing on state television how Russia is occupying your Gotland island in particular. And how to keep it under control for decades. They show it to the Russians on the map, show the directions of the offensive... You may ask for what purpose? They say it will be beneficial for Russia to deploy air defense systems and a military base in Gotland. To cover the capture of the Baltic states. Russia went to war against Ukraine because it expects to go further to Europe. Expects to destroy freedom further in Europe. This is a fundamental challenge for the European security system. Please take a look at what the Russian military has already done in our country. 8 years of war in the east. Occupation of Crimea. This is repression. Torture of people, suppression of all manifestations of freedom and diversity. A month of full-scale war. Total cruelty. The bombing of peaceful cities is as terrible as it was in Syria. Abduction of children. Forced transportation of children and adults to Russia. Rape in the occupied areas. Large-scale looting by the Russian military. Now tens of thousands of houses and tens of thousands of apartments have been destroyed. And there are already almost ten million migrants, three and a half million of them in the European Union. I deliberately do not want to call these Ukrainians refugees. Because I know that they will return to Ukraine. As soon as Russia leaves our land, as soon as peace is established. Ladies and Gentlemen! Swedish people! Sweden was one of the first to come to our aid. I am grateful to you! Your support is absolutely sincere. It is based on values. On our love for freedom. On what our blue-yellow national colors symbolize. The whole world knows what Sweden wants. The whole world has seen in a month of this shameful war what Ukraine wants. We are together in our anti-war coalition. And we must do everything to make Russia seek peace. Sweden has made a historic decision to provide Ukraine with the necessary weapons. We thank you for that! For your prudence. For your foresight. Sweden supports the sanctions policy. A policy without which there will be no peace. Because the Russian leadership will not understand any language other than effective sanctions. But for peace to come faster, sanctions packages against Russia must be applied on a weekly basis. Not a single barrel of Russian oil! No Russian ships at your ports! Not a single euro of taxes of your companies in Russia! Their military machine must be left without means of subsistence. Deliberate actions of Russian troops to destroy civilians in Ukraine, to destroy our peaceful cities must receive an inevitable and principled response from all European countries. From the free world. This has already become the typical feature of Russian troops... Syria, Ukraine... Massacres. Cities destroyed to the ground. Phosphorus and other prohibited munitions. To prevent this from becoming a victorious strategy, all war crimes must be punished. Those who gave the order to kill and those who killed must face the Tribunal. So that no other country in the world thinks that it can kill people with impunity just like that, that it can destroy neighboring countries. I am confident that together we will be able to ensure peace, and that is why we must now think about rebuilding Ukraine after this war. And it will happen! I invite Swedish architects, Swedish companies, the Swedish state, your people to take part in this historic project. Ukraine was beautiful. But now it will be great, because this is our nation. Great Ukraine. Great recovery project. For the sake of the people. For the development of our country and the whole of Europe. I invite you to show to the world, to all present and future generations that war does not bring the result. And peace does. And it gives life. Sweden is the first country we offer this project to. You can take patronage over any city, region or industry to restore them. I am confident that your leadership will be indispensable. Your technology, business and your love of life. Your ability to organize space in people's best interest. Ukraine - all our heroic defenders, all our citizens - has already done a lot to protect our common European values, our common European home. We are fighting not only for Ukraine, but also for the security of the European Union! And we have proved that we deserve to be a full member of the European Union. The decision is already being elaborated. It's time to adopt it! I believe that you will support us in this as well. Thank you, thank you Sweden! Glory to Ukraine!"
"NATO can still prevent the deaths of Ukrainians from Russian strikes by providing weapons - Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-03-24T13:21:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on NATO to provide our country with military assistance to the extent that will enable the Ukrainian army to oppose the military arsenal of the Russian Federation. “Ukraine does not have powerful anti-missile weapons, and has a much smaller aircraft fleet than Russia. Therefore, their advantage in the sky is like the use of weapons of mass destruction. And you see the consequences today - how many people were killed, how many peaceful cities were destroyed,” the Head of State noted during the speech in the video conference format at the NATO summit in Brussels. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that the Ukrainian army has been resisting the Russian invasion for a month in unequal conditions. Russia's superiority has resulted in numerous casualties, including among the civilian population of Ukraine. “To save people and our cities, Ukraine needs military assistance - without restrictions. As Russia uses without restrictions its entire arsenal against us. Destroys all living things. Any objects - from houses to churches, from food warehouses to universities, from bridges to hospitals,” the President said. He reminded that Ukraine had asked NATO to close the skies for Russian military aircraft or to provide aircraft. “You have thousands of fighter jets! But we haven't been given any yet. We asked for tanks. So that we can unblock our cities that are now dying - Mariupol, Berdyansk, Melitopol, others. Cities where Russia is keeping hundreds of thousands of people hostage and artificially creating famine - no water, no food, nothing there. You have at least 20,000 tanks! Ukraine asked for a percent, one percent of all your tanks to be given or sold to us! But we do not have a clear answer yet. The worst thing during the war is not having clear answers to requests for help,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. The Head of State stressed that Ukraine had never wanted this war and did not want to fight for years. ""We just want to save our people. We want to survive,"" he added. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed: the North Atlantic Alliance can still prevent the deaths of Ukrainians from Russian strikes by providing weapons needed by the Ukrainian army. At the same time, the President thanked those NATO member states that help Ukraine as much as they can. But now is the time to take care of security in Europe. “I am sure you already understand that Russia does not intend to stop in Ukraine. Does not intend and will not. It wants to go further. Against the eastern members of NATO. The Baltic states, Poland - that's for sure,” he said. The President called on the Alliance to provide Ukraine with one percent of all their aircraft and tanks, as well as MLRS systems, anti-ship weapons, air defense equipment. ""When all this is finally available, it will give us, and you as well, one hundred percent security,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He also made a request to NATO regarding the Ukrainian military: ""After such a war against Russia, I ask you: Never, please, never tell us again that our army does not meet NATO standards. We have shown what our standards are capable of. And how much we can give to the common security in Europe and the world. How much we can do to protect from aggression against everything we value, everything you value,” the President stressed. At the same time, the President added that NATO had yet to show what the Alliance can do to save people, “to show that this is truly the most powerful defense union in the world.”"
Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the NATO Summit,2022-03-24T12:49:00Z,"Dear attendees! I am addressing you from Kyiv, our capital, which has been fighting for a month already, just as our entire state. Yes, it is true - we are not in the Alliance. Not in the most powerful defense union in the world. Not one of the 30 states under the umbrella of joint protection. Under the umbrella of Article 5. It feels like we are in the ""gray zone"". Between the West and Russia. But we defend all our common values. And we are bright people! And we have been defending all these values for a month now! A month of heroic resistance. A month of the darkest suffering. A month of unpunished destruction of the peaceful state, and with it - the whole architecture of global security. All this is before the eyes of the whole world. Over the decades, Russia has accumulated considerable resources, military resources, manpower and equipment, air bombs, missiles. They invested crazy money in death while the world invested in life. But Ukraine is holding on bravely! At the cost of thousands of lives. At the cost of destroyed cities. At the cost of almost ten million migrants. Three and a half of them are already in your territories, in the territories of NATO countries. I am grateful for the support of these people. And people, unfortunately, continue to leave their homes. They are fleeing the terror that the occupiers brought with them. The very first hours of the invasion meant brutal missile strikes for us. During the month of the war, Russia fired more than a thousand different missiles at our cities. Made hundreds of air raids. On February 24, I addressed you with a perfectly clear, logical request to help close our skies. In any format. Protect our people from Russian bombs and missiles. We did not hear a clear answer. Ukraine does not have powerful anti-missile weapons, and has a much smaller aircraft fleet than Russia. Therefore, their advantage in the sky is like the use of weapons of mass destruction. And you see the consequences today - how many people were killed, how many peaceful cities were destroyed. The Ukrainian army has been resisting for a month in unequal conditions! And I have been repeating the same thing for a month now. To save people and our cities, Ukraine needs military assistance - without restrictions. As Russia uses without restrictions its entire arsenal against us. Destroys all living things. Any objects - from houses to churches, from food warehouses to universities, from bridges to hospitals. Ukraine asked for your planes. So that we do not lose so many people. And you have thousands of fighter jets! But we haven't been given any yet. We asked for tanks. So that we can unblock our cities that are now dying - Mariupol, Berdyansk, Melitopol, others. Cities where Russia is keeping hundreds of thousands of people hostage and artificially creating famine - no water, no food, nothing there. You have at least 20,000 tanks! Ukraine asked for a percent, one percent of all your tanks to be given or sold to us! But we do not have a clear answer yet... The worst thing during the war is not having clear answers to requests for help. Ukraine never wanted this war. And does not want to fight for years. We just want to save our people. We want to survive! Just survive! Like any nation, we have the right to it. The right to life. The right to this one percent. And I do not blame NATO - I want to be clear. You are not guilty. It's not your missiles, it's not your bombs that are destroying our cities. This morning, by the way, there were phosphorus bombs. Phosphorus Russian bombs. Adults were killed again and children were killed again. I just want you to know that the Alliance can still prevent the deaths of Ukrainians from Russian strikes, from Russian occupation, by providing us with all the weapons we need. Yes, we are not in the Alliance. And I do not make these claims. But Ukrainians never thought that the Alliance and the Allies were different. That in matters of life and death you can be a force separately, but together - no. That NATO may be afraid of Russia's actions. I am sure you already understand that Russia does not intend to stop in Ukraine. Does not intend and will not. It wants to go further. Against the eastern members of NATO. The Baltic states, Poland - that's for sure. Will NATO then stop thinking about it, worrying about how Russia will react? Who can be sure of that? And do you have confidence that Article 5 can work? ""Budapest"" hasn't worked for us already. Our Budapest Memorandum. Has not worked for peace in Ukraine. And I will tell you honestly - today Budapest is not working for peace in Ukraine as well. Yes, we receive help from individual members of the Alliance. I am very grateful. Ukrainians are sincerely grateful for this. To each of you who gives what you have, supporting us. But what about the Alliance? The question of Article 5 is fundamental. I just want you to know what we think about it. And I sincerely wish you that we are wrong in our assessments and in our doubts. I sincerely wish that you actually have a very strong Alliance. Because if we are wrong, the world is safe. But if we are at least one percent right, I ask you to reconsider your attitude. Your own estimates. And really take care of security, security in Europe and, consequently, in the world. You can give us one percent of all your aircraft. One percent of all your tanks. One percent! We can't just buy it. Such a supply directly depends only on NATO's decisions, on political decisions, by the way. MLRS systems. Anti-ship weapons. Means of air defense. Is it possible to survive such a war without it? So when it's finally available, it will give us and you as well, one hundred percent security. And we need one. And the only thing I demand from you… After such a month of war. This is a request for the sake of our military. After such a war against Russia ... Never, please, never tell us again that our army does not meet NATO standards. We have shown what our standards are capable of. And how much we can give to the common security in Europe and the world. How much we can do to protect against aggression against everything we value, everything you value. But NATO has yet to show what the Alliance can do to save people. To show that this is truly the most powerful defense union in the world. And the world is waiting. And Ukraine is very much waiting. Waiting for real actions. Real security guarantees. From those whose word is trustworthy. And whose actions can keep the peace. Truly. All offers are on the table. Our needs are on the table. We need peace immediately. The answers are up to you. I am thankful to those who help us! Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!"
Address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Ukrainians and the nations of the world,2022-03-24T00:18:00Z,"Free people of the free world! Ukrainians and citizens of all countries who value freedom! Friends! On March 24 it will be the month of our resistance. Heroic resistance of the Ukrainian state, the Ukrainian people to the ruthless invasion of Russia. It's already a month of our defense against the attempt to destroy us. Wipe off the face of the earth. The original plan of the Russian troops failed already in the first days of the invasion. They thought Ukrainians would be frightened. They thought Ukrainians would not fight. They were wrong. They know nothing about us, about Ukrainians. They know nothing at all about freedom. About how valuable it is. They do not know how freedom enriches life. Gives meaning to life. But there are many of them! There are still many invaders. Russia is getting manpower from everywhere. Equipment. Air bombs, missiles. Looking for mercenaries around the world. Any scum capable of shooting at civilians. Russian troops destroy our cities. Kill civilians indiscriminately. Rape women. Abduct children. Shoot at refugees. Capture humanitarian convoys. They are engaged in looting. They burn museums, blow up schools and hospitals. The target for them is universities, residential neighborhoods... Anything! Russian troops do not know the limits of evil. But... The war of Russia is not only the war against Ukraine. Its meaning is much wider.  Russia started the war against freedom as it is.  This is only the beginning for Russia on the Ukrainian land. Russia is trying to defeat the freedom of all people in Europe. Of all the people in the world. It tries to show that only crude and cruel force matters.  It tries to show that people do not matter, as well as everything else that makes us people.  That's the reason we all must stop Russia. The world must stop the war.  I thank everyone who acts in support of Ukraine. In support of freedom. But the war continues. The acts of terror against peaceful people go on. One month already! That long! It breaks my heart, hearts of all Ukrainians and every free person on the planet.  That’s why I ask you to stand against the war! Starting from March 24 – exactly one month after the Russian invasion… From this day and after then.  Show your standing! Come from your offices, your homes, your schools and universities. Come in the name of peace. Come with Ukrainian symbols to support Ukraine, to support freedom, to support life.  Come to your squares, your streets. Make yourselves visible and heard. Say that people matter. Freedom matters. Peace matters. Ukraine matters.  From March 24.  In downtowns of your cities. All as one together who want to stop the war. I want to address the citizens of Russia separately. I am sure that there are many of you who are disgusted by the policy of your state. Who are already just sick of what you see on TV. Of the lies of your propagandists on the Internet. Propagandists who are paid by your taxes. And they lie about the war, which is paid for by your taxes. And which makes all the citizens of Russia poorer. Poorer every day. Isn't that stupid? Your state collects taxes from you to make you poorer. To isolate you from the world. To make it easier for them to control you. And easier to send you to the war to die. Ukraine has never threatened the security of Russia. Even now, we are doing everything just to bring peace back to our land. Not to yours - to our land. To our people. We are doing everything to end this war. And when we succeed - it will certainly happen - you will be sure of at least one thing: your children will no longer be sent to die on our land, on our territory. Therefore, you, the citizens of Russia, are also interested in peace. Save your sons from the war. Tell the truth about the war. And if you can leave Russia so as not to give your taxes to the war, do it. All polls show that the people of Europe and America support us. I am grateful to all of you for that. Grateful on behalf of Ukraine. To everyone in the European Union, the United States, Canada, Britain and other countries for supporting us. For supporting freedom. For supporting Ukraine. On March 24, three important summits will take place in Brussels, Europe. Important for the security of each of us. NATO Summit. EU Summit. G7 Summit. I'm sure people will show how they support us. But politicians must also support freedom. All of them. They must support the struggle for life. We are waiting for meaningful steps. From NATO, the EU and the G7. We know that the Russians have already begun to lobby their interests. These are the interests of war. We know that they are working with some partners. We know that they want to put this issue out. The struggle against war. But this is the war that needs to be put out.  Our firm position will be represented at these three summits. At these three summits we will see: Who is a friend, who is a partner, and who betrayed us for money. Life can be defended only when united. Freedom must be armed. Ukrainian sky has not been made safe from Russian missiles and bombs. We have not received aircraft and modern anti-missile weapons. We have not received tanks, anti-ship equipment. Russian forces can keep killing thousands of our citizens, destroying our cities. Just because there are too many invaders. Just because Russia has been preparing for such a war for decades. We asked to close our sky. And we asked for assistance from NATO to be effective and without limits. Any support in weapons that we need. We asked the Alliance to say it will fully help Ukraine win this war, clear our territories of the invaders and restore peace in Ukraine.  Free people of the free world!  Together we must prevent Russia from breaking someone in NATO, EU or G7. From breaking and taking it to the war side. We will see on March 24. Ukrainians! All our heroes! A month has passed. We withstood six times longer than the enemy had planned, than the Russian command had reported to the Russian president. They were convinced that Ukraine is not a state. They were convinced that Ukrainians are not a nation. They deceived themselves. But we don't care about them. This is their state suicide. And we are just protecting our lives. Our freedom. Our own state. Our children. Hence, our future. This is a war for independence. And we must win. We will rebuild every city that heroically resists. We will bring the invaders to justice for every crime. Zhytomyr and Sumy, Kyiv and Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, Volnovakha and Mykolaiv, Okhtyrka and Hostomel, Kherson and Odesa, Izyum and Donetsk, Luhansk and Chornobaivka... All our people will live! In a free Ukraine. After our victory. Which will come sooner, the more we will all be united. We are all Ukrainians. We are all Europeans. We are all free people of the free world. In unity! On the battlefield and in political positions, at rallies and summits, at work and in communication with people. By all our actions, we must force Russia to seek peace. By all our actions, we must bring the victory of freedom closer. May the memory of all who died for Ukraine live forever! Eternal glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"
"Speech by the President of Ukraine at a joint meeting of the Senate, the National Assembly of the French Republic and the Council of Paris",2022-03-23T18:00:00Z,"Ladies and gentlemen senators! Ladies and gentlemen deputies! Councillors of Paris! French people! Thank you for the honor of speaking to you today. I am sure that you are well aware of what is happening in Ukraine. You know why this is happening. And you know who is to blame. Even those who hide their heads in the sand know. And whose hands are still trying to get money from Russia. So today I am addressing you. Honest, brave, rational and freedom-loving. I am addressing you with questions: how to stop the war? How to return peace to our state? Because most of the puzzles that make up the answer are in your hands. On March 9, Russian bombs were dropped on a children's hospital and a maternity hospital in our city of Mariupol. It was a peaceful city in the south of Ukraine. Absolutely peaceful - until Russian troops approached and besieged it, as in the Middle Ages. Until they began to torture people with famine, thirst, kill with fire. There were people in the maternity hospital on which the Russians dropped bombs. There were women in labor. Most of them were saved. Some were seriously injured. One woman had to have her foot amputated, as it was completely shattered. And another woman... She had a shattered pelvis. Her child died before birth. Doctors tried to save the woman. Fought for her life! But she begged the doctors for her death. She begged to leave her, not to help her. Because she didn't know what to live for. They fought. She died. In Ukraine. In Europe. In 2022. When hundreds of millions of people could not even think that it could be so, that the world could be so ruined. I ask you now to honor the memory of thousands of Ukrainian men and women, all those who were killed as a result of Russia's invasion of the territory of our peaceful Ukraine with a moment of silence. After weeks of Russian invasion, Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities hit by the occupiers resemble the ruins of Verdun. As in the photos of the First World War, which, I'm sure, each and every one of you saw. The Russian militaries do not care which targets to hit. They destroy everything: residential neighborhoods, hospitals, schools, universities. Warehouses with food and medicine are being burned. They burn everything. They do not take into account concepts such as ""war crime"" and ""binding conventions"". They brought terror to Ukraine, state terror. Each and every one of you is aware of this. All information is available. All the facts are there. About women raped by the Russian military in the temporarily occupied areas. About refugees shot on the roads. About journalists they kill knowing for sure that they are journalists. About old people who survived the Holocaust and are now forced to save themselves from Russian attacks on peaceful cities in bomb shelters. For 80 years, Europe has not seen the things that are happening in Ukraine now. Because of Russia's actions. When there are people so desperate that they beg for death! Like this woman. In 2019, when I became President, there was already a format for negotiations with Russia. It was the Normandy format. The format of negotiations that were to end the war in Donbas. The war in eastern Ukraine, which has been going on for 8 years, unfortunately. Four countries took part in the Normandy format - Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France. Four, but through them the whole world, all positions were represented. Someone supported. Someone was trying to delay the process. Someone wanted to ruin everything. But it seemed important that the world was always present at that Normandy table, the table of peace. And when the negotiations yielded the result, when we managed to free people from captivity, when we were able to agree on some decisions in December 2019, it was like a breath of fresh air. Like a glimmer of hope. Hope that talks with Russia can help. That the Russian leadership can be convinced in words so that Moscow chooses peace. But February 24 came. A day that ruined all those efforts. All of us. Ruined the old meaning of the word ""dialogue"". Ruined the European experience of relations with Russia. Ruined decades of European history. All this was bombed by Russian troops. Destroyed by Russian artillery. Burned after Russian missile strikes. The truth was not found in the offices. So now we have to look for it and gain it on the battlefield. So what now? What do we have left? Our values. Unity. And the determination to defend our freedom. Common freedom! One for Paris and Kyiv. For Berlin and Warsaw. For Madrid and Rome. For Brussels and Bratislava. Sips of fresh air will definitely not help anymore. It makes sense to act together. To put pressure together. To force Russia to seek peace. Ladies and Gentlemen! French people! On February 24, the Ukrainian people united. Today we have no right or left. We do not look at who is in power and who is in opposition. The usual policy ended on the day of Russia's invasion and will resume only when there is peace. And this is right - to fight for life. To protect our state. We are grateful to you, we are grateful that France helps. We are grateful for the efforts of President Macron. Who showed true leadership. We are constantly communicating with him, it is true, we are coordinating some of our steps. Ukrainians see that France values freedom as much as it has always been. And you protect it. You remember what it is. Freedom, equality, brotherhood. Each of these words is full of power for you! I feel it. Ukrainians feel it. That is why we expect from you, we expect from France, from your leadership, that you will be able to make Russia seek peace. To make it end this war against freedom. Against equality. Against brotherhood. Against everything that made Europe united and full of free diverse life. We expect from France, from your leadership, that Ukraine's territorial integrity will be restored. And together we can do it. If among the attendees there are those who doubt it, your people are already sure. Like other nations of Europe. And that during France's presidency in the European Union the long overdue historical decision will be made - on Ukraine's full membership in Europe and the EU. Historical decision in historical time. As has always been the case in the history of the French people. Ladies and Gentlemen! French people! Tomorrow will be a month since Ukrainians have been fighting for their own lives, for their own freedom, since our army has been heroically opposing the overwhelming forces of Russia. We need more help! We need more support! In order for freedom not to lose, it must be well-armed. Tanks and anti-tank weapons, aviation and air defense. We need all this! You can help us. I know. You can! In order for freedom not to lose, the world must support it with sanctions against the aggressor. A new sanctions package every week. Every week! French companies must leave the Russian market. Renault, Auchan, Leroy Merlin and others. They must cease to be sponsors of Russia's military machine, sponsors of the killing of children and women, sponsors of rape, robbery and looting by the Russian army. All companies must remember once and for all that values are worth more than profit. Especially profit on blood. And we must already think about the future. About how we will live after this war. Guarantees are needed. Strong guarantees. Guarantees that security will be unshakable, that there will be no war, and that war in general will be impossible. We are creating such a system of guarantees. A new security system. In which France, I believe, will play a leading role. So that no one will ever have to beg for death again! So that people live their life. Full life. And so that we say goodbye to people not under bombs, not in war, but when the time comes. Only in peace. Only in dignity. Because you have to live so that you are respected. So that you are remembered. And so that people say goodbye to you in a way France said goodbye to the great Belmondo. Thank you, France! Glory to Ukraine!"
"Olena Zelenska told Le Parisien about the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, coordination of efforts with the first ladies to support Ukrainians abroad",2022-03-23T13:37:00Z,"First Lady Olena Zelenska gave an interview about the war between Russia and Ukraine to one of the most popular French media Le Parisien. The newspaper has covered the events in France and the world since 1944.  The wife of the President of Ukraine spoke about the coordination of humanitarian aid during the war, cooperation with the First Ladies of Poland and France to organize the rescue of children with cancer and stressed that words matter, because in our country there is a full-scale war, not ""Ukrainian crisis"" or “special military operation”. Saving Ukrainian children with cancer is an unprecedented action in world medical practice. Thanks to the joint efforts of doctors from Ukraine and abroad, public and charitable organizations, international partners and volunteers, it was possible to organize ""flights of life"". This allowed young Ukrainians and their parents to get to safe places and continue treatment. Six groups of patients have already been sent, and several more flights are planned. More than 300 children were able to continue treatment in clinics in Europe, the United States and Canada. ""Children do not part with loved ones, they go together. After all, oncology is a personal war for every family that has suffered from cancer. Imagine: they have to fight on two frontlines - disease and military circumstances. This is a very difficult ordeal,"" said Olena Zelenska. The First Lady thanked international partners and citizens of European countries who sheltered Ukrainians, provided support and assistance. At the same time, she reiterated her call on the OSCE, the Red Cross, UNICEF and other organizations to ensure genuine humanitarian corridors in Ukraine. The President's wife reminded of more than 100 children who died in our country since the beginning of the war, as well as more than 15 thousand babies born in basements, bomb shelters, maternity hospitals under shelling. Olena Zelenska also commented on the work on providing Ukrainian hospitals with incubators for newborns. The first two are already delivered to the Mykolaiv regional children's hospital. Kharkiv is next. ""It is no longer news that the Russians are deliberately destroying and damaging hospitals. And now children not only have to be born in bomb shelters - their lives are threatened by a lack of electricity. But whatever happens to the infrastructure, we will not allow the enemy to kill newborn Ukrainians,"" the First Lady stressed."
Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Parliament of Japan,2022-03-23T12:37:00Z,"Dear Mr. Hosoda! Dear Mrs. Santō! Mr. Prime Minister Kishida! Distinguished Members of the Japanese Parliament! Dear Japanese people! It is a great honor for me, the President of Ukraine, to address you for the first time in the history of the Japanese Parliament. Our capitals are separated by a distance of 8 thousand 193 kilometers. On average, it's 15 hours on a plane. Depending on the route. But what is the distance between our feelings of freedom? Between our desires to live? Between our aspirations for peace? On February 24, I did not see any distance. Even a millimeter between our capitals. Even a second between our feelings. Because you immediately came to our aid. And I'm grateful to you for that. When Russia destroyed peace for the entire Ukraine, we immediately saw that the world is truly against the war. Truly for freedom. Truly for global security. Truly for the harmonious development of every society. Japan has become the leader of this position in Asia. You immediately started working to stop this brutal war started by the Russian Federation. You immediately started working for peace in Ukraine. Hence, in Europe. And this is really very important. It is important for everyone on Earth. Because without peace for Ukraine, no person in the world will be able to look to the future with confidence. Each of you knows what Chornobyl is. Nuclear power plant in Ukraine, where a powerful explosion occurred in 1986. Radiation release. The consequences of which have been recorded in different parts of the planet. The 30-kilometer zone around the Chornobyl station is still closed. It is hazardous. During the elimination of the consequences of the explosion at the station, thousands of tons of contaminated materials, debris and cars were disposed of in the forests in the closed area. Just in the ground. On February 24, Russian armored vehicles passed through this land. Lifting radioactive dust into the air. The Chornobyl station was captured. By force, by weapon. Imagine a nuclear power plant where a disaster happened. Confinement that closes the destroyed reactor. Operating nuclear waste storage facility. Russia has turned this facility into an arena of war as well. And Russia is using this 30-kilometer territory, this closed zone, to prepare new attacks against our defense forces. It will take years after Russian troops leave Ukraine to investigate the damage they have done to Chornobyl. What sites of radioactive materials disposal were damaged. And how radioactive dust spread on the planet. Ladies and Gentlemen! There are four operating nuclear power plants on our land! These are 15 nuclear units. And they are all under threat. Russian troops have already fired from tanks at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. The fighting has damaged hundreds of plants, many of them particularly dangerous. The shelling threatens gas and oil pipelines. Coal mines. The other day, Russian troops also fired at a chemical plant in the Sumy region of Ukraine. There was a leak of ammonia. We are warned about possible chemical attacks, in particular with the use of sarin. As it was in Syria. And one of the main topics for discussion of world politicians is the question: how to react if Russia also uses nuclear weapons. Any confidence of any person in the world, any country is completely destroyed. Our servicemen have been heroically defending Ukraine for 28 days already. 28 days of full-scale invasion of the largest state in the world. But not the greatest in potential. Not the most influential. And the smallest from a moral point of view. Russia has used more than a thousand missiles against peaceful cities in Ukraine. Countless bombs. Russian troops destroyed dozens of our cities. Some were burned to the ground. In many towns and villages that have come under Russian occupation, our people cannot even bury their murdered relatives, friends and neighbors with dignity. They have to bury them right in the yards of broken houses, near roads, anywhere where it is possible... Thousands were killed, including 121 children. About 9 million Ukrainians were forced to leave their home, their native places, fleeing from Russian troops. Our northern territories, eastern, southern are becoming empty, because people are fleeing from this deadly threat. Russia has even blocked the sea for us. Usual trade routes. Showing some other - potential - aggressors of the world how to put pressure on free nations by blocking sea navigation. Ladies and Gentlemen! Today, it is Ukraine, the partner states and our anti-war coalition that can guarantee that world security will not be completely destroyed. That in the world there will be a foothold for the freedom of nations. For people and for the preservation of diversity in societies. For security of borders. To make sure that we, our children, our grandchildren still have peace. You see that international institutions have not worked. Even the UN and the Security Council... What can they do? They need reform. They need an injection of honesty. To become effective. To really decide and really influence, not just discuss. Due to Russia's war against Ukraine, the world is destabilized. The world is on the verge of many new crises. And who is now sure what tomorrow will be like? Turbulence in world markets is a problem for all countries that depend on imports of raw materials. Environmental and food challenges are unprecedented. And most importantly, it is now being decided whether all the aggressors on the planet - explicit and potential - will be convinced that the war they have waged will lead to a punishment so powerful that they should not start a war. That they should not destroy the world. And it is absolutely logical and correct that the responsible states unite to protect peace. I am grateful to your state for its principled position at such a historic moment. For real help to Ukraine. You were the first in Asia to put real pressure on Russia to restore peace. Who supported the sanctions against Russia. And I urge you to continue to do so. I call for the united efforts of the Asian countries, your partners, to stabilize the situation. So that Russia seeks peace. And stops the tsunami of its brutal invasion of our state, Ukraine. It is necessary to impose an embargo on trade with Russia. It is necessary to withdraw companies from the Russian market so that the money does not go to the Russian army. It is necessary to help our state, our defenders, our soldiers who are holding back Russian troops even more. It is necessary to start thinking about rebuilding Ukraine already now. About the return of life to the cities destroyed by Russia and the territories devastated by it. People need to go back to where they lived. Where they grew up. Where they feel is their home. Their small homeland. I'm sure you understand this feeling. This need. The need to return to your land. We need to develop new security guarantees. So that it is possible to act preventively and strongly every time there is a threat to peace. Is it possible to do this on the basis of existing international structures? After such a war - definitely not. We need to create new tools. New guarantees. Which will work preventively and strongly against any aggression. Which will really help. Japan's leadership can be indispensable in their development. For Ukraine, for the world. I offer it to you. So that the world can feel confident again. Confident about what tomorrow will be like. Confident that tomorrow will come and will be stable and peaceful. For us, for future generations. Ladies and Gentlemen! Japanese people! We can do a lot together with you. Even more than we can imagine. I know what a brilliant history of development you have. How you can build and defend harmony. Follow the principles and value life. Protect the environment. The roots of this are in your culture. Which Ukrainians really love. My words are not unsubstantiated. This is actually true. Back in 2019, literally six months after I became President of Ukraine, my wife Olena took part in a project for children with visual impairments. In the project to create audiobooks. And she voiced Japanese fairy tales. In Ukrainian. Because they are understandable for us, for children. And it was only a drop in the huge sea of our attention, the Ukrainian attention, to your attainment. We have similar values with you despite the huge distance between our countries. A distance that doesn't really exist. Because we have equally warm hearts. Thanks to joint efforts, thanks to even greater pressure on Russia, we will come to peace. And we will be able to rebuild our country. Reform international institutions.  I am sure that Japan will be with us then - just as it is now. In our anti-war coalition. At this crucial time for all of us. Thank you! Arigato gozaimasu! Glory to Ukraine! Glory to Japan!"
A website for targeted humanitarian aid in Ukraine has been created - President,2022-03-23T09:19:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the creation of help.gov.ua website, through which anyone can provide humanitarian aid. The Head of State spoke about this in his address. According to the President, in the last two weeks alone, Ukraine has received more than 100,000 tons of humanitarian aid. These cargoes are quickly distributed through special hubs for the regions. But there are even more appeals for help. ""Therefore, to simplify the process as much as possible, help.gov.ua website was created. On the website you can learn how to buy, how to send and whom to address humanitarian aid. This is for everyone who wants to join. For anyone who can help. In Ukraine and in the world. So that the aid is sent constantly, 24/7,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted.  "
"The G7, NATO and EU summits, new sanctions packages and new assistance take place this week - address by the President of Ukraine",2022-03-23T00:02:00Z,"Free people of a free country! Today was one of those days that allows us to say with confidence that the whole world is with us. In the morning I spoke with His Holiness Pope Francis about the search for peace for Ukraine, for our state, about the atrocities of the occupiers, about the humanitarian corridors to the besieged cities. I thanked His Holiness for a clear and strong position against the war and for his prayers for Ukraine. I invited him to visit our country at this crucial time. I believe that we will be able to organize this important visit, which will unequivocally support each of us, each of the Ukrainians. I addressed both chambers of the Italian parliament today. I felt maximum support. Sincere warmth in words. I called on Italy to strengthen sanctions against Russia and its regime. And strike hard at all Russian figures responsible for this war. For the war against us. Strike at their real estate, accounts and yachts. Strike at their habit to earn money by war and to live and have a rest far away, in Europe, where it is peaceful and cozy. I am sure that new sanctions will be introduced this week. And I am grateful to Italy for supporting Ukraine's membership in the EU. I spoke with President of Slovakia Zuzana Čaputová. About our cooperation and our security. About the development of Ukraine - with all together, in the European Union. An important conversation also took place with the Prime Minister of Canada. We continue to coordinate our positions on the eve of this week's NATO and G7 summits. Justin Trudeau will support us. A special aspect is security guarantees for Ukraine. They are vital not only for us, but also for all neighboring countries. Because of our security, which will cement peace in Eastern Europe. I am grateful to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Greece who was the first European official to decide to support the work of our humanitarian corridors in Mariupol. To evacuate our people from the city and bring in humanitarian aid, which is crucially important for everyone. As of today, there are about a hundred thousand people in the city. In inhumane conditions. In a complete blockade. No food, no water, no medicine. Under constant shelling, under constant bombing. For more than a week now we have been trying to organize stable humanitarian corridors for Mariupol residents. And almost all our attempts, unfortunately, are disrupted by the Russian occupiers. By shelling or deliberate terror. Today, one of the humanitarian columns was simply captured by the occupiers. On the agreed route near Manhush. SES employees and bus drivers were taken prisoner. We are doing everything we can to free our people and unblock the movement of humanitarian aid. That is why I am grateful when a high-level representative of a European state agrees to personally join the humanitarian mission. We expect the implementation of this plan by the Greek Foreign Minister in the coming days. Despite all the difficulties, 7,026 Mariupol residents were rescued today. Tomorrow we will continue this important work. Our representatives are trying to agree on humanitarian corridors in the Kyiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Luhansk regions. Another important news is that an online tool has been created for everyone who can and wants to help with humanitarian goods for Ukraine. In the last two weeks alone, our country has received more than 100,000 tons of humanitarian aid. These cargoes are quickly distributed through special hubs for the regions. But there are even more appeals. Even more opportunities. Even more work. Therefore, to simplify the process as much as possible, the website help.gov.ua was created. On the website you can learn how to buy, how to send and whom to address humanitarian aid. This is for everyone who wants to join. For anyone who can help. In Ukraine and in the world. So that the aid is sent constantly, 24/7. Our Armed Forces pleased us today. Chornobaivka again - the defeat of the occupiers again. Russian planes were shot down again. Especially important - the bomber was shot down over Mariupol. And so it will be with everyone who kills our people, peaceful people on our peaceful land. I want to repeat once again to all Russian pilots who do not think about the order they fulfill. Killing civilians is a crime. And you will be responsible anyway. Today or tomorrow - this is less important. The main thing is that it is inevitable. We continue to work at various levels to force Russia to peace. To the end of this brutal war. Ukrainian representatives are working on the negotiations, which continue virtually every day. It's very difficult. Sometimes scandalous. But step by step we are moving forward. I am also grateful to all the international mediators who are fighting for Ukraine, for Europe, for the truth. Who bring to Moscow the real picture. Honest. And encourage to look realistically. At what happens in battles. And at the fact that the world will not stop defending the truth. Our truth. Three important summits this week: the G7, NATO and the EU. New sanctions packages, new aid. We will work, we will fight in any way we can. Till the end. Bravely and openly. At all these sites. With full energy. For the result. With all our strength. And we will not get tired. Let's rest when we win. And it definitely will happen. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"
Speech by Head of the Office of the President Andriy Yermak at Chatham House,2022-03-22T22:17:00Z,"The hardest part of any speech is the beginning. You all probably know that. In other circumstances, I would have spent a lot of time on it. On the right, most appropriate beginning. But I don't have time. So I'll start with the simple. We have been told for years that Ukraine is not reforming properly. But let's look at the results. The modernized Armed Forces have been holding back the aggression of one of the world's most powerful armies for almost a month already. Logistics chains are functioning. The courts are working. Trains run and transport millions of people. Utilities are doing their job even under shelling and bombing. The test of war is perhaps the most severe. We are successfully reforming even now. And our sustainability turned out to be absolutely real. But sustainability is not an absolute category. It's not about availability, it's about measure. How much is left? Depends on many factors: We now enjoy serious support. The West has finally become collective. This is evidenced by sanctions against Russia and support for Ukraine - humanitarian, economic, political, military and technical. But is that enough? And for how long will the West keep it? For how long are those states that have sought to maintain economic ties with Russia at all costs, even in the face of Russia's invasion of Ukraine willing to suffer losses from disruption of these ties? Given the experience of the previous eight years, we cannot be too optimistic here. However, now the risks for the whole world have grown so much that they will simply not be allowed to do business as usual. The next factor is the factor of Russia itself. What is its margin of safety? What are its goals? The West is constantly talking about increasing the price that Russia will have to pay for aggression. But can we imagine the limit beyond which the Russian leadership will say: it is too expensive? It should be understood that the narrative of ""victory at any cost"" is not just a propaganda cliche. Moscow has repeatedly instrumentalized it, beating the stake of those it considered enemies. In the number of victims. In the violation of international law. In resorting to blackmail, including threats of man-made disasters and unconventional weapons. In everything. This must be understood. At the same time, it should be understood that ""small victorious wars"" that do not achieve their goal always increase Russia's risk of a social explosion and coup. Success in war, on the other hand, stabilizes and preserves the regime. Nourishes its desire for further conquests. You may ask, what is the conclusion? And the conclusion is that Ukraine must win the war that Russia has started against us. We must work only for such a result. All of us. What is happening in Ukraine now concerns everyone. Everyone in this room. Every government. Everyone in the world. The war in Ukraine is not just another local conflict. This is a world war that is so far going on in our country. I would like to emphasize once again that Russia's encroachments go far beyond Ukraine. It claims to restore the Soviet sphere of influence in both Europe and Asia. It claims to break the entire system of international relations and discredit all security institutions. Therefore, Kazakhstan, Poland, the Baltic States, Slovakia, Moldova, and Georgia may be next… Yes, Moldova and Georgia again. Georgia, which after Saakashvili is again afraid to say the wrong word to Moscow. Well, apparently, this is such a non-trivial course of Tbilisi's European integration. On the Russian military equipment they write ""To Berlin!"" once again. Do you know what that means? We know. The Israelis know. Believe those who promise to kill you. In the case of Ukraine, the goal of Russia is one - to destroy. To deprive of agency. To stop nation building. According to the program thesis about one nation, which we have been hearing for two decades. Therefore, one may say that this war has no rational basis. It is a war of will, not of necessity. But this is probably the first historiosophical war in history. Therefore, we must assume that the current leadership of Russia will not abandon this goal. And it is ready to pay. The question of whether its entourage is willing to pay can now be omitted. So let's focus on this - the intention to destroy Ukraine. This was not achieved by rapid operation. None of the strategic tasks of the invading force were fulfilled. Therefore, the aggressor is trying to provoke a humanitarian catastrophe, destroy critical civilian infrastructure and industrial potential. We must take into account that the war is taking place on our territory. That our people are dying, that our cities are being destroyed. Our Armed Forces and citizens are holding on with superhuman courage, but we cannot win the war without offensive weapons, without medium-range missiles that can be a means of deterrence (I emphasize: in our case - deterrence, not aggression) threatening Russian territory with comparative destruction. Without a full Lend-Lease, we can only defend ourselves. But it is impossible to defend effectively for a long time without a reliable echelon of air defense systems that shoot down enemy ballistic missiles at a long distance. However, we are not given it. Just as we are not given fighter jets. Just as we are not welcome in NATO. This fear of escalation is understandable. But this fear will not save you. Winston Churchill explained everything: he who chooses shame between shame and war, gets both shame and war. I once produced ""Forebodings"" movie directed by the talented Vyacheslav Kristofovich. So, the protagonist has such a remarkable phrase: ""Everything must happen on time."" Today I feel the power of this phrase more than ever. Everything must happen on time. Now it is high time. An extraordinary meeting of the Allies is scheduled to take place in Brussels this Thursday, March 24. There is still time to take concrete steps towards Ukraine. Or to say honestly and publicly that there will be no such steps. That NATO is refusing to allow Ukraine to join, not Ukraine is refusing to join, as many have been trying to pretend lately. To say - and together start building a new security system. The Russian leadership understands only the language of power and always confuses peacefulness with weakness. I want to ask our European partners: what are you really like? Are you peaceful or weak? Will you finally give us the weapons that will allow Ukraine to remain an independent sovereign state within internationally recognized borders? Will you finally launch a full-fledged Lend-Lease for us? Or will you continue to watch with concern as our cities turn into ruins? I'll just say simply: close our skies or at least give us long-range air defense systems. Your fear of escalation nurtures aggression. Your determination holds it back. Clearly articulated position ""We will shoot down planes that are instruments of terror. We will destroy the Russian air defense systems that will attack our air police,” is what we need. Tomorrow. Now. Yesterday. Otherwise, Ukraine will bleed out. Become depopulated. We will not surrender, it is already clear to everyone. But let me remind you what I said at the beginning: sustainability is not about availability, but about measure. After the Russian occupation of Crimea and the invasion of Donbas, foreign experts began to talk about the ""Finlandization"" of Ukraine. They meant only one thing: neutral status and ""special"" relations with Russia. But for some reason none of them said that ""Finlandization"" is the preservation of the state, its agency and the freedom of the people at the cost of the forced loss of certain territories as a result of aggression. But we will not give up our sovereignty or territorial integrity. And when we return our territories at the cost of incredible efforts and sacrifices, it will be our victory, but not Russia's defeat. Because without decisive actions of the world community, nothing will prevent the aggressor from continuing to strike at any place of our state. And every such blow to Ukraine will be a blow to international law. The intensification of the refugee crisis in the EU. The collapse of the world security system and the institutions that guarantee it. After all, it is a blow to global food security. In fact, all this is a key sign of a world order crisis. An order where the readiness of the international community to punish acts of aggression, punish genocide remains largely declarative. Profit over justice - was that why the UN was created? Has Europe united around this? If so, none of the existing security systems is suitable for Ukraine. We need a new one. Fair. This system will have to be built from scratch. We are ready. And we paid for it. Paid the highest price - pain, sweat, blood, lives. This fee gives us the moral right to demand: act! Right now! To put it simply, the ""Finlandization"" of Ukraine or any other model of neutralization on Russian terms, which does not involve building a new security system, will only guarantee that these challenges and threats will last forever. So I will ask: European countries, where will your refugees flee to? Ukraine remains Europe's only shield. But what happens if this shield is critically damaged? The half-hearted position of the world community, unfortunately, makes this scenario possible. In this case, reliable guarantees of our security become fundamentally important for us. Multilateral legally binding guarantees. But is there anything as reliable in the West as the NATO umbrella? Sorry, we are not aware of that. And the world needs the same credible assurances that Russia will no longer be able to successfully pursue its military ambitions in the international arena. We demand such guarantees from our partners. Citizens of other states, demand such guarantees from your government officials. Demand now, because tomorrow will be late. Without such guarantees, any of our agreements will be fragile and temporary. And they will hold until the moment when Russia regains its strength and tries to attack again. The timing of this will depend directly on the pace of easing of sanctions pressure on Russia and its ability to circumvent restrictive measures. We therefore call for steady and unwavering strengthening of these sanctions. International businesses should not think about how to bypass them for the sake of profits. They must not become an accomplice in crimes against humanity. Such complicity should not only be a burden on the conscience. We call on foreign governments to prosecute such collaborations. Up to the criminal liability. President Zelenskyy said this very clearly: ""Do not sponsor Russia's military machine. No euro for the occupiers. Close all your ports to them, do not supply goods, give up Russian energy resources, force Russia to leave Ukraine. I believe that peace is possible, but you must act to come to peace."" Governments are hesitant. But ordinary people have already made a choice. They are convinced that Ukraine has a place in the EU. This is the average opinion of 71% of respondents. 79% of Europeans believe that sanctions against Russia are the right thing to do. 67% of EU citizens believe that Ukraine needs to be provided with weapons. These are the results of a poll published by the French Institute of Public Opinion (IFOP). These figures are more than eloquent. So I will tell governments to finally listen to your voters. We call on the international community - not only the collective West, but also China and India - to put aside discord among themselves. The war in Ukraine affects all of you. You are the leaders of this world. Someone will talk about the two poles. I'm talking about two parts of the whole. The Russian issue should not prevent you from reaching an agreement. The interpenetration of economies and integration is a much more powerful guarantee of global peace than the threat of mutual destruction. You can reach an agreement. Russia's aggression against Ukraine may seem to some a good opportunity to fulfill their own ambitions. However, in reality this is a false impression: hopes that the war will be ""localized"" in Ukraine are in vain. Without proper rebuff, Moscow will not stop, and each of its subsequent ventures will inevitably bring the world closer to the hot global conflict. The dramatic events in Ukraine, the heroic struggle of our country for freedom and democracy have shown the whole world: our east and west are together. Now we call on the world to become a little bit like Ukraine. East and West, stand together to protect the planet from those who seek to replace the force of law with the law of force."
"As a result of talks with Russia, Ukraine expects an end to aggression and withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory - Andriy Yermak",2022-03-22T20:45:00Z,"As part of the negotiation process with the Russian Federation, Ukraine expects to reach an agreement on ending the armed aggression against our state and withdrawing Russian troops from Ukrainian territory. This was stated by Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak during a video meeting at the Royal Institute of International Affairs Chatham House (UK). ""I hope that these agreements will primarily provide for a ceasefire, withdrawal of Russian troops to the territory of February 23, 2022, as well as consultations and talks on other issues on the return of our territories, the return of full control over the territories within the internationally recognized borders to the Ukrainian authorities,"" said Andriy Yermak. In addition, according to him, such agreements should provide for the construction of a new security system for Ukraine. ""We want this war to end as soon as possible. To end with agreements solely in the interests of our country. To end with what we gained, not what we lost. To end with the fact that we gained a new security system. There is no more time to wait, to think. There is no more time to delay this decision,"" said the Head of the President's Office. Andriy Yermak stressed that there can be no compromises regarding Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. ""We are ready to talk about any issues, we are ready to meet and these issues need to be addressed. You don't have to ignore them. Both the issue of Donbas and the issue of Crimea. And above all the issue of ending the war and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory. All this should be the subject of conversation. First of all, conversation between the President of Ukraine and the President of Russia,” the Head of the Office of the President noted. He stressed that the Ukrainian delegation is working 24/7 to organize a meeting of the heads of state. ""Significant work is underway, in which, in particular, our partners are participating. Therefore, of course, negotiations and agreements are the shortest way to end the war,"" Andriy Yermak summed up."
20 children - cancer patients arrived in France for treatment,2022-03-22T18:20:00Z,"20 Ukrainian children - cancer patients arrived for treatment in the French Republic. The plane with them and their loved ones landed in Paris the night before. They were personally met by the First Lady of France Brigitte Macron. Children will receive the necessary treatment and assistance. ""I am here because Olena Zelenska and I have agreed that we will meet you. In France, you are welcome and will be taken care of, and we will exchange information about your condition with the First Lady of Ukraine,"" said Brigitte Macron. The ""Flights of Life"" for Ukrainian children with cancer from combat zones have been organized since the first weeks of the war thanks to the agreements between President's wife Olena Zelenska and first ladies of other countries, leadership and ministries of health, as well as due to cooperation of volunteer and medical organizations (see the list below). To keep the logistics safe, first children with cancer are brought to Lviv - to the Western Ukrainian Specialized Children's Medical Center headed by Andriy Syniuta. There they are examined and provided with the necessary medical support. Then, accompanied by medical teams, children and their relatives are taken to Poland to a specially created Unicorn clinic. There, patients are assigned to permanent treatment in Poland or other European countries, the United States and Canada. ""There are those who have two wars at once in these terrible times. One that destroys their homes and cities. The other is personal, with an illness. These are the two frontlines for the children with cancer now. We can evacuate them from one war and help win another one,"" said Olena Zelenska. She expressed hope that Ukraine would be able to send for treatment all those who need it, so that children return healthy to a peaceful country. Thanks to the “Flights of Life” initiative, more than 300 young cancer patients and their parents were evacuated from Ukraine to continue treatment in clinics in Europe, the United States and Canada. Participants in the project on evacuation of Ukrainian children for treatment abroad: Ministry of Health of Ukraine, Professor Piotr Czauderna, International Society of Pediatric Oncology - SIOP, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Tabletochki Foundation, Zaporuka Charitable Foundation, Wings of Hope Charitable Foundation, With an Angel on Your Shoulder Charitable Foundation, Consulate General of the Republic of Poland in Lviv, Children's Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplant Clinic, Ukrainian Children's Oncology/Hematology Association, Lviv Regional State Administration, Lviv Regional Council."
Address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the Italian Chamber of Deputies,2022-03-22T13:35:00Z,"Dear speakers! Dear Mr. Prime Minister Draghi! Dear ladies and gentlemen, senators and deputies! Dear Italian people! This morning I spoke with His Holiness Pope Francis and he said very important words: “I understand that you want peace. I understand that you have to protect yourself. Both the servicemen and civilians courageously defend the homeland. Everyone is defending the homeland."" And I replied: ""Our people have become this army."" They became this army when they saw the trouble the enemy was causing. The devastation it leaves behind. And the huge amount of blood it wants to shed. When I addressed a rally in Florence and dozens of other European cities a little over a week ago, I asked all Italians, all Europeans to remember the number 79. The number of children killed in Ukraine at that time. Now it's 117. 38 children more during these days. This is the price of the delay. Delay with pressure on Russia. So that it ends this brutal war. 117 children, thousands of adults. Thousands wounded. Tens of thousands of destroyed families. Hundreds of thousands of ruined destinies. Millions, already millions of abandoned homes. And it all started with one person. In the occupied areas, murdered families are buried right in the yards of high-rise buildings. In the parks. In mass graves. This is happening today. In 2022. And we know that every next day of the war will take the lives of our children. 117 is not a final number. The Russian invasion will destroy more families and destinies. Unfortunately, the full-scale war continues. Russian missiles, aircraft and artillery do not stop killing. Ukrainian cities are being ruined. Some are almost completely destroyed. Like Mariupol. You heard of it. Our city on the shore of the Sea of Azov. Where about half a million people lived. Just as in your city of Genoa. I was there. And now there is nothing in Mariupol. Only ruins. Imagine completely burned Genoa. After three weeks of total blockade. Bombing, shelling, which did not stop for a moment. Ruined Genoa, from which people are being evacuated, your wonderful people. On foot, by cars, by buses... Just to get to where it is safe. I am addressing you from Kyiv, our capital. From a city that is as important to our region as Rome is to the whole world. The origin of the great culture of a great nation is in Kyiv. And now we are on the verge of survival. Kyiv has gone through brutal wars throughout its history. And it deserves, after all the losses and tragedies, to live in peace. In eternal peace. As Rome and any other city in our world deserves. But, unfortunately, there is an air alarm in Kyiv every day. Bombs and rockets fall every day. Near Kyiv, in neighboring towns and districts, there are several groups of Russian troops. Those who kill and torture, rape and kidnap children, destroy and rob. The occupiers take our property to Russia by trucks. The last one who did something like this in Europe were the Nazis. When they invaded other countries. Russian troops have even mined the sea near our ports. And now it threatens neighboring shores and neighboring countries, because mines can drift by sea to them. Ladies and Gentlemen! Italian people! It's time to do everything possible to ensure peace! This is a war that Russia has been preparing for a long time. Which one person has been preparing for a long time. One! For decades. Earning crazy money on oil and gas exports and directing them to prepare for war. And not only against Ukraine. Their goal is Europe. Decisive influence on your life, control over your policy, destruction of your values. Not only ours. Democracy, human rights, equality, freedom... The same values as ours. Ukraine is the gateway to Europe for Russian troops. They want to break in. But barbarism must not pass. Ukrainians were one of the first to come to your aid when you needed it during the COVID pandemic. We sent our doctors. Italians were among the first to come to our aid when our people were affected by the terrible floods. You supported us - sincerely, quickly. Without asking for anything in return. You are helping us now - we really appreciate it. But still... The invasion has not stopped in 27 days. Almost a month. So more sanctions are needed, even more pressure, so that Russia is looking not for military reserves or mercenaries somewhere in Libya or Syria, but for peace. So that the same one person is looking for peace. The consequences of this war are already felt in many parts of the world. Not only in Europe. And the worst thing will be famine. Approaching different countries. Ukraine has always been one of the largest exporters of food. But how can we sow under the blows of Russian artillery? How can we sow when the enemy deliberately mines the fields, destroys fuel bases? We do not know what harvest we will have and whether we’ll be able to export. When our ports are blocked and seized. Corn, vegetable oil, wheat and many other products. Vital goods. For your neighbors as well. Across the sea. Prices are already rising. So how many tens of millions of people will need help? In front of your shores... Ladies and Gentlemen! Italian people! You know Ukrainians well. Our people who never wanted to fight. Who are Europeans just like you. You know those who brought war to Ukraine. You know for sure. Those who order to fight. And those who promote it. Almost all of them use Italy. As a place for vacation. So don't be a resort for murderers. Block all their real estate, accounts and yachts - from ""Scheherazade"" to the smallest ones. Block the assets of all those who have influence in Russia. Let them apply their influence for peace. To be able to come back to you someday. Support greater sanctions against Russia. A complete embargo on trade, starting with oil. Support a ban on entering your ports for Russian ships. So that they feel the price for their aggression and for mining the sea. There should be no exceptions to the sanctions regime for any Russian bank. Do not allow the food crisis in your neighboring regions. Help us. Stop the killings. Save Ukrainian families. This war must end as soon as possible. Peace must be restored. Enemy troops must be withdrawn from Ukraine. Demining must be carried out. And reconstruction. Reconstruction of Ukraine after this war. Together with you, together with Italy. Together with Europe. Together - in the European Union. Before the war, I often visited your country. I appreciate your hospitality, sincerity and sometimes loudness. I saw what family and children mean to you. You have wonderful families, you have wonderful children. What life means to you. I want to thank you for helping the Ukrainians who found a shelter from this war in your country. Today, there are more than 70,000 of our people in Italy who, unfortunately, had to hide from the war. More than 25 thousand children. And many of them have received warmth in your Italian families. Including in the families present in this hall. The first Ukrainian was born in Italy, whose mother found refuge on your land. Dozens of Ukrainian children with severe shell shock and injuries are being treated by you. We are grateful to you for that, very grateful! And we are waiting for them to return home. To Ukraine - already peaceful. And you can definitely help us with that. From the first day of this war, you have shared our pain and are helping sincerely - from the heart. Ukrainians will always remember this. Your warmth, your care and your strength that must stop one person. Just one person for millions to survive. Glory to Ukraine! Grazie Italia!"
Europe must do everything for Russia not to feel like the ruler of the world - President of Ukraine,2022-03-22T09:33:00Z,"The European Union does not have to take up arms to fight the Russian threat - it needs to fight on the diplomatic and economic frontlines. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an interview for world broadcasters. ""Europeans can fight using sanctions - they have now started with sanctions. They are fighting using the blockade for the economy and Russian business, they are fighting using diplomacy. European leaders must start fighting,"" the President said. ""Ukraine's accession to the European Union is a war. You do not need to take a weapon. Russia does not support Ukraine as part of the Western world, they see us as part of post-Soviet life or Soviet life. And this is a war,"" he explained. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, European leaders must show readiness to fight Russia. This is necessary so that in the end they do not find themselves in the current situation in Ukraine, which could not imagine that it would fall victim to a full-scale invasion by a neighbor. ""You will just wake up one morning and understand what we understood - the war started. Europe must do everything for Russia not to feel like the ruler of the world, it is possible today,"" he said. The President reminded that the Ukrainian army had stopped the offensive of the Russian army - the second army in the world. So, there is no need to be afraid of Russia. It is necessary to convince it of the erroneous position on the choice of the future for Ukraine and its membership. ""They must limit the power of the Russian Federation, not allow it to earn on foreign markets, withdraw business. They must hurt it as much as it hurts us. We are in the basements, without water, without food, businesses do not work… Let them feel it. But do not bomb them with missiles, do not destroy the nation,"" said the President of Ukraine.
 "
,2022-03-22T08:34:00Z,"Russia should move away from ultimatums against Ukraine, because they will not lead to any results. We need to find a compromise to end the war. This was emphasized by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an interview for world broadcasters. ""When we can stop this war is a question now. I believe Russia should not use loud phrases, as they will not lead to anything. Like, ""we have an ultimatum, here are the points, do it, and then we will end the war."" It will not lead to anything, to any result. The problem is not in me… We all can't do it. Ukraine will not be able to fulfill the ultimatum. We lost people. That is, we must all be destroyed, and then the ultimatum will be automatically fulfilled,"" the President said. According to him, the fulfillment of the Russian ultimatum will actually lead to the destruction of the Ukrainian people, so it cannot be fulfilled physically. But Ukraine seeks peace, so it is open to dialogue. At the same time, increasing sanctions on Russia could deal a serious blow to its economic and domestic political situation. ""If we want peace, we need to sit down and talk. The right word is to negotiate. But to negotiate, not to fulfill the ultimatum. This is an important point. A compromise can be found in the dialogue,"" the President stressed. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that the issue of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity is a ""red line"", because many Ukrainians gave their lives for it. ""I said when I became president that we can no longer give away any part of our land. We must do everything to bring Donbas and Crimea back. This is not banality, everyone thinks about it and believes in it, all our people. It is a matter of time,"" he said. At the same time, according to the Head of State, speaking of certain compromises, it should be understood that they have a price. ""If people (Russian Federation - ed.) want to end the war, first cease fire, withdraw troops. The presidents met and agreed that the troops would be withdrawn, that there were certain security guarantees - compromise could be found here. There are certain guarantors of our security. They must say tomorrow that they are taking Ukraine into NATO. Or to say: now we do not take Ukraine. And they themselves understand that they do not want to go to war with Russia, so they do not take us. We all understand that already. They are not taking us because they are afraid of Russia,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. In this case, he said, there are other security guarantees. In particular, among NATO countries there are those who want to be the guarantors of Ukraine's security and are ready to act as the Alliance would act if our country was a member. ""And I think it's a normal compromise for everyone: for the West, which doesn't know what to do with us when it comes to NATO. For Ukraine, which wants security guarantees. And for Russia, which does not want NATO to expand further and says that it has had such agreements with Western countries. And that is why a compromise must be found in this, because this will be the end of the war,"" the President said. As for the occupied territories of Crimea and Donbas, the head of state noted that in order to find a solution to this issue, the first step should be taken in the form of security guarantees and an end to the war. ""At the first meeting with the President of Russia, I am ready to raise these issues, they are relevant, they are important to us. But I am sure that this solution will not be found at this meeting. Because to be completely frank, in matters of security guarantees, we will talk about constitutional changes, changes in Ukrainian legislation. And if we talk about it, it will in any case be decided not only by the President - it is a long enough process, it will be decided by the Verkhovna Rada and the people of Ukraine,"" he said. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, when it comes to certain issues of historical importance, “we will resort to a referendum."" ""People will have to respond to certain formats of compromises. But the compromises are a matter of conversation and understanding between Ukraine and Russia. Therefore, in any case, I am ready to do anything if I'm supported by the people of Ukraine,"" the President stressed.

It was another day that brought us all closer to victory - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-03-22T00:39:00Z,"Free people of a free country! Our 26th day of full-scale war is over. After 8 years of aggression in the east of our state. The enemy is slowly trying to move. To go on the offensive somewhere. To capture our road somewhere. To cross the river somewhere. The Ukrainian army - well done - repels these attempts. And holds back the occupiers. Today, Russian troops hit the Zhytomyr region with Grads. They got a decent answer. Another enemy aircraft was shot down in the Kharkiv region near Chuhuiv. Our military has already shot down so many Russian planes and helicopters that one can only wonder: what do their pilots have instead of mind? Is it also emptiness? I said “also” not by accident, because they definitely have emptiness instead of heart. Instead of soul. Instead of everything that makes a human human. Borys Romanchenko, a former prisoner of Nazi concentration camps, was killed in Kharkiv. He was 96 years old. Think about it - he went through so much! He survived in Buchenwald, Dora-Mittelbau, Peenemünde and Bergen-Belsen - the death conveyors created by the Nazis. And he was killed by a Russian projectile that hit an ordinary Kharkiv high-rise building... Each passing day of this war makes it increasingly clear what their ""denazification"" is. In Kherson, the occupiers shot at people who peacefully took to the streets without weapons at a rally for their freedom. For our freedom. The Russian soldiers do not even know what it is like to be free. They were driven here, to be honest, as if sentenced. Sentenced to death, sentenced to disgrace. A column of civilians came under fire in the Zaporizhzhia region. There were many children. Four children were hospitalized. Two are in grave condition. During the day 8 humanitarian corridors worked. Kyiv, Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Vorzel, Bucha, Velyka Dymerka, Mariupol, Lysychansk, Severodonetsk, Popasna and Kreminna. 8 thousand 57 people were rescued. Thank you to everyone who did it, who worked for the people. We also managed to deliver 200 tons of humanitarian aid. I spoke today with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Rutte and President of France Emanuel Macron. We are coordinating our positions on the eve of important summits in Europe. Meetings of the G7, leaders of NATO and the European Union will take place on March 24. Our position will definitely sound. It will sound, believe me, firmly. I signed a decree on awarding orders and medals to 105 of our warriors. I am grateful to each of them. 7 of them are, unfortunately, awarded posthumously. It was a day of difficult events. Difficult conclusions. But it was another day that brought us all closer to our victory. To peace for our state. Glory to Ukraine!"
"Drive the occupiers out, drive these slaves out: President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's address to the residents of Ukrainian cities",2022-03-21T21:17:00Z,"Great people of great Ukraine! In this video, I want to appeal separately to the Ukrainian cities and the brave inhabitants of these cities. To the free south of Ukraine, where the sun shines only to welcome guests, not to random ""tourists"" on tanks. To Berdyansk, Kakhovka, Enerhodar, Melitopol and, of course, Kherson. To Kherson, where today we saw slaves shooting at free people. Slaves of propaganda that replaces their consciousness. Slaves who used to pack everyone in paddy wagons. Even an old woman with a clean white poster. Even a girl with an A4 sheet on which only one word is written - ""peace"". These slaves sent by Russia have never seen so many free people in the squares and streets. They have never seen thousands of people who are not afraid of them, of slaves with weapons in their hands. Slaves perceive freedom as savagery, as danger. They are scared. The fear that propagandists know how to turn into hatred. And then - shots at peaceful free people. Kherson, hold on! We will never forget these shots. Shots from your city. We were all with you in your square and streets. 40 million Ukrainians of our state. Millions and millions of Ukrainians in the world. We've all seen you stand. We've seen who you are. We have all felt how you want to regain your freedom. On land, where, watching the Milky Way, the Chumaks went for salt, the enemies felt terrible. And as soon as we can break through to you, every occupier who shot at peaceful Kherson residents just for the blue-yellow color will have a black stripe. And the same awaits the Russian military pale from the fright who were driven out today in Enerhodar. Peaceful Ukrainians drove them out with bare hands. The occupiers in Berdyansk, Melitopol and Kakhovka will have a black stripe. Wherever the occupiers kidnap our people. Those who they think are organizing the resistance. But we are not Russia. Remember. And there is no need to organize resistance here. Resistance for Ukrainians is a feature of the soul. And I really want you, all our Ukrainians in the south, to never think even for a moment that Ukraine does not remember you. Whenever you are in pain, when you resist in spite of everything, please know that our hearts are broken at this time, because we are not with you. And we ask God to support you until we can drive strangers out. This is a feat that you are protesting. This is happiness that we have such people. That we are all Ukraine. During this invasion, heroes have constantly declared themselves among millions of our people. Once - ordinary Ukrainians, and now - fighters. Men and women who stand up for our state. Everywhere: in the south, in the east, in the north, in the center, in the west and abroad. Stand up so that the enemy does not believe that this is a reality. But we will make them believe. And we will make them remember that they are not welcome. And they will never be. In Kyiv, which stands bravely and majestically above the Dnieper. In Kharkiv... Proud, tidy, educated Kharkiv. Which they beat, and it does not obey. Chernihiv. Ancient! Chernihiv, which since the time of the Horde has not faced such atrocities committed by the Russian military now. Sumy, Okhtyrka and Lebedyn... Izyum, Derhachi ... Volnovakha, Popasna... Borodyanka, Hostomel, Makariv... Mykolaiv... Mariupol! Hardworking and honest city! Mariupol. Which the occupiers are simply destroying. Destroying to ashes. But it will survive them all. Worthless slaves who do not know how to take care of their own country. Of their own people. And they go to someone else's. We are fighting for every Ukrainian! And we remember everyone! We are grateful to everyone. Both to the people and to these beautiful cities. As well as to Lviv, as well as to Ivano-Frankivsk, Khmelnytskyi, Chernivtsi, Ternopil, Lutsk, our Uzhhorod... Kropyvnytskyi, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih... Vinnytsia, Rivne... Cherkasy, Poltava... Odesa! Those who may be infrequently mentioned in speeches. But who care about our common future. About Ukraine. And about freedom - for each of us. Who shelter people who have been forced to leave their home. Who work for defense. Who send humanitarian goods. Who deploy the evacuated businesses. Who heal, who help. Help all of us, and therefore themselves. Great people of great Ukraine! And I say this not accidentally - great Ukraine. Because I appeal to everyone in our country and to those abroad. In cities and villages. Those who are free and who are temporarily under occupation. In Crimea, in Donetsk, in Luhansk. Where they must also fight for freedom, not sit and wait. I appeal to all Ukrainians. Wherever we are. Do everything to protect our state. To save our people. Fight. Fight and help. Drive these slaves out! Drive the occupiers out! So that Ukraine lives. So that all of us live with it. Free and peaceful. Which we love so much. Glory to Ukraine!"
We are working to make the whole world friends of Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-03-21T00:49:00Z,"Free people of a free country! The 25th day has come to an end since the Russian military has gone to the exercise and found themselves on our land. They all say so when taken captive.  It is already the 25th day since the Russian military has been vainly trying to find imaginary “Nazis” from whom they allegedly wanted to defend our people. Just as they are vainly trying to find Ukrainians who would meet them with flowers. At least in one city of our state. At least in one village. And most importantly - the Russian military cannot find a way home. That is why our soldiers help them with the path to God's judgment. To God's judgment where I am sure they receive only one punishment, one for all: the eternal cellar. Forever under the bombs. Forever without food, water and heat. For everything they did to our people, ordinary Ukrainians. To peaceful people. In Okhtyrka and Kharkiv, in Borodyanka and Chernihiv. In Volnovakha and Mariupol. And many of our other courageous cities. In besieged Mariupol, Russian aircraft dropped a bomb on an art school. People were hiding there. Hiding from shelling, from bombing. There were no military positions. There were about four hundred civilians. Mostly women and children, the elderly. They are under the debris. We do not know how many are alive at the moment. But we know that we will definitely shoot down the pilot who dropped that bomb. As we already did to almost a hundred other similar mass murderers. Today, in the Knesset, I addressed all deputies and government officials. But first of all, I spoke on your behalf, on behalf of all Ukrainians with the people of Israel, who, I am sure, understand us. As free people understand free people. Of course, Israel has its own interests, a strategy to protect its citizens. We understand that. Israeli Prime Minister Bennett is trying to find a way to negotiate with Russia. And we are grateful for that. For every effort. So that sooner or later we start talking to Russia, perhaps in Jerusalem. This is the right place to find peace. If it is possible. Well, Russian propagandists today have a rather difficult task. After all, for the first time in history, the president of a foreign state spoke in the Knesset via video call. And spoke to the people of Israel. The President of Ukraine accused in Moscow of ""Nazism” spoke in the Knesset to the people of Israel. This fact alone confirms how wrong things are in Moscow. During the day on March 20, only 4 humanitarian corridors worked. A total of 7,295 people were evacuated. Almost 4,000 Mariupol residents arrived in Zaporizhzhia in one day. Tomorrow morning we are preparing to send new buses to Mariupol to continue this important mission. More than 3,000 people were rescued in the Kyiv region. But in the Kharkiv region... Russian troops captured our convoy, our humanitarian cargo for the city of Vovchansk. There is no connection now with six people. Five drivers and one doctor. We will release them. We will try again and again to deliver to our people what they need. The Kherson region fought again today. I am grateful to them. Again on the streets. And as always - for all of us, for Ukraine. With national flags. And with our Ukrainian courage. Unarmed against the occupiers. Against shots and military vehicles. This is a feat that inspires us all. This is Ukraine we are proud of. These are Ukrainians to whom I am immensely grateful. Just as all our people are. In the afternoon I spoke with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson. A true friend of Ukraine who does not hesitate and does not seek excuses. We agreed on concrete support for our country at next week's G7 and NATO summits. Although we are not members of these organizations, I see that Ukraine has at least one vote there. I also spoke with Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis. A star couple who sincerely believe in us, in our victory, in our future. They help Ukrainian IDPs by raising funds. And the two of them have already raised $ 35 million. I thanked them on behalf of our people, on behalf of all of us. Agree, this is a good result for one couple of our friends in America. And we are working to make the whole world our friends. I personally presented state awards to Ukrainian intelligence officers. Please understand - I can't say their names publicly. But believe me, the contribution of these people to our defense is so significant that the orders and the title of Hero of Ukraine for them is the minimum we can give. Just to express gratitude. To them and to all our heroes. Thanks to which we are holding on. And we're doing it pretty well. And Ukraine lives. Glory to Ukraine!"
Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Knesset,2022-03-20T20:17:00Z,"Dear Mr. Speaker, members of the Knesset. Dear Prime Minister Bennett, thank you very much for your support. Dear members of the Government of the State of Israel, all attendees, guests, people of Israel! The Ukrainian and Jewish communities have always been and, I am sure, will be very intertwined, very close. They will always live side by side. And they will feel both joy and pain together. That is why I want to remind you of the words of a great woman from Kyiv, whom you know very well. The words of Golda Meir. They are very famous, everyone has heard of them. Apparently, every Jew. Many, many Ukrainians as well. And certainly no less Russians. ""We intend to remain alive. Our neighbors want to see us dead. This is not a question that leaves much room for compromise."" I don't need to convince you how intertwined our stories are. Stories of Ukrainians and Jews. In the past, and now, in this terrible time. We are in different countries and in completely different conditions. But the threat is the same: for both us and you - the total destruction of the people, state, culture. And even of the names: Ukraine, Israel. I want you to feel it all. I want you to think about this date. About February 24. About the beginning of this invasion. Russia's invasion of Ukraine. February 24 - this day has twice gone down in history. And both times - as a tragedy. A tragedy for Ukrainians, for Jews, for Europe, for the world. On February 24, 1920, the National Socialist Workers' Party of Germany (NSDAP) was founded. A party that took millions of lives. Destroyed entire countries. Tried to kill nations. 102 years later, on February 24, a criminal order was issued to launch a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. The invasion, which has claimed thousands of lives, has left millions homeless. Made them exiles. On their land and in neighboring countries. In Poland, Slovakia, Romania, Germany, the Czech Republic, the Baltic States and dozens of different countries. Our people are now scattered around the world. They are looking for security. They are looking for a way to stay in peace. As you once searched. This Russian invasion of Ukraine is not just a military operation, as Moscow claims. This is a large-scale and treacherous war aimed at destroying our people. Destroying our children, our families. Our state. Our cities. Our communities. Our culture. And everything that makes Ukrainians Ukrainians. Everything that Russian troops are now destroying. Deliberately. In front of the whole world. That is why I have the right to this parallel and to this comparison. Our history and your history. Our war for our survival and World War II. Listen to what the Kremlin says. Just listen! There are even terms that sounded then. And this is a tragedy. When the Nazi party raided Europe and wanted to destroy everything. Destroy everyone. Wanted to conquer the nations. And leave nothing from us, nothing from you. Even the name and the trace. They called it ""the final solution to the Jewish issue"". You remember that. And I'm sure you will never forget! But listen to what is sounding now in Moscow. Hear how these words are said again: ""Final solution"". But already in relation, so to speak, to us, to the ""Ukrainian issue"". It sounded openly. This is a tragedy. Once again, it was said at a meeting in Moscow. It is available on official websites. This was quoted in the state media of Russia. Moscow says so: without the war against us, they would not be able to ensure a ""final solution"" allegedly for their own security. Just like it was said 80 years ago. People of Israel! You saw Russian missiles hit Kyiv, Babyn Yar. You know what kind of land it is. More than 100,000 Holocaust victims are buried there. There are ancient Kyiv cemeteries. There is a Jewish cemetery. Russian missiles hit there. People of Israel! On the first day of this war, Russian projectiles hit our city of Uman. A city visited by tens of thousands of Israelis every year. For a pilgrimage to the tomb of Nachman of Breslov. What will be left of all such places in Ukraine after this terrible war? I am sure that every word of my address echoes with pain in your hearts. Because you feel what I'm talking about. But can you explain why we still turn to the whole world, to many countries for help? We ask you for help... Even for basic visas... What is it? Indifference? Premeditation? Or mediation without choosing a party? I will leave you a choice of answer to this question. And I will note only one thing - indifference kills. Premeditation is often erroneous. And mediation can be between states, not between good and evil. Everyone in Israel knows that your missile defense is the best. It is powerful. Everyone knows that your weapon is strong. Everyone knows you're doing great. You know how to defend your state interests, the interests of your people. And you can definitely help us protect our lives, the lives of Ukrainians, the lives of Ukrainian Jews. One can keep asking why we can't get weapons from you. Or why Israel has not imposed strong sanctions against Russia. Why it doesn't put pressure on Russian business. But it is up to you, dear brothers and sisters, to choose the answer. And you will have to live with this answer, people of Israel. Ukrainians have made their choice. 80 years ago. They rescued Jews. That is why the Righteous Among the Nations are among us. People of Israel, now you have such a choice. Thank you! Thank you for everything."
President presented state awards to employees of the Chief Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine,2022-03-20T18:26:00Z,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy presented state awards to employees of the Chief Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine who perform important tasks in resisting the Russian invasion. For special courage in combat and special missions, three employees were awarded orders. The Head of State conferred the title of Hero of Ukraine upon one warrior and awarded him the Golden Star Order for his personal courage and heroism. ""Your work is invisible to the public, but extremely important for Ukraine. You are our eyes and ears. Thanks to you, the political and military leadership of the state is able to make optimal decisions to deter the enemy and protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. I wish all of us victory, and you and your families - health, peace and prosperity,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy during the ceremony."
Andriy Yermak held a meeting with the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and diplomats on the delivery of humanitarian aid to Ukraine,2022-03-20T10:49:00Z,"Under the chairmanship of the Head of the Office of the President Andriy Yermak and with the participation of the First Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of Economy of Ukraine Yulia Svyrydenko, a meeting dedicated to the coordination of humanitarian aid from abroad was held with the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the heads of foreign diplomatic missions of our state.  During the event, the key directions in this work for the near future, as well as existing issues and ways to resolve them immediately were discussed. Following the discussion, the participants identified priorities in humanitarian aid to Ukraine, as well as agreed on ways to ensure its continuous flow in order, in particular, to form the necessary reserves."
"Seven humanitarian corridors are to be opened in the Kyiv, Donetsk and Kharkiv regions today - Deputy Prime Minister",2022-03-20T10:19:00Z,"As of March 20, seven humanitarian corridors have been agreed upon in Ukraine to evacuate residents of settlements affected by the Russian invasion, as well as to send aid. This was announced by Deputy Prime Minister - Minister for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories Iryna Vereshchuk. Evacuation from the city of Mariupol to the city of Zaporizhzhia is planned in the Donetsk region. ""Buses for Mariupol residents will be waiting in the square in front of the city sports complex in Berdyansk starting from 9:30 am. Departure to Zaporizhzhia is planned at 11:00 am,"" Iryna Vereshchuk said. According to her, in Berdyansk it will be possible to refuel private cars of Mariupol residents driving on the route to Zaporizhzhia. Addresses for refueling: 132a Kabelshchykiv Street and 87b Melitopol Highway. Transportation to Berdyansk and Zaporizhzhia has also been organized for Mariupol residents who will reach Manhush. The following humanitarian routes have been agreed upon in the Kyiv region: From the village of Bobryk to Brovary. Meeting place - House of Culture on 2 Shevchenko Street. From the village of Tarasivka to Brovary. Meeting place - 6 Ninth of January Street. From the urban-type settlement of Borodyanka to Bila Tserkva. Meeting place - 331 Tsentralna Street. Evacuation buses will depart from Brovary and Malyn. In the Kharkiv region, humanitarian goods will be sent from Kharkiv to the city of Vovchansk and the villages of Rohan and Nova Rohan. Delivery of food and medicine to these settlements is planned. The Deputy Prime Minister expressed hope for the effectiveness of today's humanitarian corridors."
"The more Russia uses terror against Ukraine, the worse the consequences will be for it - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-03-20T02:33:00Z,"Our strong people of our indomitable country! The 24th day of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine is over. After eight years of aggression. Ukrainians have proved that they know how to fight more professionally than an army that has been fighting for decades in different regions and under different conditions. We respond with wisdom and courage to the huge number of their equipment and soldiers sent to Ukraine. That is why, for example, the Ukrainian Chornobaivka will go down in war history. This is a place where the Russian military and their commanders have shown themselves completely as they are: incompetent, capable of simply driving their people to slaughter. Six times our military destroyed the occupiers near Chornobaivka. Six times! And they still come there. The besieged Mariupol will go down in history of responsibility for war crimes. The terror the occupiers did to the peaceful city will be remembered for centuries to come. And the more Ukrainians tell the world about it, the more support we find. The more Russia uses terror against Ukraine, the worse the consequences will be for it. Today I addressed the people of Switzerland. This is a special state. It does not elbow its way on the international stage. But when it speaks its word, it is heard by absolutely everyone. Switzerland has backed European Union sanctions against Russia. This means a lot for the Russian state machine. For people who are used to the fact that power is money. Hence, banks. Hence, Switzerland and other countries that help save capital. I am grateful to the President and to the people of Switzerland and to their country for their sincere support in our struggle for life and liberty. For not staying away. And I urged them to take a few more steps. So that all Swiss companies that have not yet left the Russian market do so immediately in order not to give a single dollar, franc or euro to a Russian military machine to kill our people. So that all those responsible for the war against our state cannot enjoy life in Switzerland, real estate in Switzerland, banks in Switzerland. Our Armed Forces continue to deter the enemy in all major areas. Inflict unprecedented losses on Russian troops. Some units of the occupiers were destroyed by 80-90%. In places of especially fierce battles, the frontline of our defense is simply piled with the corpses of Russian soldiers. And these corpses, these bodies, are not taken away. New units are driven on the offensive through these bodies. Some reserves that the command of the Russian troops collect wherever they can. We are well aware that Russia has just a bottomless human resource and a lot of equipment, missiles and bombs. But I want to ask the citizens of Russia. What have they done to you over the years that you stopped noticing your losses? Do the words “son”, “mother”, “father” mean nothing to you anymore? Already more than 14 thousand of your soldiers have been killed. This is 14 thousand mothers. This is 14 thousand fathers. These are wives, these are children, relatives and friends. And you don't notice it? But there will only be more victims. As long as this war continues. Your war against us, Russia against Ukraine. On our land. Eight humanitarian corridors worked on Saturday. 6623 people were rescued. Due to the shelling of the occupiers, we were unable to rescue people from Borodyanka, Kyiv region. But we will not abandon these attempts. Ukrainians were evacuated from Bervytsya, Bucha, and Bohdanivka to Brovary. People were taken to Bakhmut from Lysychansk, Popasna, Severodonetsk, and Rubizhne in the Luhansk region. More than 4000 Mariupol residents managed to leave for Zaporizhzhia. Unfortunately, it was not possible to deliver the humanitarian cargo to the cities of the Kherson region. Russian troops blocked the movement of our convoy. Why? Their goal has not changed - in the same way they try to portray in their propaganda that Ukraine has left its citizens without the essentials. As if Russia is constantly saving them from something. Although on February 23 our Kherson residents had more than the regions of Russia itself. I spoke today with French President Macron. About our interaction. About finding a solution for peace, for the liberation of our territories. To save our people. I am sure you understand that negotiations are not easy and pleasant. But they are needed. Because it's about life. Ukraine has always sought a peaceful solution. The more we are interested in peace now. Because we count everyone killed. Because every ruined family, every ruined house matters to us. Because we are Ukrainians, and for us a person is priceless. Today I signed a decree on awarding 161 of our defenders with state awards of Ukraine. 40 of them posthumously. And the decree on awarding the title of Hero of Ukraine to 12 servicemen. 8 of them posthumously. I also met with warriors of the special unit of the National Police of Ukraine KORD to award them. I thanked them for their service, for the protection of our peaceful cities and for their help to the army. In total, during the days of the full-scale war, 70 of our defenders have already been awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. 2180 Ukrainians were awarded orders and medals for courage, for saving brothers-in-arms and civilians, for effective actions in defense of the state. I am sure I can say on behalf of all our Ukrainian people: we are sincerely grateful to each of you. To each and everyone who defends our state and stops the army of occupiers, which was called one of the few most powerful in the world. Ukrainian poet Lina Kostenko celebrates her birthday on March 19. I sincerely congratulate you. On behalf of all Ukrainians. And let me remind you today her words: [Quotes Lina Kostenko's poem] In fact, each of us has a nation. And we should not think meanly. Especially those whom Ukrainians have given the right to be politicians. I want to remind all politicians from any camp: wartime shows very well the meanness of personal ambitions of those who try to put their own ambitions, their own party or career above the interests of the state, the interests of the people. Those who hide somewhere in the rear, but pretend to be the only one who cares about defense. Any activity of politicians aimed at splitting or collaborating will not succeed. But it will get a tough response. That is why the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine decided… Given the full-scale war waged by the Russian Federation and the ties of some political structures with this state, any activity of a number of political parties during the martial law is suspended. Namely: ""Opposition Platform - For Life"", ""Shariy Party"", ""Nashi"", ""Opposition Bloc"", ""Left Opposition"", ""Union of Left Forces"", ""State"", ""Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine"", ""Socialist Party of Ukraine”, “Socialists” Party, “Volodymyr Saldo Bloc”. The Ministry of Justice is instructed to immediately take comprehensive measures to ban the activities of these political parties in the prescribed manner. Everyone must now take care of the interests of our state, the interests of Ukraine. Because it's for us. Because it is for the sake of life. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine"
The First Lady of Ukraine addressed the World Council of Churches,2022-03-19T18:40:00Z,"The First Lady of Ukraine Olena Zelenska addressed the World Council of Churches with a request to become a mediator in the organization of humanitarian corridors and to help Ukrainians fleeing the war. ""I appeal to you as to an organization called to preach peace and fraternity: be the voice of those who suffer from war today! Communicate to the members of the World Council of Churches the importance of professing justice and peace on our land based on faith in God. I ask you and the members of the World Council of Churches to convey your voice condemning the war and calling for the protection of the civilian population,"" the wife of the President of Ukraine noted. Since the beginning of the war, Olena Zelenska has been working on humanitarian support for Ukrainians. In particular, she actively cooperates with international organizations, the first ladies of other countries to resolve humanitarian crises in Ukraine. Now she is focused on providing the necessary assistance to children and mothers and saving their lives. That is why Olena Zelenska appealed to the World Council of Churches to help Ukraine."
Address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the people of Switzerland,2022-03-19T18:29:00Z,"Dear Mr. President, dear Ignazio! My greetings to all Swiss friends of Ukraine! To all your beautiful people, the people of Switzerland! I am grateful to you for supporting our people. Thank you for defending freedom together with all those who value it. This is very important now. Nowadays. At a special time period. And especially important - from you. When terror became the national idea of one of the largest nations in the world. The basis of their foreign policy. When the crimes of terrorism are committed not by some outcast or group of persons and not by an organization, but by the state. Which has a nuclear arsenal. When a permanent member of the UN Security Council deliberately destroys everything for which the UN was built. Having unleashed a cruel, bloody, senseless war against us. But we now have a chance. A chance to show not only to Russia, but also to any aggressor in the world, any terrorist state, that war will destroy not the victim, but the one who came with it. And, perhaps, this is the last chance for humanity - to stop the wars. Stop the state terror. And I'm telling you now. Switzerland. A state that has a very long history of peace. And an even longer history of influence. In many areas - a decisive influence on the world. Even before I became President, I was thinking what life of our beloved Ukrainians I would like to see. I have often been to your country. And I know very well how you live. And one day, standing near Chillon Castle, I asked my friends - we were one company - why can't we live like this? To have such a standard of living. A high level. And with the same freedom. In such friendly communities. And with such confidence in our own strength. And I sincerely wanted the Ukrainians to live like the Swiss. So that we can jointly decide everything about our own lives. About our land. Not expecting anything from politicians, unnecessary words, but voting in a referendum. So that we can be sure, despite all the financial crises in the world, that our state will withstand and remain a leader. A leader of trust, a leader of stability. A dream for all people. Successful, not very successful - no matter what level, just for all people. So that the Ukrainians, like the Swiss, can feel that they live in real communities that care about what is common to all - for the good of all. Maybe these are all ordinary things to you. For us, these are reforms. And this is the path we are taking and we wanted to take. And we passed the relevant laws. For all this to work. We gave opportunities. Opportunities for our people. So that we gradually reach your standard of living. And we did it until the black day. February 24. The day of the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion of our land, Ukraine. And then everything changed. It has changed for each of us, Ukrainians. I'm sure it has changed for all Europeans. And it has changed for all world democracies. It has changed for you, too. I am grateful to you and your state for supporting us in such a difficult time. I am thankful that you did not stay away, didn't say that it wasn't related to you at all Because, in fact, it is impossible to stay away from the fact that in the 21st century, in the heart of Europe, hundreds of rockets and bombs are flying at peaceful cities. It is impossible to stay away when the army of the world's largest state, albeit only in size, directs all its deadly potential to destroy us, to destroy hospitals, ordinary schools, churches, universities, maternity hospitals, residential areas. It is impossible to be indifferent when children are killed. As of this morning, the Russian army has killed 112 Ukrainian children. And just as I wanted the Ukrainians to live like the Swiss... I also want you to be and become like the Ukrainians. In the fight against evil. So that there is no question about banks. About your banks. Where the money of all those who started this war is kept. It's painful and it's hard. But it is also a struggle against evil. It is necessary to completely freeze all the assets of these people and their accounts. It's a big fight, and you can do it. I want you to become Ukrainians who feel what it is like when whole cities are destroyed, peaceful cities. Destroyed on the orders of those who like to live in communities - different, European, in your communities, in beautiful Swiss communities. Who enjoys real estate in your country. And it would be fair to deprive them of this privilege. To deprive of what they are taking from us. And I want you to be as Ukrainians in the issue of business. Business that works in Russia in spite of everything. Despite this war. Despite all our murdered children. Despite the people killed. Despite the destroyed cities. Like our city of Mariupol, heroic Mariupol, which has been under complete blockade for weeks. Imagine - no food, no water, no electricity. Just under the bombs. ""Good food. Good life."" This is the slogan of Nestlé. Your company that refuses to leave Russia. Even now - when there are threats from Russia to other European countries. Not only to us. When there is even nuclear blackmail from Russia. And I want all of you, Swiss people, to become like all of us, Ukrainians. I want us not to lose our common chance now. A chance to restore peace, a chance to stop any wars in the world. Because when Switzerland is with you, you are definitely successful. Because when Ukraine is with you, you are definitely strong. Last year we agreed on a big conference with the President of your country. Conference in Lugano. For the sake of economic transformation, for the sake of Ukraine's reforms. It was to take place this July. As well as the next summit of the first ladies and gentlemen. And I believe, I know we can hold them. This year. On your land. For the restoration and development of Ukraine. So that you have the opportunity to show again and again all the best that is in your hearts. In our hearts. In the hearts of all those people who are fighting for freedom and fighting for life. I am grateful to you. I am grateful to Switzerland! Glory to Ukraine!"

The route of the convoy: Bervytsya - Mokrets - Zavorychi - Kalyta - Semypolky - Litky - Rozhny - Pukhivka - Zazymya - Brovary. ""Residents of settlements, please be attentive.

Meaningful talks on peace and security for Ukraine are the only chance for Russia to reduce the damage from its own mistakes - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-03-19T01:13:00Z,"Good evening to everyone. Usually on such days we used to say: “Spring has come”.  But now we are saying: “War has come”. But we will definitely defeat everyone no matter what. Because we are free people of a free country. Today, government officials have elaborated the decision to fully reboot the customs service. Cargo for our defense, for our people will be brought into Ukraine as easily as the physics laws allow that.  We eliminate the whole bureaucracy, all paperwork, VAT, all customs duties.  The goal is clear - to prevent the human factor from hindering the speedy supply of goods, which are really needed now.  Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Ruslan Stefanchuk and profile committees are working to ensure the support of people's deputies for the innovations. I emphasize: this decision is necessary for the defense of the state, for ensuring normal life during martial law.  I urge certain MPs not to speculate on this issue, as it is for the benefit of our state, not the government or the opposition. We must all work jointly for the sake of our Ukraine, our people. Let’s think about PR after the victory.  Another important area of government work is helping Ukrainians who have been forced to flee their homes due to hostilities. I commissioned the Cabinet of Ministers to develop a comprehensive program to support such people, our citizens. Everyone who was deprived of home because of the war. We already have the outlines of this program. The first component is financial. State support for all displaced persons. Adults and children. Government support for jobs for such people - where they are temporarily staying. So that every person, every family has a basis for life. The second component is housing. The government is preparing concrete proposals for housing for IDPs right now. And also organizes the reconstruction of destroyed housing after the war. The third component is no less important. This is the support for the families who have housed people from areas of hostilities or temporary occupation. At a minimum, they will be reimbursed for the cost of utilities related to the stay of IDPs. Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal will soon explain all the details of such a comprehensive program to support our citizens. A coordination headquarters has been set up to regulate all issues related to the delivery of humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Under the chairmanship of Head of the Office of the President Andriy Yermak, a meeting was held with Ukrainian ambassadors to intensify the supply of humanitarian goods to Ukraine, primarily to help internally displaced persons. I also commissioned the government to provide assistance together with the International Committee of the Red Cross to those of our citizens who found themselves abroad after February 24 and need the attention of our state and international organizations. Today there were seven humanitarian corridors in Ukraine. Six - in the Sumy region, one - in the Donetsk region. More than 9,000 people were evacuated from the besieged Mariupol. In total, more than 180,000 Ukrainians have been rescued by the humanitarian corridors. Hundreds of tons of essential products were delivered. But the occupiers continue to block the supply of humanitarian aid to the besieged cities in most areas. This is a totally deliberate tactic. They have a clear order to do absolutely everything to make the humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities an ""argument"" for Ukrainians to cooperate with the occupiers. This is a war crime. They will be held accountable for this. 100%. Every Russian figure who gives such orders and every Russian soldier who carries out such orders will be identified. And will receive a compulsory one-way ticket to The Hague. To the city where the International Criminal Court is located. People are being rescued from the rubble of the drama theater destroyed by the occupiers in Mariupol, where civilians had been hiding from Russian shelling and bombs. More than 130 people are already on the surface. Some of them are seriously wounded. But at the moment there is no information about the dead. Thanks to the courage and professional training of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the occupation forces were stopped in almost all directions. Heavy fighting in the Kharkiv region - especially heavy near Izyum. Russian troops have already thrown people from training centers there. Absolutely unprepared contingent. People who can't endure half an hour in battle. Kyiv region, Sumy region, Chernihiv region, the south of our state - the army stopped the occupiers. The initial plan of the Russian military to seize our state failed. And it seems that they do not know what else can be done to us. It seems that their military commanders are not able to offer their political leadership anything but cruel and erroneous tactics to exhaust us, to exhaust Ukraine. Nothing but constant strikes at the civilian population, peaceful cities, people, children, missiles, air bombs, shelling from ""Grads"", ""Uragans"". Nothing but the destruction of non-military infrastructure - residential buildings, hospitals, schools, churches. But this tactic of their military only worsens the situation for the Russian state. Leads to new and new destructive sanctions. Encourages new members to join our anti-war coalition. It allows us to unite even those states that have always tried to remain neutral to put pressure on Russia. Therefore, negotiations on peace, on security for us, for Ukraine - meaningful, fair and without delay - are the only chance for Russia to reduce the damage from its own mistakes. We have always insisted on negotiations. We have always offered dialogue, offered solutions for peace. Not only during 23 days of invasion. And I want everyone to hear me now, especially in Moscow. It's time to meet. Time to talk. It is time to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine. Otherwise, Russia's losses will be so huge that several generations will not be enough to rebound. Many words were heard in Moscow today in connection with the anniversary of the seizure of Crimea. A big rally took place. And I want to pay attention to one detail. It is reported that a total of about 200,000 people were involved in the rally in the Russian capital. 100,000 on the streets, about 95,000 at the stadium. Approximately the same number of Russian troops were involved in the invasion of Ukraine. Just imagine 14 thousand corpses and tens of thousands of wounded and maimed people at that stadium in Moscow. There are already so many Russian losses as a result of this invasion. This is the price of war. In a little more than three weeks. The war must end. Ukraine's proposals are on the table. In the coming days, I will continue to appeal to the nations of the world to call for peace for Ukraine. My appeal to the Swiss people is ahead, to the people and to the state. Appeals to Israel, Italy and Japan are also planned. The world hears Ukraine's position. The world supports our defenders, defenders of Ukraine. Today I want to express my sincere gratitude to each defender of our strong Mariupol. Our heroic city, which is experiencing the greatest ordeal in its history, in the history of Ukraine. 36th Separate Marine Brigade. 501st Separate Marine Battalion. 1st Separate Marine Battalion. 12th Brigade of the National Guard. And a separate detachment of special purpose ""Azov"". I am grateful to each and every one of our defenders of Mariupol. I am grateful to everyone who defends Ukraine. Also at the request of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine I decided to confer the title of Hero of Ukraine upon: Colonel Baranyuk Volodymyr Anatoliyovych, Commander of the 36th Separate Marine Brigade. And Major Prokopenko Denys Hennadiyovych, Commander of a separate detachment of special purpose ""Azov"". For courage, for effective actions to repel enemy attacks, for the defense of the hero city of Mariupol. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"
"By attacking Ukraine, Russia will destroy everything it has achieved over the past 25 years - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-03-18T15:35:00Z,"Strong people of the indomitable country! The 23rd day of our patriotic war continues. After eight years of war in the east. The occupiers do not stop burning their national wealth in the war against Ukraine. I am confident that by attacking us, they will destroy everything that Russian society has achieved over the past 25 years. And they will return to where they once began to rise from, as they say, to the ""the wicked 90's"". But without freedom, without the creative desire of millions of people to work for the development of their state. This will be the price of war against Ukraine for Russia. It will be a fall for them, a painful fall. And they will feel it even in spite of the ""opium for the people"" from television propagandists. Unjust and aggressive war always has a high price for the aggressor. But no matter what happens to them, it cannot comfort us. It will not resurrect our dead people. It will not restore our cities. It will not heal the emotional wound that will stay with us forever. We will rebuild everything - I have no doubt about that. We will become a full member of the EU - each representative of our state works for this 24/7. But life will be different, and for many - without the thousands of hearts stopped by this war. May the memory of everyone who gave life for Ukraine live forever! Russian troops have continued treacherous shelling of our peaceful cities and our communities. Lviv, Kyiv and the region, Zhytomyr region, Sumy region, Kharkiv and the region, Chernihiv, cities of Donbas - Severodonetsk, Kramatorsk, our Mariupol... Missile strikes, air bombs, ""Grads"". We are shooting down Russian missiles as much as we can. We are destroying their planes and helicopters. And this despite the fact that we do not yet have adequate anti-missile weapons. Advanced weapons. We do not have enough combat aircraft. But we have a goal, pure and fair - to protect our people, our state. Undoubtedly, we will continue to do everything we can. We will remind some Western leaders even louder that this will be a moral defeat for them, it will destroy their prestige if Ukraine does not receive advanced weapons that will really save the lives of thousands of our people. Russian missiles will not fall from shotguns, which some are trying to replace really useful supplies with. Today is a busy day of negotiations for me. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission. Charles Michel, President of the European Council. Ukraine's great friend, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Johnson. The subject is clear. First, these are concrete steps that will give Ukraine even more strength, not only directly for the defense, but also for the economy. For our people, for Ukrainians who really defend Europe. Here and now. On our land. President Ursula von der Leyen has promised to do everything possible to speed up Ukraine's accession to the EU. We reduce bureaucratic processes for our state, which usually take years, to weeks, to months. It's not easy, but we do it. I am sure. We also agreed on the EU's support for Ukrainians who were forced to flee their homes due to the war. For those who are abroad and within our state. We agreed on a new macro-financial aid - another 300 million euros for Ukraine. In addition to those on which a decision has already been made. Secondly, we are discussing the next package of sanctions against Russia. Significant enough. To make them feel that every missile against our state, every bomb, every shot has its price. For the Russian budget, for Russian companies, for Russian ambitions and for specific people who represent the Russian government. And until there is peace for Ukraine, sanctions against Russia must grow steadily. I am grateful to all public initiatives from around the world that offer restrictions for Russia not only at the state level, but also at the level of societies. In particular, I am grateful to the Swedish Port Workers' Union, which promises not to service vessels connected with Russia. This is right. This is a good example for all public structures, all trade unions and business associations to follow. If Russia is not stopped now, if Russia is not punished now, other aggressors in the world will start other wars. In different regions of the world. On different continents. Wherever a state dreams of conquering its neighbors. We need to act now so that all other potential aggressors see that war is only a loss and no benefit. That is why it is necessary for all Europeans to block ports for all Russian ships. So that all Russian commercial vessels follow the Russian warship. It is necessary that all Western companies leave the Russian market and not cover with cheap PR their thirst for profit despite blood, despite war crimes. Like Nestle or Auchan for example. To date, humanitarian corridors in the Sumy, Donetsk and Kharkiv regions have been agreed upon. Sumy, Konotop, Trostyanets, Lebedyn, Krasnopillya, Velyka Pysarivka. It is especially difficult from the besieged Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia. The occupiers are doing everything to complicate the movement of people and prevent Ukrainian humanitarian cargo from entering the city. This is outright terror. But we try, we do our best. More than 35,000 people have already been rescued from Mariupol. Rescue work is underway at the site of the bombing by the occupiers of the theater where Mariupol residents hid from shelling, used it as a shelter. It is known that as of now, more than 130 people were rescued. But hundreds of Mariupol residents are still under the debris. Despite the shelling, despite all the difficulties, we will continue rescue work. The situation in the Kharkiv region is very difficult. The occupiers do not stop trying to destroy our city of Izyum. People in Balakliya are being tortured. Our team is doing everything to organize a working humanitarian corridor to these cities and deliver food, water and medicine. I instructed the Cabinet of Ministers, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council and the Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada to develop a format of decisions that will speed up the supply of all necessary goods from abroad. This is especially topical for food, fuel and other goods that meet the basic needs of society. War is not a time for bureaucrats and careerists from different departments to complicate the provision of goods for people. We want to simplify the passage of goods that Ukrainians need now through customs as much as possible. If this requires the removal of taxes and excises during martial law, we are ready to do so. If it is necessary to remove customs officers who do not understand the tasks of wartime to act quickly, we will do so. Our borders must be open to everything Ukrainians need. I am waiting for the appropriate decisions by the end of the day. And then - the support from people's deputies. Because now everyone has to work only for Ukrainians, only for our state, for defense. Not for ambitions. Not for fear. Not for bureaucracy. Everything is for the protection of Ukraine! Today I signed a decree on the awarding of state awards to 138 servicemen of the Armed Forces. In particular, the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky of the II degree is awarded to: Syrskyi Oleksandr Stanislavovych, Commander of the Land Forces. Since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion, he has been leading the defense of Kyiv. Thanks to his professional and courageous actions, the enemy suffered significant losses and was driven away from the capital. During the defense of Kyiv, more than 30 settlements in the Kyiv region, which were temporarily occupied by the enemy, were liberated. Major Mazurok Taras Leonidovych, commander of the tank battalion. Defending the Donetsk region, he inflicted significant losses on the enemy and significantly stopped his advance. Sergeant Nutsa Ruslana Vasylivna was awarded the Order of Courage of the III degree. Senior combat medic. She personally took part in the evacuation of the wounded from Vodyane, Shyrokyne and Mariupol. Thanks to her actions, 31 of our defenders were saved. She continues to perform tasks in Mariupol. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"
"As of March 18, nine humanitarian corridors have been agreed upon, and a hotline for information on war prisoners and missing persons has been launched - Iryna Vereshchuk",2022-03-18T10:09:00Z,"As of March 18, nine humanitarian corridors have been agreed upon in Ukraine to evacuate people from settlements affected by shelling by Russian troops. This was announced by Deputy Prime Minister - Minister for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories Iryna Vereshchuk. Thus, evacuation from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia is planned in the Donetsk region. ""A convoy of buses with a fuel truck continued to move from Vasylivka. After 9 am the second column of buses with Mariupol residents who managed to escape from the city will be transported from Berdyansk to Zaporizhzhia. Those who, unfortunately, go on foot, will be assisted in the city of Manhush,"" she said. In the Sumy region, humanitarian corridors have been coordinated from the cities of Sumy, Trostyanets, Lebedyn and Konotop, as well as from the villages of Krasnopillya and Velyka Pysarivka to Poltava. In the Kharkiv region, humanitarian aid is planned to be delivered to the cities of Balakliya and Izyum. For Tomorrow, March 19, routes of humanitarian aid to the cities of the Kherson and Luhansk regions are being worked out. Iryna Vereshchuk reminded the phone numbers of the National Information Bureau: 1648 and (044) 287-81-65. ""This hotline is designed for the initial collection of information and communication with victims. The line will also function in messengers. I ask those who have questions and who want information about the dead, missing, prisoners of war, illegally detained by Russia, including civilians to call and we will help,"" said the Deputy Prime Minister."
Our tactics is when the enemy does not know what to expect from us - address by the President of Ukraine,2022-03-18T00:52:00Z,"Great people of a great country! The 22nd day of our struggle, our defense against one of the world's largest armies is over. Which we make smaller every day. Every day. But it still has numbers, equipment and reserves. We have information that the Russian military is recruiting mercenaries from other countries, trying to deceive as many young people as possible into military service. We know that this will not help them. So now I warn everyone who will try to join the occupiers on our Ukrainian land. This will be the worst decision of your life. Long life is better than the money you are offered for a short one. Our courageous defenders continue to hold all the key areas that the enemy is pressing. And respond to every attack. To every blow of the occupiers to our peaceful cities, to our people. New Russian conscripts have been taken prisoner. Among them are those who refuse to return to Russia. And there are many who are not even mentioned in Russia. They don't even try to take them back. Their death notifications have been sent to their families although they are in captivity and alive. All Russians who can hear me now, speak about it. Tell it in Russia. Every mother who knows that her son was sent to war against Ukraine must check where her son is. And especially those who cannot contact their children, who have been told that their children had been killed. And who didn't receive the bodies. There are phone numbers on the Internet that you can call and find out what is really happening to your children. We did not plan to take thousands of prisoners. We do not need 13 or any number of thousands of dead Russian soldiers. We do not need it. We didn't want this war. We only want peace. And we want you to love your children more than you fear your authorities. I addressed the parliament of Germany today. One of the most influential countries in the world. In Europe. One of the natural leaders of the European continent. I spoke not just as President, but as a Ukrainian citizen. As a European. As someone who has felt for many years that the German state seems to have fenced itself off us with a wall. Invisible yet solid wall. We have seen Germany fight for the economy for decades. For new Russian gas pipelines and old European dreams. Dreams of some kind of cooperation that Russia has not taken seriously for a long time. We see that the views of the Germans are changing. And this is very important. We see Germany looking for a new path. We see how sincerely the majority of Germans stand in favor of revising the old policy. We see that Chancellor Olaf Scholz has a great chance, a great mission - to give Germany a renewed leadership. Give Europe peace. Long-lasting and most importantly - fair. One that guarantees security to every state in Europe and Ukraine in the first place. And I sincerely wish Chancellor Scholz from all Ukrainians, from all Europeans that Germany and its partners succeed in carrying out this mission. I will continue such speeches in the parliaments and squares of the partner states. Necessarily. As much as it takes to stop the war. To restore our territorial integrity. To return to all of us, Ukrainians and all Europeans, the long-awaited peace. I feel that we are being increasingly understood. In Europe, in the world, in different countries. And it gives us more and more support. The one we have been asking for for so long. I spoke with French President Macron. We are strengthening the defense of Ukraine. We coordinated our joint steps towards peace. I'm grateful for that. I am also grateful to President Biden for his new and effective support for our country. Please, understand: I can't reveal all the details of this support package and others to you. Because this is our tactic. Our defense. When the enemy does not know what to expect from us. Just as they did not know what would await them after February 24. Didn't know what we had for the defense and how we were preparing to face the attack. The occupiers thought they were going to Ukraine, which they had seen before, in 2014-2015. Which they constantly corrupted and which they were not afraid of. But we are different. And this allows us to defend ourselves against a full-scale strike for 22 days already. Everything we have done in a few years. For our defense. For our tactics. For defense tactics, which is not the time to reveal while the war is going on. It is not the time to reveal our tactics of negotiations as well. Negotiations for peace, sovereignty, territorial integrity of our state, our freedom. Working more in silence than on television, radio or Facebook. I think this is right. Today I visited the wonderful Vlasenko family from Vorzel, Kyiv region, at the hospital. Escaping, they got under Russian shelling. The eldest daughter, Katya, who is only 16 years old, covered her brother Ihor, who is 8. The brother got out of the car and cursed the occupiers. Tetiana, mother, received shrapnel wounds. The father carried his daughter in his arms. Thank God they all survived. Because they stayed together, as a family, and defended each other. I was really moved to talk to them. Probably the most during this war. I sincerely wish health and happiness to this family, the Vlasenko family. Like all other families. I wish you peace and work for it. Also today, I awarded five employees of the State Emergency Service with the Order of Courage. Everyone is a hero. Everyone was awarded for selfless actions, for dedication with which they save all of us, save Ukrainians. And some more news, very important and, of course, positive. About our economy. About how we bring our country back to life. Right now, wherever security allows. Wherever business can run. Our government has already prepared a decision to expand the lending program for entrepreneurs on the basis of the program ""5-7-9%"" creating a new opportunity. Any business will be able to get a loan at 0%. For the time of martial law plus 1 month after the war. Then there will be a minimum rate of 5%. And the total loan amount can be up to 60 million hryvnias. So that a wider range of businesses can take advantage of our program. The second news is that the Cabinet of Ministers will vote tomorrow for a large-scale reduction of regulations. There were more than 600 permits and licenses for business, and about 20 remain mandatory. Only those that simply cannot be revoked. For example, radioactive waste management. So, for the vast majority of businesses in Ukraine, the declarative principle will work: you have announced the start of business and you work freely. And the third news, which concerns millions of Ukrainians. This is a special task for the National Bank of Ukraine, for people's deputies and our government officials. I instructed to find such a legislative opportunity for the state to guarantee 100% of deposits in Ukrainian banks. 100%. Not part, as now, as always, but 100%. The whole deposit. In any bank of our state. So that people do not lose money and are not afraid of it under any circumstances. So I'm waiting for specifics. Draft decision. And I hope that the Verkhovna Rada will not delay the support. Because Ukrainians need it. Ukraine needs this. And finally. Our Mariupol, our Kharkiv, our Chernihiv, Kyiv region, Izyum and all our hero cities. Which are in a very difficult situation. Extremely difficult. We are doing everything. All of us. Absolutely. Our army, police, SES, humanitarian convoys, church... All our people. We will not leave you. And we will not forgive them. You will be free. Definitely. I know it. Like all of us on our land. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"
"During the online meeting, Andriy Yermak called on the world's leading investment companies to participate in the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war",2022-03-17T19:13:00Z,"Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak held an online conference with representatives of the world's leading investment companies. He said that the Russian army continues to bomb Ukrainian cities, killing civilians and children. ""Today the whole world is talking about the terrible situation in Mariupol. The situation is not much better in Kharkiv, in the settlements around Kyiv. But Ukraine will never give up, will never give up its independence. And the army of a non-NATO country has stopped and continues to fight one of the largest armies in the world,"" Andriy Yermak stressed. According to him, negotiations with the Russian Federation to end the war are not easy, and it is very difficult to predict everything that the parties may eventually agree on. But there is definitely no compromise for Ukraine regarding its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Head of the President's Office is convinced that Russia's war against Ukraine has destroyed the structure of not only European, but also world security, and we need to build a new one, where our state will have one of the key positions. Andriy Yermak also noted that after the end of the war, Ukrainians will rebuild their beautiful country very quickly. To this end, Ukraine plans to raise funds from international partners, as well as reparations to be paid by the Russian Federation. He called on businesses to invest in the purchase of military bonds of the Ukrainian government, and responsible companies that have already left or are leaving Russia - to refocus on Ukraine in the future. Also, according to the Head of the Office of the President, it would be appropriate to consider the creation of special funds or individual programs for the restoration and reconstruction of Ukraine. ""The best answer to the inhumane acts we see now in our country will be the appearance of the most modern buildings and enterprises on the site of destroyed buildings, where Ukrainians will be able to work. And we hope that thanks to this, people who are now forced to leave Ukraine will quickly return to their homeland,"" Andriy Yermak summed up."
President paid a visit to the hospital with residents of the Kyiv region wounded by enemy shelling,2022-03-17T17:05:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy paid a visit to the Vlasenko family, which got under the shelling by the occupiers during the evacuation from the town of Vorzel, Kyiv region. The Vlasenko family moved to the Kyiv region from Crimea after the beginning of the Russian occupation of the peninsula, as they did not want to acquire Russian citizenship. When Russia started a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the family decided to leave Vorzel for a safer place, but the car got under enemy fire. Then the eldest 16-year-old daughter Katya covered her younger 8-year-old brother Ihor with her body and received significant wounds. Seeing his sister bleeding, Ihor got out of the car and started shouting at the occupiers for what they had done. Mother Tetiana also suffered shrapnel wounds. Father Roman carried the wounded daughter in his arms to help her. The mother and daughter will undergo treatment for several months, but they managed to save their family and survive. During a meeting with the Vlasenko family at the hospital, Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted their solidarity, care and willingness to protect each other to the end, which saved their lives. The President wished the Vlasenko family a speedy recovery and expressed confidence that they would all soon celebrate Ukraine's victory together. ""It cannot be otherwise when there are such strong families in our country,"" the President said. He presented a tablet for learning, flowers, sweets and fruits to the Vlasenko family. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also presented a toy to little Ihor, as the shelling hit the yard of the family house and the boy's toys were damaged by shrapnel. At the hospital, the President of Ukraine also spoke with other Kyiv residents undergoing treatment, a territorial defense fighter and the driver of the documentary journalist Brent Renaud who was killed in Irpin."
Ukraine needs effective security guarantees that will work unconditionally - Mykhailo Podolyak,2022-03-17T16:13:00Z,"Immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of Ukraine are among the key aspects of a peace agreement that could be signed as a result of negotiations with Russia to end the war against Ukraine. But strategically, our state wants to have a concrete mechanism that will guarantee its security in the future. This was stated by Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Mykhailo Podolyak in an interview for WP Wiadomości. ""Immediate ceasefire and immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine is one of the key aspects of the peace agreement. There is no other way. However, the negotiations are a large-scale process in which not only Russia and Ukraine are involved. Our partners also take an indirect part. Because we don't just have to sign a treaty. We want to develop a concrete mechanism that will guarantee our security in the future,"" he said. Mykhailo Podolyak noted that the Ukrainian and Russian delegations are still defending their positions at the talks, so it may take some time to agree on the disputed issues. Unfortunately, the process is not as fast as we would like it to be. ""During this time, we must move closer to a peace agreement. First of all, taking into account the interests of Ukraine, which has suffered enormous destruction by the Russian Federation,"" he stressed. The Adviser to the Head of the President's Office is convinced that after the signing of such an agreement, Russia will have no choice but to begin the immediate withdrawal of its armed forces from Ukraine. ""After the signing of the treaty, the Vienna Convention will enter into force for both parties. It makes it clear that a peace treaty can be annulled if the belligerent states do not withdraw their troops from the enemy's territory. Therefore, any attempts to keep Russian soldiers on Ukrainian land will be legally groundless,"" he explained. Mykhailo Podoyak noted that in order to prevent Russia’s another violation of international law and treaties, Ukraine wants to spell out in detail a specific plan for the withdrawal of Russian troops, legally verify it and gain the support of international partners. ""Besides, it is foreign states that will guarantee the fulfillment of conditions and Ukraine’s security in the future. This will be a document that describes in detail the procedure in case of repeated aggression by Russia. This is an innovative formula authored by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which can become the basis for creating a completely new security system in Europe,"" said the Adviser to the Head of the President's Office. In his opinion, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has shown that the entire architecture of European security must be revised. That is why our state wants to end this war with a new coalition, so powerful that it will stop Russia if it wants to attack someone again. Theoretically, now is the time to speak publicly about all aspects of modern challenges and openly assess the level of modern security contours. Do they cope with these challenges? Can they protect European cities from the barbaric bombings that Ukraine is experiencing today? Will Europe be able to finally get rid of the fear of the Russian Federation? It is obvious that the countries that will be the new guarantors of security will undertake certain commitments. ""In the future, on the basis of today's global crisis, a completely new alliance will be created, which will ensure the security of the whole of Europe,"" Mykhailo Podolyak stressed. The Adviser to the Head of the President's Office stated that Ukraine would not agree to compromises that could damage its interests in any way. And it is not for the sake of such compromises that Ukrainians are now dying on the battlefields willing to fight to the end. ""We are not Russia. We know how and will continue to have a dialogue with our society. And we always hear our society. Unlike Russia, we can discuss any issues that should have been discussed long ago, but we will not agree to any ultimatum,"" he said. Mykhailo Podolyak noted that despite the complexity of this process, Ukraine must hold negotiations with Russia, as no one else wants to fight together with our state. We just have to understand that negotiations during the war are just another frontline."
Address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the Bundestag,2022-03-17T12:02:00Z,"Dear President Göring-Eckardt. Dear Mr. Scholz. Dear ladies and gentlemen, deputies, guests, journalists. German people! I am addressing you after three weeks of full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, after eight years of war in the east of my country, in Donbas. I appeal to you when Russia is bombing our cities, destroying everything in Ukraine. Everything - houses, hospitals, schools, churches. Using missiles, air bombs, rocket artillery. Thousands of Ukrainians died in three weeks. The occupiers killed 108 children. In the middle of Europe, in our country, in 2022. I am addressing you after numerous meetings, negotiations, statements and requests. After steps in support, some of which are overdue. After sanctions, which are obviously not enough to stop this war. And after we saw how many ties your companies still have with Russia. With a state that just uses you and some other countries to finance the war. During the three weeks of war for our lives, for our freedom, we became convinced of what we had felt before. And what you probably do not all notice yet. You are like behind the wall again. Not the Berlin Wall. But in the middle of Europe. Between freedom and slavery. And this wall grows stronger with each bomb that falls on our land, on Ukraine. With every decision that is not made for the sake of peace. Not approved by you, although it may help. When did it happen? Dear politicians. Dear German people. Why is this possible? When we told you that Nord Stream was a weapon and a preparation for a great war, we heard in response that it was an economy after all. Economy. Economy. But it was cement for a new wall. When we asked you what Ukraine needs to do to become a member of NATO, to be safe, to receive security guarantees, we heard the answer: such a decision is not on the table yet and will not be in the near future. Just as the chair for us at this table. Just as you are still delaying the issue of Ukraine's accession to the European Union. Frankly, for some it is politics. The truth is that it is stones. Stones for a new wall. When we asked for preventive sanctions, we appealed to Europe, we appealed to many countries. We turned to you. Sanctions for the aggressor to feel that you are a force. We saw delays. We felt resistance. We understood that you want to continue the economy. Economy. Economy. And now the trade routes between you and the country that has once again brought a brutal war to Europe are barbed wire over the wall. Over the new wall that divides Europe. And you don't see what's behind this wall, and it's between us, between people in Europe. And because of this, not everyone is fully aware of what we are going through today. I am addressing you on behalf of Ukrainians, I am addressing you on behalf of Mariupol residents - civilians of a city that Russian troops have blocked and razed to the ground. They just destroy everything there. Everything and everyone who is there. Hundreds of thousands of people are under shelling around the clock. No food, 24 hours a day without water, no electricity, 24 hours a day without communication. For weeks. Russian troops do not distinguish between civilians and military. They don't care where civilian objects are, everything is considered a target. A theater that was a shelter for hundreds of people and was blown up yesterday, a maternity hospital, a children's hospital, residential areas without any military facilities - they are destroying everything. Round the clock. And they do not let any humanitarian cargo into our blocked city. For five days, Russian troops have not stopped the shelling specifically to prevent the rescue of our people. You can see it all. If you climb over this Wall. If you remember what the Berlin Airlift meant to you. Which could be realized because the sky was safe. You were not killed from the sky as now in our country, when we cannot even make an airlift! When the sky gives only Russian missiles and air bombs. I am addressing you on behalf of older Ukrainians. Many survivors of World War II. Those who escaped during the occupation 80 years ago. Those who survived Babyn Yar. Babyn Yar that President Steinmeier visited last year. On the 80th anniversary of the tragedy. And that was hit by Russian missiles now. It is exactly this place that was hit. And the missile strike killed the family that went to Babyn Yar, to the monument. Killed again, 80 years after. I appeal to you on behalf of everyone who has heard politicians say: ""Never again."" And who saw that these words are worthless. Because again in Europe they are trying to destroy the whole nation. Destroy everything we live by and live for. I am addressing you on behalf of our military. Those who defend our state, and therefore the values that are often talked about everywhere in Europe, everywhere - and in Germany as well. Freedom and equality. Opportunity to live freely, not to submit to another state, which considers a foreign land its ""living space"". Why are they defending all this without your leadership? Without your strength? Why are overseas states closer to us than you are? Because this is the Wall. The wall that someone doesn't notice and that we are hammering on while fighting to save our people. Ladies and Gentlemen! German people! I am grateful to everyone who supports us. I am grateful to you. Ordinary Germans who sincerely help Ukrainians on your land. To journalists who do their job honestly, showing all the evil that Russia has brought to us. I am grateful to the German businessmen who put morality and humanity above accounting. Above the economy. Economy. Economy. And I am grateful to the politicians who are still trying... Trying to break this Wall. Who choose life between Russian money and the deaths of Ukrainian children. Who support the strengthening of sanctions against Russia that can guarantee peace. Peace to Ukraine. Peace to Europe. Who do not hesitate to disconnect Russia from SWIFT. Who know that an embargo on trade with Russia is needed. On imports of everything that sponsors this war. Who know that Ukraine will be in the European Union. Because Ukraine is already more Europe than many others. I am grateful to everyone who is taller than any wall. And who knows that the stronger one bears more responsibility when it comes to saving people. It is difficult for us to endure without the help of the world, without your help. It is difficult to defend Ukraine, Europe without what you can do. So that you don’t look over your shoulder even after this war. After the destruction of Kharkiv... For the second time in 80 years. After the bombing of Chernihiv, Sumy and Donbas. For the second time in 80 years. After thousands of people tortured and killed. For the second time in 80 years. Otherwise, what is the historical responsibility to the Ukrainian people still not redeemed for what happened 80 years ago? And now - so that a new one does not appear, behind the new Wall, which will again demand redemption. I appeal to you and remind you of what is needed. The things without which Europe will not survive and will not preserve its values. Former actor, President of the United States Ronald Reagan once said in Berlin: Tear down this wall! And I want to tell you now. Chancellor Scholz! Tear down this wall. Give Germany the leadership you deserve. And what your descendants will be proud of. Support us. Support peace. Support every Ukrainian. Stop the war. Help us stop it. Glory to Ukraine!"
"To date, nine humanitarian corridors have been agreed upon to evacuate the population and send aid - Iryna Vereshchuk",2022-03-17T10:46:00Z,"As of March 17, nine humanitarian corridors have been agreed upon to evacuate residents of settlements affected by the Russian invasion. An information bureau for war prisoners has also been set up. This was announced by Deputy Prime Minister - Minister for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories Iryna Vereshchuk. In particular, an evacuation corridor from the city of Mariupol to the city of Zaporizhzhia has been agreed upon in the Donetsk region. ""We have asked for approval of this route and plan to send buses from the city of Zaporizhzhia to Berdyansk to gather people from Mariupol. We will also send a tank truck to refuel private cars on the route,"" she said. A number of humanitarian corridors are planned in the Kyiv region: From Borodyanka to Zhytomyr. From the village of Shevchenkove to the city of Brovary. ""We also plan to deliver humanitarian aid in the form of food and medicine to the cities of Hostomel and Bucha, the villages of Semypolky, Markivka and Opanasiv,"" said Iryna Vereshchuk. In the Kharkiv region, a humanitarian route from the city of Vovchansk to Kharkiv has been agreed upon. According to Iryna Vereshchuk, work is underway to ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid to all settlements that are surrounded or blocked. ""We are stepping up our efforts to free captured civilians,"" she said. These include the release of Dniprorudne Mayor Yevhen Matvieyev, Melitopol District Council Chairman Serhiy Pryyma, Ivankiv Mayor Tetiana Svyrydenko, Shchastya Civil City Administration Chairman Volodymyr Tiurin, Skadovsk City Council Secretary Yuriy Paliukh and SES rescuer Oleksiy Danchenko. Iryna Vereshchuk informed that in accordance with the Geneva Convention relative to the treatment of prisoners of war, the National Information Bureau was established on March 17. “It is determined that the state enterprise ""Ukrainian National Center for Peacebuilding"", which belongs to the Ministry of Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories, will be a legal entity of public law and perform the functions of the National Information Bureau. We have informed the Red Cross through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the establishment of such a bureau and we hope that our work will be fruitful and productive for people, families who are waiting for their children to return home from captivity,"" said the Deputy Prime Minister."
The world must officially recognize that Russia has become a terrorist state - address by the President of Ukraine,2022-03-17T01:05:00Z,"Wise people of a strong country! We have finally managed to release the mayor of Melitopol from captivity. Our Ukrainian Melitopol, which did not submit and will not submit to the occupiers. Ivan Fedorov is free. I talked to him today. The Russian military abducted him on March 11, trying to persuade him to collaborate. But our man withstood. He did not give up. Just as we all endure. You all. Just as we all do not give up. Because we are Ukrainians. And we always protect our own.  Today a protest action took place in Berdyansk again. Protest against the occupiers from the Russian Federation. Thousands of brave civilians came out against the armed Russian military. And they told them everything, everything they deserve. It is very important. I know it's hard. But it is also important that what they heard from our people, including in Russian, is clear and unambiguous: occupiers, go home. There is still such an opportunity. Every soldier thrown into the territory of our country has such an opportunity. Everyone who has not yet been killed, wounded or taken prisoner. Russian troops suffer such losses in Ukraine, which were inflicted neither in Syria, nor in Chechnya. Neither did the Soviet troops suffer such losses in Afghanistan. If your war, the war against the Ukrainian people, continues, the mothers of Russia will lose more children than in the Afghan and Chechen wars combined. What's the point of it? Every Russian soldier who lays down weapons will get a chance, a chance to survive. I appeal specifically to the conscripts who were thrown into the furnace of this war. Not your war. And to the rest of the Russian soldiers who still have the instinct of self-preservation. Lay down your weapons. It's better than dying on the battlefield, on our land. Unfortunately, the humanitarian corridors did not work on Wednesday. The Russian military did not stop shelling, did not guarantee security. We are ready to ensure silence. We are ready to take people out and send humanitarian aid. But we can't expose people to shelling on the road. Understand us. Expose to the fact that for the Russian military there is no such war crime, which they would not commit. We are taking away Mariupol residents who managed to escape to Berdyansk... We are taking them to Zaporizhzhia. In total, more than 6,000 Mariupol residents were transported in one day, more than 2,000 of them are children. The Russian military tried to disrupt this movement as well. They opened mortar fire on the section of the road between Vasylivka and Kamyanske in the Zaporizhzhia region. Only by a miracle there were no casualties. Five Ukrainians were wounded, including two children. In Chernihiv, the occupiers fired at civilians who were simply standing in line for bread. Imagine. Ten dead people. In Mariupol, in besieged Mariupol, Russian aircraft purposefully dropped a huge bomb on the Drama Theater in the city center. Hundreds of people were hiding from the shelling there... The building was destroyed. The death toll is still unknown. Our hearts are broken by what Russia is doing to our people. To our Mariupol. To the Donetsk region... Citizens of Russia! How is your blockade of Mariupol different from the blockade of Leningrad during World War II? Who do you inherit? We will not forget anyone whose lives were taken by the occupiers. We will not forgive any murdered soul. Eternal memory to all victims of this terror! To all the victims of the war unleashed by the Russian state. What else do the occupiers have to do, how many more people do they have to kill in order for Western leaders, NATO leaders to respond positively to Ukraine's request for a no-fly zone or for providing our country with the aircraft we so desperately need? I spoke about this today in a speech to the United States Congress. Ukraine has received strong support from our American friends. And I'm grateful to President Biden for that. I am grateful for the leadership that has united the democratic world. But the war does not end. Russia's war crimes do not stop. The Russian economy is still able to maintain their military machine. That is why new packages of sanctions against Russia are needed. The world must finally officially recognize that Russia has become a terrorist state. And most importantly, Ukraine needs to get more support. Even more than we get now. Air defense systems. Aircraft. Enough lethal weapons and ammunition to stop the Russian occupiers. It was in this speech in Congress that I addressed both the United States and all the relevant states as regards creating a new U-24 union. A new alliance that will ensure that each aggressor receives a coordinated response from the world. Fast and efficient. Immediately. Not in weeks, months, years, but in the first 24 hours after the attack. We can no longer trust the existing institutions. We cannot expect bureaucrats in international organizations to change so quickly. Therefore, we must look for new guarantees. Create new tools. Take those who have courage and do what justice requires. We have already proved that we can do historical things. This is not just our resistance. Not just defense. Even at this time - the biggest test for Ukraine - we managed to join the European energy network. Now Ukraine can use electricity flows from the European Union. We have been moving towards this for decades. It finally happened! I am grateful to all the power engineers of our country, to all those who worked for this result. We are already working on programs to restore our country after the war. I promise everyone, every Ukrainian who has lost home, who has lost an apartment as a result of hostilities or shelling that the state will restore everything. Restore independently. I am confident that we will be able to rebuild our state quickly. Whatever the damage may be... It will be a historic reconstruction. A project that will inspire the world just as our struggle for our freedom. Just as our struggle for our Ukraine. During the day I spoke with friends of Ukraine - President of Turkey Erdoğan and Prime Minister of Canada Trudeau. I thanked them for their support. We agreed on new steps for the sake of peace for our country. In a conversation with the Prime Minister of Ireland, I expressed condolences over the murder by the Russian military of an Irish citizen - journalist Pierre Zakrzewski. I also spoke with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. We agreed on the support for our citizens - temporary displaced persons. I will address the German Parliament on Thursday morning. I will continue to fight for even greater support for Ukraine, for even greater pressure on Russia. For the sake of our common victory, for the sake of peace for us. For the sake of peace for us, the Ukrainian delegation speaks with the Russian delegation. And I want all our citizens, citizens of Ukraine, to hear me now. Negotiations are ongoing. Negotiations for the sake of Ukraine. My priorities in the negotiations are absolutely clear: the end of the war, security guarantees, sovereignty, restoration of territorial integrity, real guarantees for our country, real protection for our country. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"
Address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the US Congress,2022-03-16T17:27:00Z,"Mrs. Speaker, Members of Congress, Ladies and Gentlemen, Americans! Friends! I am proud to greet you from Ukraine, from our capital - Kyiv. From a city that is under missile and air strikes by Russian troops. Daily. But it does not give up. And it didn't even think to give up for a single minute! Just as dozens of other cities and communities in our country, which found themselves in the worst war since World War II. I have the honor to greet you on behalf of the Ukrainian people, brave and freedom-loving people. For eight years they have been resisting the aggression of the Russian Federation. They sacrifice the best children - sons and daughters to stop the full-scale Russian invasion. Now the fate of our state is being decided. The fate of our people. It is being decided whether Ukrainians will be free. Whether they will preserve their democracy. Russia has attacked more than just our land and our cities. It went on a brutal offensive against our values. Basic human values. It threw tanks and planes against our freedom. Against our right to live freely in our country, choosing our own future. Against our desire for happiness. Against our national dreams. Just like yours, ordinary people of America. Just like those of everyone in the United States. I remember your Rushmore National Memorial. The faces of your prominent presidents. Those who laid the foundations of America. As it is today. Democracy, independence, freedom and care for everyone. Everyone who works diligently. Who lives honestly. Who respects the law. We in Ukraine want the same for ourselves. All that is a normal part of life for you. Ladies and Gentlemen! Americans! In your great history you have pages that will allow you to understand Ukrainians. Understand us now. When it is needed most. Remember Pearl Harbor. Terrible morning of December 7, 1941. When your sky was black from the planes attacking you. Just remember that. Remember September 11th. A terrible day in 2001, when evil tried to turn your cities into a battlefield. When innocent people were attacked. Attacked from the air. In a way no one expected. In a way you could not stop it. Our state experiences this every day! Every night! For three weeks now! Different Ukrainian cities... Odesa and Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Sumy, Zhytomyr and Lviv, Mariupol and Dnipro. Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death. For thousands of people. Russian troops have already fired nearly a thousand missiles at Ukraine. Countless bombs. They use drones to kill more precisely. This is a terror Europe has not seen for 80 years! And we ask for a response. For the response from the world. For the response to terror. Is this too much of a request? To establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine is to save people. Humanitarian no-fly zone. Conditions under which Russia will no longer be able to terrorize our peaceful cities every day and night. If that's too much, we offer an alternative. You know what defense systems we need. C-300 and other similar systems. You know how much depends on the battlefield on the ability to use aircraft. Powerful, strong aircraft. To protect your people. Your freedom. Your land. Aircraft that can help Ukraine. That can help Europe. And you also know that they are available. But on land. Not in the Ukrainian sky. They do not protect our people. ""I have a dream"" - these words are known to each of you. Today I can say: I have a necessity. The necessity to protect our sky. The necessity for your decision. Your help. And it will mean exactly the same thing. The same thing you feel. When you hear: I have a dream. Ladies and Gentlemen! Friends! Ukraine is grateful to the United States for its overwhelming support. For all that your state and your people have already done for our freedom. For weapons and ammunition, for training and funding, for leadership in the free world, which helps put pressure on the aggressor economically. I am grateful to President Biden for his personal involvement, for his sincere commitment to the defense of Ukraine and democracy around the world. I am grateful to you for the resolution, which recognizes all those who commit crimes against the Ukrainian people as war criminals. However, now, in the darkest time for our country, for the whole of Europe, I urge you to do more! New packages of sanctions are needed every week. Until the Russian military machine stops. Restrictions are needed as regards everyone on whom this unjust regime is based. We offer the United States to impose sanctions against all politicians in the Russian Federation who remain in office and do not sever ties with those responsible for the aggression against Ukraine. From State Duma deputies to the last official who lacks the morale to sever ties with state terror. All American companies must leave Russia, their market. Leave this market flooded with our blood. Ladies and Gentlemen. Members of Congress! Take the lead! If you have companies in the constituencies that sponsor the Russian military machine, keeping their business in Russia... You have to put pressure. So that the Russian state does not receive a single dollar, which it spends on the destruction of Ukraine. On the destruction of Europe. All American ports must be closed to Russian goods and ships. Peace is more important than profit. And we must defend this principle throughout the world together. We have already become part of the anti-war coalition. The great anti-war coalition, which unites many states, dozens of states. Those who reacted in a principled manner to President Putin's decision - to Russia's invasion of our state. But we have to move on. We have to create new tools. To respond quickly! And stop the war. The full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine began on February 24. And it would be fair if it ended in a day. In 24 hours. So that evil is punished immediately. Today the world does not have such tools. The wars of the past have prompted our predecessors to create institutions that were supposed to protect us from war. But... They don't work. We see it. You see it. So, we need new ones. New institutions. New alliances. And we offer them. We offer to create an association - U-24. United for peace. A union of responsible states that have the strength and conscience to stop conflicts. Immediately. Provide all necessary assistance in 24 hours. If necessary - weapons. If necessary - sanctions. Humanitarian support. Political support. Funding. Everything necessary to preserve peace quickly. To save lives. In addition, such an association could provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters, man-made disasters. Who fell victim to a humanitarian crisis or epidemic. Remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest thing - to give everyone vaccines. Vaccines against Covid. To save lives. To prevent new strains. The world spent months and years doing things that could have been done much faster. So that there were no human losses. Ladies and Gentlemen! Americans! If such an alliance, the U-24, had already been formed, I believe it would have saved thousands of lives. In our country, many other countries that need peace so crucially, that suffered inhuman destruction... I ask you to watch one video now. Video of what Russian troops did on our land. We have to stop this. We must prevent such things. Preventively destroy every aggressor who seeks to conquer another nation. Please watch... And in the end to sum it up. Today it is not enough to be the leader of the nation. Today it takes to be the Leader of the world. Being the Leader of the world means to be the Leader of Peace.  Peace in your country does not depend anymore only on you and your people. It depends on those next to you, on those who are strong. Strong does not mean big. Strong is brave and ready to fight for the life of his citizens and citizens of the world. For human rights, for freedom, for the right to live decently and to die when your time comes, not when it is wanted by someone else, by your neighbor.  Today the Ukrainian people are defending not only Ukraine, we are fighting for the values of Europe and the world, sacrificing our lives in the name of the Future. That's why today the American people are helping not just Ukraine, but Europe and the world to keep the planet alive, to keep justice in history. Now I am almost 45 years old. Today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating. I see no sense in life if it cannot stop death. And this is my main mission as the Leader of my people – great Ukrainians. And as the Leader of my nation I am addressing President Biden.  You are the Leader of the nation, of your great nation. I wish you to be the Leader of the world. Being the Leader of the world means to be the Leader of Peace. Thank you. Glory to Ukraine!"
President of Ukraine held a meeting with the International Criminal Court Prosecutor ,2022-03-16T16:26:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a video conference with International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan who is on a visit to our country. The President noted the importance of the decision of the International Criminal Court to start an investigation into Russia's horrific violations of international criminal law during the invasion of Ukraine. The President also thanked him for the visit to our country at this difficult time. ""It is very important for us during the war, during the aggression of the Russian state against our people, that you reacted so quickly, so professionally,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He assured that the Ukrainian authorities are ready to provide maximum assistance to the ICC investigation team, which began working in our country in March. The Prosecutor General of Ukraine and relevant law enforcement agencies are involved in this work. ""Everyone understands what is happening. There are already two thousand war prisoners, there are witnesses, there are video testimonies and everything they said without pressure. All those who took people's lives for nothing on our land must be punished. We will cooperate with you at the highest level,"" the President said. He stressed that no war crime or crime against humanity committed as a result of Russia's aggression against Ukraine should be left unpunished. Everyone guilty must be brought to international legal and criminal responsibility - from the perpetrators to the military-political leadership of the aggressor country. Karim Khan, for his part, said that he had already had the opportunity to see photos and videos of the aftermath of the invasion and bombings in Mariupol and other cities - the suffering of people, including children and women. ""The law must now move forward and be used to protect these people,"" the International Criminal Court Prosecutor said. He stated that in order to support Ukraine in this struggle, a historically rapid unification of a large number of countries took place. ""They realized that the rule of law could not just live in universities and courts. It must be put into practice if we want justice,"" Karim Khan said, adding that he looked forward to effective cooperation with Ukraine to receive information from all intercepted evidence in order to really get to the bottom of it. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that he was ready to do everything possible to facilitate the ICC investigation ""so that all criminals could be brought to justice."""
"As of today, Ukraine has become a member of the European Energy Union - Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-03-16T15:51:00Z,"The system operator of the Ukrainian power grid Ukrenergo, together with its European counterparts, has completed the integration of domestic and European energy systems. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ""Ukrainian and European energy systems are already working synchronously,"" the President said. He reminded that on the night when Russia started the war against Ukraine, our state disconnected from the Russian and Belarusian energy systems and will never return. ""The enemy expected that the Ukrainian power system would collapse, that we would not be able to cope, so he seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately bombed and keeps bombing thermal power plants in Ukrainian cities and power lines. But the Ukrainian energy system has worked stably and steadily throughout the 21 days of the war, as recognized by Europeans. And starting from today we are no longer alone. As of today, Ukrainian electricity flows to Europe and European electricity flows to Ukraine,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. According to him, from now on the Ukrainian energy system has reliable energy reserves, which are located abroad, so it is protected from attacks by the invader. ""I am thankful to all the EU member states, personally to President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, European Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson and dozens of people from Ukraine and Europe who worked day and night during these days of war, so that today we can say this: Ukraine is in the ""energy EU"". We now have a single energy circulatory system from Lisbon to Mariupol. Ukraine is in the ""energy eurozone"". We cannot be defeated,"" the President said."
For every act of terrorism by Russian troops on the territory of Ukraine there will be an international tribunal - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-03-16T13:38:00Z,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! We are stepping up work to bring the invaders to justice. There must be an international tribunal. And it will be. For everything they did against Ukraine. Against our people. For every act of terrorism of Russian troops on the territory of our state. The Prosecutor's Office of Ukraine and law enforcement agencies have already started this work. The launch of the activity of the investigative group of the International Criminal Court in Ukraine is also important, which together with our law enforcement officers is already collecting all the evidence, collecting the facts of war crimes of the invaders on the territory of our state. So that they receive the legal answer - legal and concrete. I spoke with Karim Khan, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in The Hague. He is already in Ukraine, he has already started working. Therefore, the invaders will be responsible for all war crimes against Ukrainians. Last night, Russian troops continued shelling Ukrainian territory, our peaceful cities, our citizens. Kharkiv and the region... They bombed the coast of the Odesa region. They fired missiles at Kyiv. Hit civilian infrastructure of Zaporizhzhia. As of this morning, 103 children have been killed. Russian troops have now inflicted hundreds of times more damage on Ukraine than on Donbas in eight years of war. And the territories of Donbas, border regions in the Russian direction, Kyiv region and the south of Ukraine suffered the most. The most affected areas are those that Russian propagandists have always spoken of as the place of residence of people especially close to Russia. Apparently, there are no non-nuclear weapons that the invaders have not yet used against our civilians. That's their closeness. That's their friendship. That’s, as they said in Moscow, ""a divided nation."" A total of 400 educational institutions have been destroyed in Ukraine to date, the largest number is in the Donetsk region - 119. In Mariupol, the invaders seized a hospital, a regional intensive care hospital. Already damaged by Russian bombs. Patients and doctors are in captivity. Residents of neighboring houses were forced to go inside the hospital as well. More than 400 people are hostages! And the invaders are using the hospital as a firing position to shell the city. This regular crime of the Russian military against Mariupol is no different from Basayev's seizure of the hospital in Budyonnovsk. Although... It is different. Now it's even more treacherous. Last night, the invaders took hostage six people in the Bucha City Council. A Ukrainian rescuer who was captured in an agreed humanitarian corridor is being held hostage! The mayors of several of our cities, activists, a journalist are being held hostage... The Russian state has become an outspoken terrorist. And it is not ashamed. But it will be responsible for everything. The world is already beginning to understand that without the recognition of Russia as a terrorist state, it will be impossible to restore justice for Ukraine, it will be impossible to restore international order. Today I signed an important decree on a nationwide minute of silence to honor the memory of all Ukrainians who died in our patriotic war. All those we lost because of the Russian invasion. Because of the terror committed by the invaders . Every morning at 9 am in the whole territory of our state we will remember the Ukrainians who gave their lives. All who fought. All military and all civilians. Adults and children... Everyone! All those who could still be alive if Russia had not started this war. May the memory of everyone who died for Ukraine live forever! The losses of the invaders continue to grow. The number of killed enemy soldiers is already approaching 14,000. Tens of thousands of Russian servicemen were wounded. They have already lost more than a hundred helicopters. Soon there will be hundreds of lost planes. More than 400 Russian tanks were destroyed, plus several thousand units of other equipment. We take abandoned enemy equipment from the battlefield and use it to protect our state and our people. Ukrainians! If you know where the enemy is and where he abandoned his tanks or other armored vehicles, ordnance, inform the Ukrainian forces. Let's use everything for our victory! And for the sake of victory be wise. Don't publish details of our air defense work when you hear the guys work. Do not publish maps that you find in abandoned Russian vehicles and in the broken command posts of the invaders. Please give them to our military. Let them use it to make the enemy suffer! Today at 3 pm Kyiv time I will address the Congress of the United States of America. This will be an important speech. A speech from all of us, from each of our defenders, from each of our citizens. Addressed to the most powerful democracy in the world. To the state and the people who can do a lot to stop Russian aggression, to restore peace on our land. Eight years ago, on this day, the Russian state organized a fake ""referendum"" on the territory of our Ukrainian Crimea. Which it later used to justify the seizure of our territory. It was illegal. This was the destruction of the entire security architecture in Europe, which was created after World War II. But Russia went for it. If then there had been at least a hint of such resistance, which we are showing now, which you are showing now... If then the world had reacted at least half as it should react now and reacts... I'm sure we would have had neither this invasion, nor eight years of war in Donbas. All this evil was born from the occupation of Crimea. From our weakness, the brutal actions of Russia, for which it should have been punished already in 2014. We are much stronger now, we are united. Now we are a great nation. But... We don't have a time machine and we can't go back to the moment when everything was decided. We can and must fight today, now. We can and must protect our state, our Ukrainian life. We can and must hold negotiations on a just and fair peace for Ukraine. On the real security guarantees that will work. This is an ambitious task. A difficult one. This is a long way. But I am sure that we, Ukrainians, can do all this. We, Ukrainians, can win. And return to peace. To the peace we all so strive for. Glory to our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"
Ukrainian side has not yet received approval of humanitarian corridors for evacuation of the population on March 16 - Iryna Vereshchuk,2022-03-16T10:43:00Z,"As of March 16, the Ukrainian side has not received a response on the approval of humanitarian corridors, and so far there are no guarantees for the safe evacuation of residents of settlements affected by the Russian invasion. This was announced by Deputy Prime Minister - Minister for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories Iryna Vereshchuk. ""During the work of humanitarian corridors in the last few days, Russia has started gross violations of the ceasefire agreements. The invaders began firing at humanitarian convoys of buses, settlements and gathering places of people from which the evacuation of civilians was planned, as well as taking hostages of escorts,"" she said. Iryna Vereshchuk reminded that Oleksiy Danchenko, a rescuer from the State Emergency Service, remains in captivity. In addition, the invaders seized an intensive care hospital in Mariupol, took hostage 400 people, medical staff, and shelling is held from there now. ""We have not received a response to our proposals made yesterday to the International Committee of the Red Cross to open humanitarian corridors today. The issue of organizing humanitarian corridors today for Izyum and Mariupol remains open. In such conditions, of course, we cannot safely evacuate people,"" said the Deputy Prime Minister. According to her, work is underway to organize the delivery of humanitarian aid, including food and medicine, to the captured or surrounded settlements of the Luhansk, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia, Sumy, Chernihiv and Kherson regions. Iryna Vereshchuk added that in case of change or opening of humanitarian corridors she will inform during the day."
"Resistance, resilience and courage of our defenders make it possible to save our people and our land - address by the President of Ukraine",2022-03-16T01:46:00Z,"Free people of a free country! Eight years of war in Donbas, 20 days of full-scale invasion. The third week is about to be over. We all want peace. As soon as possible. We all want to win. And there is always a feeling that a little more, and we will get what belongs to us, Ukraine, by right. But... But efforts are still needed. It takes patience. We still have to fight. And work - everyone in their place. Everyone. In particular, our representatives, our delegation in negotiations with the Russian Federation. It is important. It is difficult, but important, because any war ends in an agreement. Meetings continue. As I am told, the positions in the negotiations sound more realistic. However, time is still needed for the decisions to be in Ukraine's interests. Our heroes, our defenders give us this time. Defending Ukraine everywhere. Wherever the enemy wants to break through. The invaders did not succeed today. Although thousands of their people were thrown into battle. In the north and east, in the south of our state. The enemy lost equipment, hundreds of soldiers... Many Russian conscripts died. Dozens of officers. One more general is among the killed invaders. At least one general today. The invaders also committed new and obvious war crimes. They fired at peaceful cities and civilian infrastructure. The number of missiles that Russia has used against Ukraine already exceeds 900. There are so many air bombs that it is impossible to count them. Two more journalists were killed in an artillery strike by Russian troops. Ukrainian Oleksandra Kuvshynova and Fox News representative Pierre Zakrzewski. Another journalist was heavily wounded. The shelling took place in the Kyiv region. And this is another big reason to tighten Western sanctions against the Russian Federation. Tighten until the Russian state stops the war. Citizens of Russia! Any of you who have access to truthful information could already understand how this war will end for your country. Shame and poverty. Years of isolation. A very cruel repressive system that will treat the citizens of Russia in the same inhumane way as you, invaders, treated Ukrainians. What happens next depends on your actions. I want to speak directly to all the officials of the Russian Federation, to everyone who is related to the current government: if you remain in office, if you do not oppose the war, the international community will deprive you of everything. Everything you have earned over the years. This is already being done. The same goes for the propaganda system. The fourth branch of power in Russia. If you stay to work for propaganda, you are putting yourself at much greater risk than if you just leave. Just quit. The risk of sanctions and an international tribunal for propaganda of an aggressive war, for justifying war crimes. Quit! A few months without a job is definitely better for you than a lifetime of international persecution. Today the Prime Ministers of the three partner states and the three friendly states of Ukraine visited Kyiv. Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia. Poland was also represented by Deputy Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński and the Prime Minister of Poland. I was glad to meet, to talk directly, in person, in our capital. This is important support. When our Kyiv is a target for the invaders, it is especially important and especially courageous to be here, next to us, next to friends. This is how leadership is shown. And I invite all friends of Ukraine to visit Kyiv. It can be dangerous here. It is true. Because our sky is not yet closed to Russian missiles and planes. The decision to strengthen our arsenal in the air has not yet been made. We have not received planes. But... You know for sure that the eyes of all the people of the world are now focused on our capital, on Ukrainians. So everyone who is with us will receive gratitude. Not only ours, but also of other nations of the world. Everyone who is with us has a chance to become a real hero. I addressed the Canadian Parliament. In fact, in front of the entire political community of this country - our friend. In front of all Canadians. I thanked them for their support - really sincere support. Canada was among the first to come to the rescue of Ukraine. And I called on Canadians to maintain that leadership. Help Ukraine. Not in words, but in deeds: weapons, new sanctions against Russia. As well as an active moral position. A position as regards all international businesses that still stay in Russia, that do not leave. Although they fully understand that they are sponsoring the war, sponsoring terror. My address to the United States Congress is scheduled for Wednesday. An important event. And today I would like to thank President Biden and all the friends of Ukraine in the United States for the new $13.6 billion package of support for our country, our people. The law providing for this funding has been signed. We consider it as the first step towards the full restoration of Ukraine. The Verkhovna Rada also met today. The meeting was effective. Economic innovations have been approved - tax cuts that should save jobs and allow Ukraine's business to work. Wherever possible. There is a zero rate of excise duty and 7% VAT on fuel to stabilize prices and ensure supply. Business regulation is simplified as much as possible. We are reducing the activities of control bodies so that there are no unnecessary inspections for those who work in accordance with Ukrainian law and do not violate consumer rights. The new law also provides the necessary guarantees for the territorial defense warriors - all volunteers will be recognized as combat veterans. A technical decision was made to continue martial law. This is needed to effectively defend the state. Also all nuances of police activity during martial law are settled. I am waiting for the adopted laws to sign them. And I am grateful to the people's deputies of Ukraine for the fact that the majority of votes collected more than 340 votes in favor. This demonstrates the political unity of Ukraine. Finally. When all parties and groups work together in a legitimately elected parliament, one of the main myths of the invaders that the Ukrainian government allegedly does not represent the will of the people is shattered. It definitely does! And all the collaborators who decided to work a little for the invaders must already think where in Rostov they will hide from punishment. I hope that on Wednesday the long-awaited rescue of people from the city of Izyum, Kharkiv region, will take place. The humanitarian corridor has been agreed upon. Over the past 24 hours, 28,893 Ukrainians were rescued from combat areas in Sumy, Kharkiv and Donetsk regions. 20,000 of them managed to leave Mariupol. So far only by personal vehicles. There will be a difficult situation. We are fighting for you. Sorry, everything is very difficult. The Ukrainian humanitarian convoy is still constantly blocked by Russian soldiers on the way to the city. But we will not give up trying to save people, to save the city. And I am grateful to each of our defenders! To every defender of Mariupol, Kharkiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, Zhytomyr, Mykolaiv and all other cities this evil wants to capture. I am grateful to all who hold on and fight for life. Your resistance, your resilience, your courage make it possible for Ukraine to survive. And save our people and our land. I signed a decree on awarding state awards to 139 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who distinguished themselves in the defense of our state. 32 of them - posthumously. I also signed a decree on conferring the title of Hero of Ukraine with the Order of the Golden Star to: Colonel Hudz Valeriy Fedorovych. Posthumously. For the heroic defense of Popasna in the Luhansk region. Colonel Kotenko Serhiy Leonidovych. Posthumously. Thanks to his courageous actions and personal determination, several columns of enemy equipment were destroyed. Colonel Maryniak Oleksandr Myroslavovych. Posthumously. Due to his determination, a large number of enemy soldiers, groups of fuel tanks and enemy equipment were destroyed during the defense of the Kyiv region. Major Sbytov Pavlo Olehovych. Posthumously. Thanks to his professionalism and decisive actions, the destruction of several large enemy units was organized. May the memory of everyone who died for our Ukraine live forever! On conferring the title of Hero of Ukraine with the Order of the Golden Star to: Senior Lieutenant Dozirchy Dmytro Leonidovych. His effective actions in the defense of the Kherson region allowed our forces to get out of the encirclement and continue the struggle. Senior Lieutenant Sydunets Volodymyr Volodymyrovych. Thanks to his actions, the division of the Russian Iskanders was destroyed. Glory to all of you! Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"
"Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with the heads of governments of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia in Kyiv",2022-03-16T00:25:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Prime Minister of Poland Mateusz Morawiecki, Deputy Prime Minister of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński, Prime Minister of the Czech Republic Petr Fiala and Prime Minister of Slovenia Janez Janša who arrived in Kyiv. The President of Ukraine thanked the heads of government of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia for the support their countries provide to Ukraine, as well as for their personal visit to Kyiv. ""At a time when many ambassadors have left Ukraine in connection with the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, these dignitaries, leaders of their beautiful independent European states, fear nothing, care for our fate more, and they are here to support us. This is a great courageous, correct and friendly step. And I am sure that with such friends, with such countries, with such neighbors and partners, we will really be able to win,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters after the meeting. The President noted that the talks focused on security guarantees for Ukraine, strengthening sanctions against the aggressor state, as well as the prospects of Ukraine's membership in the European Union. The interlocutors also touched upon plans to rebuild our country after the end of hostilities. In this context, international assistance in replenishing the relevant reconstruction funds already established by the Ukrainian government is important. ""We know for sure that everything we are discussing will reach the positive goal for our country, our security and our future,"" the President stressed."
Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Parliament of Canada,2022-03-15T19:57:00Z,"Dear speakers! Mr. Prime Minister! Dear Justin! Members of the government and parliament! Dear attendees, Dear friends! Before I begin, I want you to understand my feelings, the feelings of Ukrainians. As much as possible. Feelings during these 20 days. 20 days of full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation after eight years of war in Donbas. Just imagine... Imagine that at four in the morning each of you hears explosions. Terrible explosions. Justin, imagine that you hear it. And your children hear it. Hear missile strikes at Ottawa airport. At dozens of other places throughout your beautiful country, Canada. Cruise missiles. Even before dawn. And your children hug you and ask: “what happened, dad?” And you are already receiving the first reports on which facilities in your country have been destroyed by missiles of the Russian Federation. And you know how many people have already died and where. Imagine you are looking for words to explain this to children. Explain to them that a large-scale war has begun. The war aimed at the destruction of your state, at the conquest of your people. And you know it. The second day - and you get a message about the columns of armored vehicles. Thousands, thousands coming to your land. First - small cities, then larger ones. They want to block them all. And they do so. They approach Edmonton - imagine - and fire artillery. Fire at residential areas, at people. Schools are being burned down, kindergartens are being blown up. Just as in our cities - in Sumy, in our Okhtyrka. They blockade Vancouver and besiege hundreds of thousands of people who remain in the city. As in our Mariupol. For the second week under fire, without electricity completely, almost without food, definitely without water. In the basements. Justin! Dear attendees! Gentlemen! Imagine hearing the report on the dead every day. Yes, you are the president or the head of government, but you just hear about it, about the dead children. And the death toll is growing. 97 children were killed as of this morning. The famous CN Tower in Toronto... How many Russian missiles will be enough to destroy it? Believe me, I do not wish this to all of you... But we predict every day how many more missiles can hit our TV towers. And they hit them. Our Freedom Square in Kharkiv and your Churchill Square in Edmonton. Imagine Russian missiles hitting its heart. Our Babyn Yar is the burial place of the Holocaust victims... The Russians did not stop before bombing even this land. And what about the National Holocaust Monument in Ottawa? Will it withstand the impact of three or five missiles? It happened to us. Air bombs. A minute ago there were people alive. There was a family that just came there. They were alive. And now... You understand. And then a terrible night... each of these 20, when the Russian militaries fire from tanks at housing estates. From tanks - at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Direct guidance. When the fire started there. Can you imagine that happening to your Bruce Station in Ontario? And what would you feel if you saw your flag in every city where they pass, how your flag in Montreal is removed... Removed to be thrown away and replaced with a Russian one. I know that you support Ukraine, sincerely, effectively. We are friends with Justin. But I want you to understand me, and to feel it. Feel what we feel. Feel how we want to live. And how we want to win. Win for life. I want you to feel what it's like when you call your friends and say: close the sky, stop the shelling. No matter which way, just do it. Stop the bombing. How many more missiles must fall on our cities? And in response you hear that someone does not want to do it ... But they are deeply concerned! Then give us planes, we tell our partners. They answer: Soon. Be patient a little. Everyone is deeply concerned. They just don't want to. And someone is looking for reasons. The main thing is the result. They talk about escalation. How can it get worse? They say Ukraine is not in NATO now. Although ""the door is open"". But for whom are these doors and where do they lead, if we are told that we will not be admitted. War always shows everything people are capable of. Who is strong. And who is weak. Who is wise. Who does not see the obvious. Who is honest and who is a hypocrite. And we saw it all. And we understood all this. In 20 days and eight years. I'm sure you've seen it all. Dear speakers! Mr. Prime Minister! Members of the government. Members of parliament! Dear friends! Canada has always been, is and, I am sure, will be a reliable partner in Ukraine. Partner of our land, our people of Ukraine, each of our families. You came to our aid as soon as we asked for it. You are giving us the weapons and other support we so desperately need now. You have imposed sanctions against Russia - truly moral. Really substantial. However, we see that the war, unfortunately, continues. That Russian troops are not leaving our territory. You see that our cities: Kharkiv, Mariupol are not as protected as your Edmonton and Vancouver. That Kyiv is under missile strikes. Like Chernihiv, Zhytomyr, Ivano-Frankivsk and dozens, dozens of our Ukrainian cities that yesterday were peaceful and quiet. That means more needs to be done. Much more! For peace. We all have to do more to stop Russia. To protect Ukraine and protect Europe from this total evil that is destroying everything: memorials, churches, schools, hospitals, neighborhoods and all our businesses. They have already killed 97 Ukrainian children! We do not ask for much. We ask for justice. We ask for real support that will help us endure and defend our life. Life of the whole world. Canada is already showing the necessary leadership! It is already the first to do what other countries come to later. But we need more leadership, and we ask for more participation from you. Justin! All friends of our country Ukraine! All friends of the truth! You understand how important it is for us to protect our skies from Russian missiles and planes. You can influence this. It seems so to me. You can force even more companies to leave the Russian market. So that there is not a single dollar for the war. If they stay in Russia and sponsor the war, they are not allowed to work in Canada. Let it be so - and it will give us peace. You know, perhaps better than many in the world, that this attack by Russia is an attempt to destroy us, to destroy the Ukrainian people. Nothing else. This is their main goal. This is a war against the people. Against our people. This is a war to destroy everything that makes Ukrainians Ukrainians. Against our future. Against our character. Against our will. Everything that you, Canadians, know very well, feel very well. So I ask you: do not stop. Do not stop helping Ukraine. Do not stop in leadership and in efforts to bring peace back to our peaceful land. I believe, I know you can handle it. I know that with Canada, our anti-war coalition, which we are reinforcing, will definitely yield the result. I want to address our Ukrainian diaspora, all Ukrainians in Canada. It is at this historic moment that we need your effective help. And you must prove with your steps that you are a part of the history of Ukraine, the living history of Ukraine. Remember this - living. Because we want to live. And we strive for peace. I thank you for your support. I am thankful to everyone present in this hall of parliament. To every citizen of Canada. I'm grateful to you, Justin. Grateful on behalf of the entire Ukrainian nation. I am sure that together - and only together - we will defeat all enemies. Glory to Ukraine! Thank you Canada!"
Every shot of Russia at Ukraine is a step towards its self-destruction - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ,2022-03-15T17:29:00Z,"Strong people of our indomitable country! Eight years of war against us. The 20th day of full-scale invasion. Attempts to destroy us all, to destroy Ukraine. We are fighting for our lives. We are fighting for our lives against missiles, bombs, artillery, tanks, mortars and everything else that Russian troops are using to destroy us. Everything else that Russia is destroying itself with now. Because every shot at Ukraine, every blow at Ukraine are steps towards Russia's self-destruction. Steps to self-isolation, poverty and degradation. Everyone who just wants to live and has something to think with is leaving Russia. Scientists, artists, businessmen, IT specialists, etc. The Russian state has not experienced such a blow at human capital for decades. A blow, which it inflicted on itself. We do not care. This is not our problem. Our problem is to save our people. The strength of our society. Its scientists, its artists, its businessmen, its people, its strong people. All our Ukrainians who defend the state and bring closer the peace that every Ukrainian needs. Last night there were air alarms almost all over our country. The airport in Dnipro was destroyed by a missile strike. Kharkiv. Russian bombs hit residential areas. Artillery. Mortars. Fighting continues in the region - Izyum, Chuhuiv. Disassembly of wreckage in Rivne after the missile strike on the TV tower is ongoing. As of now, 19 casualties are confirmed. Ancient Chernihiv and Oster are under such a brutal attack by Russia that it has wiped out any claims to its cultural ties to the times of Rus'. The invaders have no roots, no memory and no soul. Russian troops attacked Kyiv, attacked Kyiv residents. Four apartment buildings were destroyed. Disassembly of the debris is still ongoing. As of now, five casualties are confirmed. I will tell you in Russian: this happened in our capital. In the city that you always called “the mother of Russian cities”. That made our nations historical. And that you bombed today. Just people, residential areas. Bombed and bombed again. We don't need such children. No, thanks. The invaders continue to consider the capture of our capital as their key goal, their political goal. They hope that control over Kyiv will give them control over Ukraine. This is absolute absurdity from all points of view. To further strengthen the defense of the capital and the Kyiv region, I appointed Hero of Ukraine, Lieutenant General and Commander of the Joint Forces Operation Oleksandr Pavliuk head of the regional military administration. Dismissed head of the regional administration Oleksiy Kuleba will help the military leadership. Therefore, the Kyiv direction and the situation in the region will get even more attention. Major General Eduard Moskaliov became the new commander of the Joint Forces. Professional man, patriotic man. The decree is signed. Every morning, every evening, I thank the military. I thank all our heroes who bravely defend our state. All who stop the enemy despite the fact that the invaders are many times more. Dozens of times. And now, today, I want to speak about all peaceful Ukrainians who were taken away by this war. Eternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine! Eternal curse to the enemy who took thousands of lives. Humanitarian corridors have been partially opened today. There is a corridor from Sumy, Trostyanets, Lebedyn, Shostka and Konotop in the direction of Poltava. The invaders did not stop the shelling and disrupted humanitarian corridors in the Kyiv region. The convoy with humanitarian cargo for Mariupol also remains blocked. For several days in a row. But still little by little people are leaving the besieged city by private transport. I want to thank SES officers, police, doctors and everyone else who saves people for this important work. And of course, I am thankful to our military. Today I spoke at the summit organized by Great Britain, a friend of Ukraine - Boris Johnson. I addressed the United Kingdom Joint Expeditionary Force. Spoke to the leaders of the Baltic states and the countries of northern Europe. I said what, of course, all our citizens would like to say. About NATO. About help. About sincerity and... the fact that not everyone took a moral stance in response to the Russian war. Each of more than 800 Russian missiles that have hit our country is an answer to a long-standing question about NATO. Whether the doors of the Alliance are really open for Ukraine. If they were open, if it was fair, we would not have to convince the Alliance for 20 days that the sky over Ukraine should be closed. Closed to the death brought by the Russian Air Force. But... They don't hear or don't want to hear us yet. Some Allies have intimidated themselves. Saying that they allegedly can't answer. They cannot collide with Russian missiles and planes in the sky of Ukraine. Because this, they say, will lead to escalation, will lead to World War III... And what will they say if Russia goes further into Europe, attacking other countries? I'm sure it's the same thing they say to Ukraine. Article 5 of the NATO treaty has never been as weak as it is now. This is just our opinion. When some members of the Alliance are afraid to be truly an alliance capable of protecting everything for which it was created. Freedom and democracy. Humanity and justice. We need to look for effective guarantees. Guarantees for us, for our sky. And we will not give up. We need planes. And I will continue to talk about it, I will continue to pursue it. We need long-term security guarantees for the state. For all Ukrainians. Concrete things. Concrete guarantees. Legally enshrined. So that there is no doubt in them. And so that no excuses sound. As they sound now, when we turn to those who signed ""Budapest"" and who... had the power to stop the Russian invasion even before it began. Using preventive measures. By helping Ukraine, which is convincing. Using sanctions that do not allow war. Ukrainians! There are more than 40 million of us in our state. And millions more around the world. This is a great force. Plus our friends. Plus many of our partner countries. We all now have a common task, a national task. We must put pressure on Russia so that the price for this war against Ukraine becomes extremely painful. So that everyone in the world takes a moral stance. Not only states, but also companies. I'm talking about business. Large corporations that still sponsor Russia's military machine and have not left the Russian market, although they should have done so immediately. As soon as the world saw what Russian troops were doing on our Ukrainian land. You know these brands. They are well known. And there are no secrets here. Nestle, Mondelēz and other giants of the food industry. As well as Raiffeisen, Societe Generale and other banks. BASF, Samsung and LG. Bayer, Sanofi and other pharma companies. Unilever, Johnson & Johnson... And dozens of other companies. And that's billions of dollars. We turn to the world. To states and to people. But this is not just the work of politicians. I appeal to Ukrainians. To everyone and in any country. Where you can influence it. Everything is in your power. All business with Russia must be stopped. All trade operations. So that they can't sponsor the killings. Killings of us and our children. So that dollars and euros are not paid for blood. Please contact politicians. Put pressure. Talk to reporters. Boycott their products. They must feel our strength! They must feel your strength! Because we have the strength. Glory to Ukraine!"
Volodymyr Zelenskyy at a meeting of the Joint Expeditionary Force leaders presented his vision of how to stop Russian aggression,2022-03-15T16:08:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy took part in a meeting of representatives of the member states of the Joint Expeditionary Force chaired by Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson in the format of a video conference. During the event, the President of Ukraine presented his vision of how to stop Russian aggression and ensure lasting peace on the European continent. First of all, the President thanked the partner countries of Ukraine for the support and assistance they provide. “Our people will always remember who came to the rescue at the most difficult time for our state,” he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized that the world needs new security guarantees, as the old ones have proved their ineffectiveness. “The Russian invasion of Ukraine destroyed everything that security in our region, and I am sure international security, was based on. The weight of the organizations we all hoped for. The force of international conventions. It has also called into question the world's most powerful alliance, NATO,” the President of Ukraine stressed. According to him, NATO has not yet plucked courage to close the Ukrainian sky to Russian missiles and planes, and Russian troops continue to bomb peaceful Ukrainian cities and kill people, blow up houses, hospitals and schools. Therefore, as the Head of State noted, European countries, especially those bordering Russia, are now not sure that the Alliance will not be afraid to react if Russian missiles and planes fly to them. After all, Russian state propagandists are already directly saying that the war against Ukraine is just the beginning, that other European countries will be next. This is not denied in the Kremlin. “We emphasize that we need new formats of interaction, new determination. And if we cannot enter NATO's ""open door"", then we must work with communities available, communities that will help us. Like yours. And have some guarantees. We would like to have reliable guarantees that will work for us. And also for you,” the President of Ukraine noted. “We suggested a way. The way for Ukraine to be able to protect its skies and its people on its own. I would like everyone to hear this, especially those countries that have borders with Russia. We do everything to get planes. To get air defense,” he added. The Ukrainian Head of State also stressed the need to increase sanctions pressure on Russia until its aggressive rhetoric and intentions change. According to him, many global companies have not left the Russian market despite the imposition of tough sanctions against Russia. Some, having said they had left, are actually just waiting how this will end and when it will be possible to return. “There is no international mechanism for influencing corporations today. If they ignore blood, the world can do nothing. And this is when the worst war since World War II continues. This needs to be addressed. Now. Before Russia goes further. The sanctions policy should be such that no one could even think of war. The question is not only in Russia - the question is in the future: what else can happen,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. According to him, the ban on the Russian fleet to use world ports, the complete disconnection of Russian banks from SWIFT, the recognition of Russia as a terrorist state, as well as an embargo on any trade with Russia are needed. “We emphasize that this is necessary for us, but it is also necessary for you. For the whole world, for peace in Ukraine, in Europe,” the President said and thanked the UK and every country that has taken a moral position. The Ukrainian President stressed that the ""Russian military machine"" can still be stopped to end the killings and, most importantly, the destruction of democracies. “I think we all know this practice and these tragedies: missiles and bombs, helicopters and tanks, saboteurs and cyberattacks - all that is in the arsenal of today's Russia. Everything will be directed against Europe if Ukraine does not survive. Therefore, I ask you: help yourself by helping us. You know what weapons we need. You know what means of protection we need. You know we crucially need airplanes. It would be extremely difficult for us without your efforts. I am grateful to you. But understand - we need more,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. He said that Ukrainian defenders captured Russian equipment on the battlefield and sent it back against the enemy, as well as used old Soviet equipment that had not worked for decades. However, this is not enough, because, according to statistics, there is 1 Ukrainian tank per 100 Russian tanks, and 1 Ukrainian military per up to 30 soldiers of the occupying forces. “That's why we really want you to help us. I am sure that you will be able to increase the volume and feel how it will strengthen your protection, your security together with ours. How this will make the world stable not only in our country, but also in your countries,” the President emphasized. Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke in favor of strengthening the anti-war coalition and stressed that our strength lies in rapid action and solidarity. “Our strength is in the truth. It is on our side. We can stop the war with Russia. So that peace that Ukrainians strive for comes. Peace that the world strives for,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy concluded."
"To date, nine humanitarian corridors have been agreed upon in Kyiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Donetsk regions - Iryna Vereshchuk",2022-03-15T10:21:00Z,"Nine humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of residents of settlements affected by the Russian invasion will open in Ukraine on March 15 at 9:00. This was announced by Deputy Prime Minister - Minister for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories Iryna Vereshchuk. According to her, evacuation of people from Mariupol is planned in the Donetsk region. ""Humanitarian cargo will leave Berdyansk for the city of Mariupol - tens of tons of water, medicines, products for people who are very much looking forward to it. And on the way back, the transport will take women, children and all those in need from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia,"" said the Deputy Prime Minister. Corridors are opening in the Kyiv region in the following directions: From the villages of Bohdanivka and Nova Bohdanivka in the direction of Brovary. From the village of Bobryk in the direction of Brovary. ""We know about the huge problem in Ivankiv, we are working on this route. I sincerely hope that tomorrow we will be able to open this humanitarian corridor,"" Iryna Vereshchuk added. Evacuation from the cities of Sumy, Trostyanets, Shostka, Lebedyn and Konotop to Poltava is planned for March 15 in the Sumy region. A humanitarian corridor from the village of Oskil has been agreed upon in the Kharkiv region. ""I want to assure you that all the information you provide on Facebook and other channels comes to us and we process it. We promise not to leave anyone behind. We remember, we know and we really want to save you,"" said the Deputy Prime Minister."
Responsibility for war crimes of the Russian military is inevitable - address by the President of Ukraine,2022-03-15T01:29:00Z,"Free people of a free country! The 19th day of our resistance is over. Historical war. Another difficult day, which is still approaching our victory. Approaching peace for Ukraine. As before, the enemy is confused. They did not expect such resistance. They believed in their propaganda, which has been lying about us for decades.They still can't recollect themselves. But they have already begun to understand that they will not achieve anything by war. Their soldiers know this. Their officers are aware of this. They flee the battlefield. They abandon equipment. We take trophies and use them to protect Ukraine. Today, Russian troops are, in fact, one of the suppliers of equipment to our army. They could not imagine such a thing in a nightmare. And I want to tell the Russian soldiers. Those who have already entered our land. And who are just about to be sent to fight against us. Russian conscripts! Listen to me very carefully. Russian officers! You've already understood everything. You will not take anything from Ukraine. You will take lives. There are a lot of you. But your life will also be taken. But why should you die? What for? I know that you want to survive. We hear your conversations in the intercepts, we hear what you really think about this senseless war, about this disgrace and about your state. Your conversations with each other. Your calls home to your family. We hear it all. We draw conclusions. We know who you are. Therefore, I offer you a choice. On behalf of the Ukrainian people, I give you a chance. Chance to survive. If you surrender to our forces, we will treat you the way people are supposed to be treated. As people, decently. In a way you were not treated in your army. And in a way your army does not treat ours. Choose! Our brave defenders continue to inflict devastating losses on Russian troops. Soon the number of downed helicopters of Russia will reach hundreds of units. They have already lost 80 warplanes. Hundreds of tanks and thousands of other units of equipment. In 19 days, the Russian army has lost more in Ukraine than in two bloody and years-long wars in Chechnya. For what? I am grateful to those Russians who do not stop trying to convey the truth. To those who fight disinformation and tell the truth, real facts to their friends and loved ones. And personally to the woman who entered the studio of Channel One with a poster against the war. To those who are not afraid to protest. As long as your country has not completely closed itself off from the whole world, turning into a very large North Korea, you must fight. You must not lose your chance. The European Union has approved the fourth package of sanctions against Russia. The fourth - and I'm sure not the last. We are working with partners on new restrictions that will be applied against the Russian state. Everyone who is responsible for the war. Everyone who is responsible for the destruction of democracy. Everyone who is responsible for repression against people. Everyone will get an answer. The answer of the world. And this is just the beginning. Responsibility for war crimes of the Russian military is inevitable. Responsibility for a deliberate humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities is inevitable. The whole world sees what is happening in Mariupol. Kharkiv. Chernihiv. Sumy. Okhtyrka. Hostomel. Irpin. In all our cities. All our partners are informed of the crimes of the invaders against civilians and local self-government in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. In the temporarily occupied areas. There will be an answer for that. Necessarily. For the disrupted humanitarian corridors. Necessarily. During the day of March 14, 3,806 Ukrainians were evacuated from the cities and towns of the Kyiv and Luhansk regions.  Our convoy with one hundred tons of what is most necessary for Mariupol is still kept in Berdyansk. For three days already. But we will try. We will do everything to ensure that Mariupol residents receive food, water and medicine. I provided full information about the actions of the invaders on the Ukrainian land in conversations with friends and partners of our state. Every aggressive action of the invaders only pushes the world to new sanctions. I spoke with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. With President of Poland Andrzej Duda. Prime Minister of Luxembourg Xavier Bettel. We have 100% mutual understanding. The conversation with Prime Minister of Israel Bennett was also important. As part of a negotiation effort to end this war as soon as possible. With a fair peace. Our delegation also worked on this in negotiations with the Russian party. Pretty good, as I was told. But let's see. They will continue tomorrow. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has agreed on a package of decisions to support our economy. So that business works. So that people have jobs. Where security allows. Where people are ready for it. First, we are starting tax reform. Instead of VAT and income tax we give a rate of 2 percent of turnover and simplified accounting. For small businesses - this is the first and second group of sole proprietors - we set a voluntary payment of a single tax. That is, if you can - pay. You can't - no questions asked. The second is maximum business deregulation. We cancel all inspections for all businesses. So that everyone works normally. So that the cities come to life. So that life continues wherever there is no hostilities. The only condition is that you ensure the normal operation of your business in the framework of Ukrainian law. These are just the first two steps of our tax reform. To be continued. And finally. I have just signed a decree on awarding state awards of Ukraine to 234 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who showed personal courage and heroism in the fight for our land. For our independence. 59 of them posthumously. May the memory of everyone who gave life for our state live forever! Eternal gratitude to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"
"Today, volunteers are all those who feel a free call to defend Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-03-14T14:24:00Z,"I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! Good weather, which we now almost do not notice. Clear sky... There is no such thing over Kyiv today. Over Kyiv and other cities of our state. Due to missile strikes, traces of enemy aircraft. The streets are quiet, but I know, I believe it's not for long. Not forever. That's why we work. That is why we fight. That's why we don't give what's ours. Today we celebrate our purely Ukrainian holiday. Volunteer Day. It is our ability to instantly unite during ordeals, find common ground and fight together that creates our character, Ukrainian character. We may not notice each other in everyday life. Agree, this happens to us. But when we see a threat to our way of life, to our spirit, when we see a threat to Ukraine, our state, we do not hesitate even for a moment. If we are Ukrainians. We unite. We do everything to protect what’s ours. Ukrainians do not need to be persuaded to become volunteers. Ukrainians do not need to be encouraged to start helping each other. Strong support for the Armed Forces by all the people of Ukraine, sincere volunteer movement, mass joining the territorial defense, solidarity of all our people - these are the prerequisites for victory. Prerequisites for the liberation of our entire country... The only and the best. For us, Ukraine is not just a territory, as for the invaders. They do not distinguish anything here. They do not understand anything. That is why for them everything is just a target. For us, Ukraine is millions of happy moments, native symbols, memorable places. We feel this land. For us, Ukraine is our life, and that is why millions of people have come to the defense of our state today. That is why today we are all volunteers. All those who defend Ukraine, our children, those who defend our future. To all who feel this free call... A call to defend Ukraine... Who are volunteers in battles. Or in the information troops. Who protects roads and cities. All diplomats - official and informal. Everyone who helps with technology. Who keeps the business. Who supplies the necessary goods, products. Who saves and heals under any circumstances. Who works in transport. Who provides communication and repairs networks... I am grateful to everyone. And I sincerely congratulate you! Each of the volunteers. Each of the millions working together to win. The 19th day of our resistance. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are holding on bravely. And creatively. We inflict such losses on the enemy that he no longer knows where else to look for reserves. Where else to look for help. Help for himself. Help for the invader. This is pathetic. But we have no right to relax. The Russian state has been preparing for war for decades. They have accumulated significant military resources. For the evil. For the conquest of neighbors. And for the destruction of Ukraine, Europe, as we know it, as we value it. That's why we have to hold on. We have to fight. To win. To come to the peace deserved by Ukrainians. Fair peace. With security guarantees for our state. For our people. And to put it on paper. In negotiations. Difficult negotiations. The video meeting of the delegations has already started today. It continues. Everyone is waiting for the news. We will definitely report in the evening. As long as the state is at war, as long as the people are defending themselves, the economy must be preserved and restored. As much as possible in the current difficult conditions. Life must appear on the streets of the cities. Where security allows. Where people can provide it. Pharmacies, trade, any business that can work. For the country to live. For the restoration of Ukraine to already begin. And it depends on each of us, on each of us who is able to work. Economic suppression of Ukraine is one of the tasks of the war against us. And we have to fight back from that as well. Save our economy. Save our people. Therefore, the government has received a clear instruction - to return small and medium-sized businesses. Remove any obstacles. Reduce taxes as much as possible, remove all difficulties, absolutely all. So that the system does not press, so that people know that they can work the way they can. Where they can. A new tax model is needed for the war and for the post-war development. The financial rules also need to be updated. To make people feel that they can be flexible. Feel that all the money and valuables will be saved. And that you shouldn’t be afraid of losing something, because the state guarantees the security of assets and savings. The Cabinet of Ministers is already working on how to regulate this. A day or two - and there will be details. Ukrainians! Russian troops continue to destroy our infrastructure, continue to destroy our cities. Kyiv region, Chernihiv region, Sumy region, Kharkiv, south, Donbas. But know - we will rebuild everything. We will restore everything. Every street of every city. Every house, every apartment of every Ukrainian. After the war, I'm sure we can do it quickly. We will direct all our efforts to this. All the help of the world. We are already creating funds for Ukraine to live. But now that the invaders are still on our land, we must beat them as best as we can. Drive them away in any way we can. Defend the cities. Defend the villages. Defend every meter of our land. And every part of our heart. Ukrainian heart. Ukrainian soul. Help each other! Support each other! Support the defense! And protect the state! Together we will definitely win. Glory to Ukraine!"
Andriy Yermak held a meeting to protect the rights of Ukrainians who have temporarily left their homeland due to Russian aggression,2022-03-14T12:23:00Z,"The meeting was chaired by Head of the Office of the President Andriy Yermak with the participation of the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ambassadors of Ukraine to foreign countries. The event was dedicated to the protection of the rights of Ukrainian citizens who have temporarily left their homeland due to Russian aggression. The attendees heard reports from the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and ambassadors to Ukraine's neighboring countries who spoke about the current situation. Particular attention was paid to the social protection of temporarily displaced citizens of our country during their stay in other countries, as well as strengthening the work of diplomatic missions with Ukrainians who today more than ever need attention and protection. Based on the results of the meeting, the Foreign Ministry will summarize the current problems and propose urgent measures to eliminate them."
Ten humanitarian corridors for evacuation of people in Ukraine were agreed upon on March 14 - Iryna Vereshchuk,2022-03-14T10:35:00Z,"In Ukraine, 10 humanitarian corridors will be opened on March 14 at 9:00 am to evacuate people from settlements affected by shelling by the Russian army. This was announced by Deputy Prime Minister - Minister for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories Iryna Vereshchuk. According to her, a number of evacuation routes are planned in the Kyiv region: From the villages of Bohdanivka and Nova Bohdanivka in the direction of Brovary. The route from the village of Peremoha to the city of Brovary has been agreed upon. From the village of Bobryk in the direction of Brovary. From the city of Hostomel to Bilohorodka. From the villages of Nemishajeve and Vorzel to Bilohorodka. From the village of Dmytrivka to Bilohorodka. In the Luhansk region, according to the Deputy Prime Minister, humanitarian corridors along the following routes have been agreed upon: From the city of Severodonetsk to the city of Slovyansk, Donetsk region. From the city of Popasna, Luhansk region, to the city of Slovyansk, Donetsk region. From the village of Hirske, Luhansk region, to the city of Slovyansk, Donetsk region. ""Also, once again we will try to finally unblock the movement of the humanitarian convoy with food and medicine from the city of Berdyansk through the city of Manhush to the city of Mariupol,"" Iryna Vereshchuk said. The Deputy Prime Minister reminded that mayor of Melitopol Ivan Fedorov remains in captivity of the invaders. The fate of mayor of Dniprorudne Yevhen Matvieyev who was abducted by the enemy is also unknown. ""Rescuer Oleksiy Danchenko remains in captivity. We hope we will be able to get him out of forced detention during the corridor to Hostomel,"" she said."
We will win thanks to our ability to unite and always care for our people - address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-03-14T00:19:00Z,"Strong people of an unbreakable country! Today is the 18th day. The 18th day of our war for life, for Ukraine, for independence. The beginning of this day was black. Russian missiles and air bombs hit our country again. From east to west. 30 missiles for the Lviv region alone. The shelling of the International Center for Peacekeeping and Security killed 35 people and wounded 134 others. Nothing was happening there that could threaten the territory of the Russian Federation. And only 20 kilometers away are NATO borders. Last year, I made a clear warning to NATO leaders that if there were no tough preventive sanctions against Russia, it would start a war. We were right. I have been saying for a long time that Nord Stream is a weapon that will hit Europe. Now it's obvious. And now I repeat again - if you do not close our sky, it is only a matter of time before Russian missiles fall on your territory. NATO territory. On the homes of citizens of NATO countries. An American journalist was killed in the Kyiv region today. Brent Renaud. His colleague was wounded. It was a deliberate attack by the Russian military. They knew what they were doing. But not everyone in the West seems to know what they are doing. In the east of our country, the invaders decided to ""demilitarize"" and ""denazify"" the Sviatohirsk Lavra of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, Moscow Patriarchate. At the time of the attack, only monks and hundreds of refugees were on the territory of the monastery. No military target in or near the monastery. But Russian troops do not stop even before striking at the monastery. This fact alone demonstrates that the whole ideology of the Russian state is simply a lie. Today I visited our guys, our defenders who are recovering from wounds at a military hospital. We talked. I presented awards. Orders and medals - for courage, for glory for Ukraine. And I really want my greeting ""I wish you good health"" to work today as powerfully as our Armed Forces have been holding key frontiers. For 18 days already. By the way, the Russian military from Ryazan is being treated in the same hospital. He is in the same ward with our defenders. Gets the same aid. From the same doctors. Despite what this guy was doing. Against us, against Ukraine. But Ukrainian doctors saved him. And this is obvious. Because they are people. Not savages. And we have to go through this war so that we all remain human. I am grateful to all the doctors and nurses who work in Kyiv and Dnipro, in Vinnytsia and Lviv, in Chernihiv and Donbas, in Kharkiv, in Melitopol, in Mariupol... Everyone! Mariupol Military Hospital. Pokrovsk Military Mobile Hospital. Chasiv Yar Military Mobile Hospital. Military Medical Clinical Center of the Eastern Region. Cherkaske Military Hospital. Military Medical Clinical Center of the Central Region, Vinnytsia. Military Medical Clinical Center of the Western Region, Lviv. Military Medical Rehabilitation Center, left Irpen, but continues to work. Sincere gratitude! From all of us. From all Ukrainians. I also visited checkpoints today. I didn't want it to be very public. Just to support our guys. To talk. Courageous men, cheerful guys. Who defend Kyiv and know that WE will win. It is felt. We will win due to our unique ability to unite. We can always care for our people. Ours in spirit, in heart, in sincerity. I met an extraordinary person there at the checkpoint who supports our defenders every day and brings them a pot of borscht every day. Really delicious! Truly Ukrainian. Wholeheartedly. And I know that our state has been based on such people for centuries. It is thanks to such people that we will survive any dark days. Because we are together. And we always protect our own people. And our own property. NOT for money. Without coercion. NOT like those who came to us. Just because we are Ukrainians. Important international negotiations. Bulgaria, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Romania, Poland, Britain. We feel the support of these countries. We feel the support for our army. It is important. I also spoke with Charles Michel, President of the European Council. About our European perspective, which is becoming a reality. Now about the negotiations with the Russian Federation. Representatives of our countries' delegations speak in video format every day. Our delegation has a clear task - to do everything to ensure a meeting of the presidents. The meeting that I am sure people are waiting for. Obviously this is a difficult story. A hard path. But this path is needed. And our goal is for Ukraine to get the necessary result in this struggle, in this negotiation work. Necessary for peace. And for security. So that we have guarantees - normal, effective. NOT like the Budapest ones and not like in our sky. So that Ukrainians could say: this is what works. These are the guarantees. It is necessary to talk. More than ten humanitarian corridors worked. Kyiv region, Luhansk region... 5550 people were saved in one day. In six days - more than 130,000. It is necessary to talk. And this is also due to negotiations. We have to understand that. Unfortunately, the humanitarian corridor to Mariupol was blocked. Again. We did everything necessary. Ensured ""silence"". Russian troops disrupted the movement of cargo and buses. But we will try again. Until we can help our people. Because they are ours. Our Mariupol. Heroic Mariupol. Ukrainians! We are going through the worst ordeal in our history. In our lives. We protect the most precious thing we have. We must hold on. We must fight. And we will win. I know that. I believe in that. Glory to you! Glory to our people! Glory to our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"
Volodymyr Zelenskyy paid a visit to the wounded defenders of Ukraine,2022-03-13T17:09:00Z,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy paid a visit to the wounded defenders of Ukraine undergoing treatment at a military hospital. The militaries were taken to this medical institution with injuries of varying severity after the fighting in the Kyiv region. The Head of State awarded the militaries with orders and medals for courage and dedication, as well as honored the hospital staff for exemplary work in difficult conditions. Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke with the hospital's management, asked about the needs of the institution and the special measures taken during the war."
Regular evacuation routes were opened in the Kyiv and Luhansk regions - Iryna Vereshchuk,2022-03-13T11:29:00Z,"Regular humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of residents of settlements affected by the shelling were open in Ukraine on March 13 at 9:00. This was announced by Deputy Prime Minister - Minister for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories of Ukraine Iryna Vereshchuk. ""Yesterday, as you remember, a convoy of humanitarian cargo left Zaporizhzhia for Mariupol via Berdyansk. They are now in Berdyansk and moving in the direction of Mariupol. I sincerely hope that I will report on the positive result in the evening,"" she said. According to the Deputy Prime Minister, the following corridors are opening in the Kyiv direction today: 25 evacuation buses will depart from Borodyanka to Zhytomyr (they will arrive in Borodyanka from Piskivka). From the village of Svitylnia in the direction of Brovary, where buses will arrive. The evacuation will take place on the route Svitylnia - Ploske - Hoholiv - Krasylivka - Kvitneve - Brovary. From the village of Peremoha in the direction of the city of Kyiv (Peremoha - Lukyanivka - Lukashi - Korniivka - Nedra - Sadove - Berezan - Boryspil - Kyiv). Buses for evacuation of people will be sent on a route from the city of Kyiv. From the village of Velyka Dymerka in the direction of Brovary, from where buses will be sent. Humanitarian corridors will be open in the Luhansk region as well: From Kreminna to Lyman. Buses to evacuate people will be sent from Bakhmut. From the city of Rubizhne to the city of Slovyansk, Donetsk region (Rubizhne - Severodonetsk - Lysychansk - Slovyansk (via Bakhmut). From the city of Popasna, Luhansk region, to the city of Slovyansk, Donetsk region (Popasna - Bakhmut - Slovyansk). From the village of Hirske, Luhansk region, to the city of Slovyansk, Donetsk region (Hirske - Lysychansk - Bakhmut - Slovyansk). From the city of Shchastya, Luhansk region to the city of Slovyansk, Donetsk region (Shchastya - Novoaydar - Severodonetsk - Lysychansk - Slovyansk). According to Iryna Vereshchuk, shelling is taking place in Severodonetsk. ""We hope that the shelling will be ceased, the ceasefire will be observed and the timely evacuation of people will begin,"" she said. The Deputy Prime Minister also addressed the people who decide to move outside the humanitarian corridors: “Please listen to the information we provide, and if there is an open corridor, look for information about collection points through alerts, through people, because otherwise it will be very dangerous for your life and the lives of your children and loved ones."" Iryna Vereshchuk also called on the Russian side to release SES officer Oleksiy Danchenko, who accompanied the convoy on an agreed humanitarian route in Bilohorodka and is currently in Hostomel. ""We demand the release of Oleksiy Danchenko. We agreed on a humanitarian route, and he performed his duty in accordance with the agreements,"" she said."
We still need to fight and inflict maximum damage on the enemy in all areas of defense - address by the President of Ukraine,2022-03-13T01:01:00Z,"Wise people of a strong country! The 17th day of the war is over. War for the right to be free. For the right to live on our land the way we, Ukrainians, want it. Not the way someone came up with for us. And against us. Against our nature. Against our character. The Russian invaders cannot conquer us. They do not have such strength. They do not have such spirit. They are holding only on violence. Only on terror. Only on weapons, which they have a lot. But the invaders have no natural basis for normal life. So that people can feel happy and dream. They are organically incapable of making life normal! Wherever Russia has come to a foreign land, dreams are impossible. Only a very hard struggle for survival. As a result of the attack on our land, on Ukraine, the Russian leadership is actually turning its state into an analogue of the so-called ""DPR"" and ""LPR"". Into a large area isolated from the rest of the world. Where poverty will reign. Where everything will be determined only by violence. And where people will flee. In any manner they can and whoever can. Look who is leaving Russia now. Who withdraws business. These are professionals who can be competitive at the global market. These are IT specialists who do not want to live in an area where there is no freedom. These are businessmen who feel that everything will be taken away from them at any moment. These are artists who know that creativity in a territory where human life is worthless is also worthless. Russia loses its brains. Loses talent. Loses money. But if this is happening to Russia, then what awaits the so-called ""DPR"" and ""LPR""? Their analogues? Solely complete degradation. The invaders in the Kherson region are trying to repeat the notorious experience of the formation of pseudo-republics. Blackmail local leaders, put pressure on deputies. Look for someone to bribe. They're trying to organize the so-called ""KPR"". Stillborn as ""DPR"" and ""LPR"". To organize some ""committees"" against the legitimate government on our land. And against the will of the people who go out to protest every day. And who want Ukraine. I am grateful to them. I want to tell some figures who lacked the disgust to refuse to talk to the invaders... I want to say - if some of them were suddenly tempted by proposals from the invaders... You sign your sentence. The sentence is to follow more than 12,000 invaders who failed to understand in time why Ukraine should not be encroached upon. An emergency meeting of the Kherson Regional Council took place. 44 deputies decided that the Kherson region is Ukraine, and no pseudo-republics have a place there. Ukraine will stand the test. We need time and strength to break the military machine that came to our land. I will not underestimate the threat. And I will not exaggerate the achievements. We are honest people, not Russia's Ministry of Defense. Which lies to everyone - millions of its citizens and even the head of the Russian Federation. So I say frankly: we still need to hold on. We still have to fight. Every day and every night we must look for ways to cause maximum damage to the enemy. In all areas of defense. Near Zhytomyr and Kyiv, near Chernihiv and Sumy, near Kharkiv and Luhansk, near Donetsk and Mariupol, in the south of the country and on the diplomatic frontline. Having such tactics and having self-confidence, we will regain what’s ours. We will come to Melitopol and Henichesk. We will come wherever our land is. And let the invaders know. Let all the collaborators they find know. That Ukraine will not forgive them. Nobody. Nothing. Ukraine will not forget. Ukraine will find and prosecute. Every single one. In any possible way. By the way, all humanitarian corridors, which were agreed upon, worked. 12,729 people were evacuated. The humanitarian cargo for Mariupol is to arrive tomorrow afternoon. Due to the complexity of the route they had to spend the night in Berdyansk. On every occasion, I constantly repeat to our friends and partners abroad that they should do more for Ukraine, for Ukrainians. Because it is not only for Ukraine. This is for everyone in Europe. Evil that purposefully bombs peaceful cities... Evil that fires even at ambulances and blows up hospitals will not be able to stop at one country. If it has the strength to go further. I said this at a very important rally in support of our people, which was organized in Europe. More than a hundred thousand people in the squares of Italy and other countries of the continent gathered for a rally in support of Ukraine and against Russian aggression. Millions of people heard my appeal later thanks to broadcasts and recordings. We now enjoy the greatest support in the history of Ukraine for our aspirations and our independence. You can take a public opinion poll in any country and you will see that Ukraine is among the leaders of those who are sympathized with and supported. And Russia is not just among enemies. It is even a bigger enemy, bigger evil than North Korea. That's what Americans think, for example. Ordinary people in all states. As well as ordinary people in all European countries. And I am grateful to them for this extraordinary support. Grateful for understanding our struggle. Because we are united by one dream - to live freely on our land. And we have the right to what everyone has in the free world. To a safe sky, as well as to our own land. Dear Ukrainians! Our heroes!  The world has always loved those who fight against evil. It was our resistance, the courage of all our people that inspired the world. Millions of people in different countries. Who 17 days ago might not have felt what they all have in common. We all have. And now it's obvious. Peace. Freedom. And love for our children. The children we are fighting for. For them to have a future. I signed two important decrees. On awarding 106 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who bravely showed themselves in the battles for the independence of Ukraine. 17 of them, unfortunately, posthumously. But they are heroes. I - the decree on conferring the title of Hero of Ukraine with the award of the Order of the Golden Star to: Senior Sergeant Vasich Serhiy Viktorovych. Posthumously. He bravely defended our positions in the Kyiv region. Destroyed enemy equipment and a significant amount of enemy manpower. Senior soldier Parkhomuk Vitaliy Vasyliovych. Posthumously. During the counterattack on the enemy near the city of Makariv, he inflicted significant losses on the enemy and died heroically defending his brothers-in-arms. Soldier Mrochko Kostiantyn Vasyliovych. Posthumously. He fought bravely against the overwhelming forces of the enemy. Thanks to his effective actions, the invaders suffered painful losses. Soldier Svynchuk Oleh Anatoliyovych. Posthumously. He heroically performed his duty in the battle against the overwhelming forces of the enemy. He was helping his brothers-in-arms until the last moment. Sergeant Khanin Andriy Pavlovych. Posthumously. Defending Volnovakha, Donetsk region, he destroyed an enemy tank and about 10 enemies. During the battle, when he was wounded, he helped his wounded brothers-in-arms and performed his duty to the last. Sergeant Derusova Inna Mykolaivna. Posthumously. Since February 24, the senior combat medic has performed tasks in the city of Okhtyrka, Sumy region. She saved more than 10 servicemen, risking her own life. She died from artillery shelling by Russian troops, helping the wounded. The first woman - hero of Ukraine, who was posthumously awarded this title. Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! The title of Hero of Ukraine with the Order of the Golden Star is conferred upon: Senior Lieutenant Hutsul Volodymyr Oleksandrovych. Thanks to his heroic actions in the Kherson region, 25 units of enemy equipment and about 300 invaders were destroyed. Senior Lieutenant Chornyi Volodymyr Volodymyrovych. Thanks to his skilful actions during the defense of Volnovakha, Donetsk region, about 50 enemies and a T-72 tank were destroyed, as well as 5 invaders were captured. Glory to all heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"
Address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Italians and all Europeans,2022-03-12T19:21:00Z,"Greetings to all friends of Ukraine! Greetings to all friends of Europe, all friends of freedom! I know that there are over a hundred thousand of you all over the world today. More than a hundred thousand in the squares of different cities. We, Ukrainians, are grateful for this. And now I ask each of you to remember one number in each square... 79. You will understand what this means. I will tell you now what it means for our lives, for each of us. I will tell all one hundred thousand and millions who will hear us afterwards. We are experiencing a terrible war in Ukraine. Europe has not seen such a war since World War II. We did not start this war. This is a brutal and cynical Russian invasion of Ukrainian land. This is a war against the Ukrainian people - against peaceful and sincere people, whom I am sure you have known very well during the years of our independence. And you saw that we are very similar to you. We equally value freedom. We equally value equality. We equally want to live. We just want to live. We equally want only the best, the brightest for our children, for our families. But now we and you live differently. Now when the war is going on and thousands of people have died in it! And 79 children have died in it. 79 children! I'm sure each of you has photos of your loved ones. At home or just on the phone so you can watch when your heart asks for that. Photos of children, photos of parents. Photos of your loved ones. We don't even realize it, but we always know that these photos are not the last. Because we believe that we will see how those who are dearest to us will live. We'll see how happy our loved ones are. How our children grow up, how they go to university, how they work. How they have their children. And then we will play with our grandchildren. Meet them after school, have dinner together. Everyone in the millions lives with that hope. Hope for a truly peaceful life. For new photos, new memories, new moments of happiness, which our state, Ukraine, is deprived of now. While the war continues, we are in fundamentally different conditions with you. When you can be sure that you and your loved ones have a long future ahead, a normal future. And we want that. And we are happy for you. And for us, what we have may be the last time. Just one last time. Today and never again. As for 79 Ukrainian children. 79 Ukrainian families. Destroyed by this shameful war - the invasion of Russia. 79 families who have lost the most valuable, but who are still forced to fight. They are forced to pull themselves up and survive. And fight. Fight for a future that is over for them. In those photos of 79 children killed in the war. And what should we do... All of us - the Ukrainian people, Europeans - so that this number 79 does not change, does not grow. And so that Europe does not forget Ukraine-79. Russian troops besiege Ukrainian cities. They are trying to destroy them. Imagine! Entire cities! In 2022! In Europe. Our Mariupol, the largest Ukrainian city on the coast of the Sea of Azov, is under complete blockade. It is bombed around the clock. Russian troops drop air bombs on it and fire missiles. They even bombed a maternity hospital and a children’s hospital in Mariupol... This is hatred of all mankind. They kill children and destroy maternity hospitals and children's hospitals. Why? So that Ukrainian women don't even give birth? And this is all over our country, all over Ukraine, which is suffering from the Russian invasion. They have already destroyed dozens of hospitals, hundreds of schools and kindergartens. They are destroying universities. Completely destroying residential areas with carpet bombing. Imagine what it is! And how to survive in this? What does it mean for Ukrainians, for our families, for our children? What does it mean when you can't find peace even in church. Because aviation bombs even churches! Even squares... The same squares as yours... Where you are listening to me now. They bombed the square in our city of Kharkiv - Freedom Square. This is the largest square in Europe, which is no different from your squares. Except that it is destroyed. Destroyed by a Russian missile strike. I am constantly asked in interviews: how can Europe help Ukraine? I formulate the question differently, namely: how can Europe help itself? Because this is a war not only against our people, not only against Ukrainians. This is a war against the values that unite us. Against our ability to live. Live, not kill like the Russian military on our land. Do you feel why we are different from them? We live. And they kill. We are 79 lives. And they are 79 deaths. I am sure that you want to stop the war just like every Ukrainian. That is why my answer about the help that is needed for Ukraine sounds logical, natural to millions of people in democracies. You need to put pressure. Such sanctions against Russia are needed so that every Russian soldier knows the price of every shot at civilians. We need such principles of European business that the Russian state does not have the money to ruin lives. Put pressure on the companies in your countries to leave Russia, so that you are not indirect sponsors of this war and tragedy. Tell your politicians to close the sky over Ukraine from Russian missiles and planes. From those who killed 79 children and thousands of adults! Thousands in 17 days... All this will protect us. We are just like you. Absolutely the same! You know that. You feel it. You see me and you understand all this. And you know that we must be together in the European community. This is extremely important for Ukraine. And this is very important for you, for Europe. Because this will strengthen Europe. This will protect Europe. This will stop the war forever. This will prove that the 79 lives taken in the war for freedom have not been lost in vain. That they are alive. That they live among us. And they are among other children of Ukraine and Europe, who will be able to be free, will be able to dream, will be able to just live as they want. In peace. And not to be afraid that they may be killed. And not to look for the nearest air bomb shelter. Just as you are not looking for it - each of the hundred thousand in the squares of European cities that are listening to me now. And just as millions who, I'm sure, will hear me. Hear about Ukraine-79. About Ukraine-2022. About Ukraine, which seeks peace. And about Europe, for which it is time to choose. Choose Ukraine. For the sake of peace! For the sake of all of us. Glory to Ukraine!"
Ukraine and its citizens deserved to be in the EU - Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-03-12T18:33:00Z,"Promoting Ukraine's membership in the European Union is one of the important means of support for our state by European countries. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a meeting with representatives of foreign media in Kyiv. ""We believe we deserved to be in the European Union. We do not need promises. We need concrete support. The best thing the government, its prime minister, can do, if we are not speaking of weapons, but speaking in the context of the EU, which also motivates us, is to say specifically that he or she stands for Ukraine being a member of the EU,"" the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that it is important for Ukraine to get an answer to this question right now. ""For what reasons, why, when - no one is interested in that. We have a war today, we want to hear the answers to all the questions we ask the world today,"" he said. The President also stressed the importance of all EU member states speaking out as regards this issue. “If the European Union says “yes”, then it is necessary to say “yes” specifically and everyone should say that. Do not balance between the raindrops of diplomacy, because you will be completely under the rain,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy is convinced. The Head of State noted that even in spite of the circumstances in which our state has found itself due to Russia's invasion, not all EU countries agree that Ukraine's accession to the European Union should be considered. ""I believe that Ukraine is a worthy country. And the most important thing is people. Our people have shown that they are brave, strong, European, that they will not leave anyone in trouble, which is important. They proved that they can fight. I think this only strengthens the European Union,"" said the President."
"Russia is already moving away from ultimatums, but full-fledged talks require the participation of Western partners - Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-03-12T18:00:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasizes that it is impossible to occupy the Ukrainian people, so the war that Russia started against our country will inevitably end in our victory - it is only a matter of time. The Head of State said this during a meeting with representatives of foreign media. ""We know 100% there will be a victory, and we do not know 100% when it will be. Our diplomats are working and talking about some details of the agenda that may be between Ukraine and the Russian Federation. I would like this to happen, and it would be a real, in practice, not verbal, settlement process. The process of peace, the process of ending the war,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. According to the President, at the beginning of the negotiation process to end the war, Russia often put forward ultimatums, which Ukraine did not agree to, and hostilities intensified. But today, instead of ultimatums, the conversation begins. And this is a fundamentally different approach. ""We see that the rapid operation - three or four days - did not happen. The occupation of our state, the change of leadership of our state, the change of the flag of our state did not happen. I am sure this will not happen. And even if a million Russian citizens are brought here to die, it is impossible to occupy Ukrainians. It is possible to occupy, block all cities, cover Ukraine with corpses of the Russian military, but it is impossible to occupy the mind of our people,"" the Head of State is convinced. At the same time, the President stands for more active involvement of Western partners and leaders of Western countries in the negotiation process. ""Because when we talk about the points of guaranteeing the security of our state, after such a bloody war, Ukrainians simply will not be able to trust Russia. Therefore, in addition to the Russian Federation, these security guarantees must be offered by other leaders,"" he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that some of the leaders were informed about the issues that are being discussed between the Ukrainian and Russian sides. The President believes that a ceasefire should be the beginning of negotiations to end the war. This, in particular, will unblock humanitarian processes: the evacuation of people affected by hostilities in the settlements, as well as the delivery of food, water and medicine. ""This is the correct human, diplomatic signal, from which the end of the war always begins in all normal, civilized times,"" he added. The Head of State stressed the importance of receiving a signal from Russia on readiness for dialogue, which has not been the case in recent years. ""I think I held hundreds of talks with the leaders of other countries, giving them every opportunity to be negotiators, mediators, anyone, just to organize a meeting. You should know that all these thousands of people have died because Russia has never confirmed the possibility of a meeting. And this is their absolute responsibility, completely,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Answering the question about the theoretical possibility of Russian troops entering the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, the President said that if tens or hundreds of thousands of troops currently being mobilized by Russia could come with hundreds or thousands of tanks, these troops could enter Kyiv. ""If they carry out a carpet bombing and simply decide to erase the historical memory of the whole region, the history of Kyivan Rus', the history of Europe, they will enter Kyiv. If they destroy all of us, they will enter Kyiv. If this is the goal, they will enter and will have to live on this land alone, without us. They will not find friends among us here,"" the Head of State said."
It is time to be effective in routine affairs and provide everything necessary for the defense - address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-03-12T13:46:00Z,"Brave people of the unconquered country! From the very morning in the Ukrainian - forever Ukrainian - Melitopol people, our citizens, gathered for the regular protest action against the Russian troops. Against the attempts to put the city to its knees. More than two thousand people in the square. Do you hear it, Moscow? If 2,000 people are protesting against the occupation in Melitopol, how many people should be in Moscow against the war? To make it fair. Yesterday the invaders captured the mayor of Melitopol Ivan Fedorov. The city community is demanding his release. And this is very important. I am grateful to every Melitopol resident for this resistance, for this position. The invaders must see that they are strangers on our land, on all our land of Ukraine, and they will never be accepted. Throughout the night and today we constantly talk to our partners about this situation with our mayor. The demand is simple - to release him from captivity immediately. We appeal to all world leaders who speak to Moscow. France, Germany, Israel and others. I have personally called German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. I spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron. I will talk to everyone to free our people. We expect them, the world leaders, to show how they can influence the situation. How they can do a simple thing - free one person. A person who represents the entire Melitopol community, Ukrainians who do not give up. Our Armed Forces are doing everything to deprive the enemy of any desire to continue the war against Ukraine. The losses of Russian troops are enormous. The dynamics of the invaders' losses on the 17th day is such that it is safe to say that this is the biggest blow to the Russian army in decades. They’ve never lost more than that in such a time period. Since the beginning of the invasion, 31 battalion tactical groups of the enemy have lost their combat capability. The Russian militaries are being taken prisoners not just alone, but in groups. Groups are trying to leave Ukraine and come back to Russia as well. The losses of the invaders in technical capabilities are simply astounding. More than 360 tanks. 1205 armored vehicles. And that's without counting the losses in the battles this night and in the morning. Already almost 60 planes. More than 80 helicopters. Hundreds and hundreds of units of other equipment, including the most modern models, of which Russia is proud. Most of the world's armies do not have as much as Russian troops lost during the invasion. Ukrainians! I want you to understand me correctly. We have had extraordinary success. The resistance of the entire Ukrainian people against these invaders has already gone down in history. But we have no right to reduce the intensity of defense. No matter how difficult it is. We have no right to reduce the energy of resistance. The enemy is bringing new and new columns to the territory of Ukraine. They are looking everywhere for fighters. Reservists. Conscripts. Mercenaries. They are trying to take us with numbers. The number of fighters, the number of equipment. They use terror to break our faith in victory and in Ukraine. I'm sure they won't succeed. It will not work for them. But in order for them not to succeed, we still have to fight. We still need to be focused. All of us, all Ukrainians, still need to continue to focus on defense. Work together. Without internal split. Supporting each other. All over the country. From Uzhhorod to Melitopol. From Chernihiv to Mariupol. From Lviv to Kharkiv. Just like we all have been doing for 17 days of the war. Today we again sent humanitarian aid to Mariupol. We will try every day to save our people. I am grateful to every driver who tries to accomplish this difficult mission. I am grateful to the representatives of the church who joined the efforts to protect the humanitarian corridor in Mariupol from shelling. Ukrainian troops, for their part, guarantee complete ""silence"" along the entire route so that Mariupol receives food, water and medicine. And so that the civilians of Mariupol can go to a safe area. Humanitarian corridors from Makariv, Borodyanka, Trostyanets, Sumy, Poltava, Lebedyn, Konotop, Velyka Pysarivka, Krasnopillya, Polohy, Tokmak, Hostomel, Kozarovychi, Mykulychi and Andriivka of the Kyiv region have also been prepared. The Russian side must ensure ""silence"" on each of these routes. Otherwise, what can Russia guarantee in any negotiations? We continue to work with Europeans in two directions. The first is Ukraine's accession to the European Union. We are working with the European Commission to agree on all procedures for our movement towards the EU as soon as possible. The second direction is sanctions, it is the top priority. We look forward to a new package of European sanctions against Russia to force it to peace. To make it clear: their economy simply will not survive this war. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has made several very important decisions. The complete abolition of value added tax and excise duty for fuel was approved. For gasoline, for diesel. This is done not only in the context of the sowing campaign, which should start as usual, but also in the context of the needs of all citizens. So that there is no shortage of fuel in the country. So that prices are stable. The government has done its part. Now it's up to the deputies. They must immediately adopt this decision by their vote. Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Ruslan Stefanchuk is already organizing the relevant sitting. The second component is to support those Ukrainian communities that receive our migrants from the areas of hostilities. The government has decided to compensate local budgets for utilities payment when accommodating people. According to preliminary estimates, communities in at least ten regions of Ukraine will receive concrete money from the central government to ensure that all IDPs are provided with everything necessary. Ukrainians! Now all of us have to be efficient in our routine as well. We must do our job one hundred percent, help colleagues, take care of our loved ones. And at the same time we must provide everything necessary for our defense. For our defenders. This is a patriotic war. This is a people's war. This is a war for our independence. Independence of not just our state. But of everything Ukrainian that was, is and will be in the world. Glory to Ukraine!"

"Today, everyone is gaining glory for Ukraine in his or her place - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-03-12T00:46:00Z,"Strong people of the steel country! This is how the militaries answer the Kremlin command's question about what prevented them from capturing Ukraine in four days. Strong people of the steel country. This information is unverified, but this fact is indisputable. And if the lost invaders justify their failures with something else, it means that during the 16 days of the war they did not understand anything. Well, we don't take it so hard. We are ready to explain. Enlighten the invaders until they fully understand who they are and where exactly they should go. Go out of Ukraine. Today in Melitopol the invaders captured mayor of the city Ivan Fedorov. A mayor who courageously defends Ukraine and the people of his community. Obviously, this is a sign of the weakness of the invaders. They did not find any support on our land. Although they counted on it. Because for years they have been lying to themselves that people in Ukraine were supposedly waiting for Russia to come. They did not find collaborators who would hand over the city and the power to the invaders. Therefore, they have switched to a new stage of terror, when they are trying to physically eliminate representatives of the legitimate local Ukrainian authorities. It is clear to any democratic state in the world that a legitimately elected mayor is a true representative of the people. Usually it's not about ideology, it's not about politics, it's about the lives of people in a particular community. Probably Russia has become accustomed to this during the years of autocratic rule. Perhaps they believe that the mayor is just a boss which is easy to remove, and it means nothing. But it is Ukraine here. It is Europe here. It is a democratic world here. Therefore, the capture of the mayor of Melitopol is a crime not only against a particular person. Not only against a particular community. And not only against Ukraine. This is a crime against democracy as such. I assure you that one hundred percent of people in all democracies will know this. The actions of the Russian invaders will be equated with the actions of ISIS terrorists. The whole country saw that Melitopol did not surrender to the invaders. Just as Kherson, Berdyansk and other cities where Russian troops managed to enter didn’t. Temporarily managed to enter. And this will NOT be changed by putting pressure on mayors or kidnapping mayors. This can only get worse. For the invaders. Ukraine demands the immediate release of the mayor of Melitopol and guarantees of full security to all heads of communities across the country. If you are becoming an analogue of ISIS terrorists, then what is the point of talking to you about something at all? We will raise this issue, including in talks with international mediators who communicate with Moscow. Today, Russian troops also disrupted the work of most humanitarian corridors. But, despite everything, 7,144 people were saved. From Enerhodar, Bucha, Hostomel and Kozarovychi. And these are 7,144 reasons to try to organize evacuation for Ukrainians from the besieged cities tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. We will do that. We will do everything to bring humanitarian aid to Ukrainian cities. I have to say this with pain - Mariupol remains blocked by the enemy. Russian troops did not let our aid into the city and continue to torture our people, our Mariupol residents. Tomorrow we'll try again. Once again send food, water and medicine for our city. I am confident that the Armed Forces of Ukraine will respond to every minute of our people's suffering. And it's not pathos. Not a threat. This is a statement of reality. The number of killed Russian servicemen on the territory of Ukraine already exceeds 12 thousand people. 12 thousand! The number of wounded invaders is many times bigger. We did not invite any of them here. And we repeat to each of the invaders: you can still save yourself. At any moment. Just lay down your weapons and go home, leave our land. The number of captured invaders has already reached such a level that this issue cannot be left to the structures that we had before the war. Therefore, today the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine established the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War. Thousands of enemy soldiers who have been captured or surrendered receive from our state the treatment required by international conventions. But there are so many of them that a special structure is needed to deal with all related issues. I want to say it again for Russian mothers. Especially for mothers of conscripts. Do not send your children to war in a foreign land. Do not believe the promises that they will be sent just somewhere for exercises or just somewhere in non-combat conditions. Check where your son is. And if you have even the slightest suspicion that your son may be sent to the war against Ukraine, act immediately. Do not give your son to death or captivity. Ukraine never wanted this dreadful war. And Ukraine doesn’t want it. But it will defend as much as necessary. Fortunately, we are not alone in this battle. Ukrainians have sincere friends. Good partners. Speaking in the Polish Parliament today, I paid a lot of attention to the importance of not being alone in today's world. How important it is to protect common values. And as a result - to feel that the borders between nations are blurred. To make people closer. Just like our relationship with Polish brothers and sisters. Just like our relationship with all our sincere partners. Because the one who has friends can do anything. I held talks with US President Biden. We discussed how else we can put pressure on Russia to end this war and establish peace. Russia will be deprived of the opportunity to trade normally with the G7 countries. The less dollars Russian business earns and the less taxes the Russian state receives, the less opportunity the Russian military will have to kill our people. Leading international companies are already leaving the Russian market. The Russian government has put its country outside the global world by starting a war against us. By starting this invasion. This is self-closure. Self-humiliation. Self-destruction. In Moscow currency exchange offices, the dollar has already reached 200 rubles. And this is just the beginning. The beginning of international sanctions. The next step is the United States’ ban on bringing dollars into Russia. Consequently, there will be a shortage of currency. So, the course will raise even more. Consequently, prices will rise. Consequently, every citizen of Russia will feel that the absence of peace is a threat to him personally. Not a single country in the world wished harm to ordinary citizens of Russia. Nobody tried to cause any damage until your government started a war with neighbors, peaceful people. A war of annihilation. No one wanted to return ordinary Russian life back to the ""wicked 1990s"". Is that what you call that era? A time of upheaval and poverty. A time of very limited opportunities for ordinary people and very large inequalities. Perhaps now, due to the efforts of propagandists, most Russians do not yet understand what awaits them. But the Russian authorities ALREADY understand this very well. Very clear. And they are very afraid. That is why they are trying to close all free sources of information. Actually all sources of information. Even Instagram and Facebook. But the modern world has learned to deal with such censorship. My advice to thinking Russians is to look for ways to get truthful information. And try to hide your smartphones and computers from the security forces on the streets. They're getting ready to check what's in people's phones. What do people have in laptops. I specifically warn you: learn to resist the repression that your government plans to increase. Because thinking people should be in every country. And in Russia, too. And they are in Russia. And one more thing. Now the good news and the victories of Ukraine for all of us are worth their weight in gold. Or silver and bronze. And all this - for Ukraine - is successfully won by our Paralympians in Beijing. Today, everyone is gaining glory for Ukraine. In his or her place. Shows the world who Ukrainians are and what strength we have. With a weapon in hands on the battlefield or with a sporting rifle on a biathlon track. Our boys and girls have already won 25 medals at the Winter Paralympics! And take second place in the overall standings, second only to the hosts of the competition - China. The Paralympics will end in two days. I would very much like to say the same about the war. That it will end in two days. Unfortunately, this is still unrealistic. But it will definitely happen. Both victory for Ukraine and peace for Ukraine are achievable. And they will be more valuable for us than gold, silver and bronze of the whole world. Well, for now ... Hold our ground! Hold on! We will win! Glory to Ukraine!"
Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Sejm of the Republic of Poland,2022-03-11T19:26:00Z,"Dear Mr. President, my friend Andrzej! Dear Mrs. Marshal of the Sejm! Dear Mr. Marshal of the Senate! Ladies and gentlemen deputies and senators! Dear Sirs! Polish brothers and sisters! When I became President in 2019, it felt like we had a long way to go with Poland. Because our relationship was pretty cold, our attitude towards each other wasn't too warm. This was the situation. But I wanted to go this way fast. The path to warmth. Because we are such nations. I knew that we were akin by nature - Ukrainians, Poles. I remember my first meetings with Andrzej Duda. From meeting to meeting everything changed. The coolness disappeared. We understood each other. As a Ukrainian and a Pole. As Europeans. As friends. As parents who love their families and realize that our children must live in a world of equal good values. Our shared values. They must live in a world where nations are independent, where freedom reigns, where the family matters, and where no one ever has the right to war, to invasion. It is believed that the number seven brings happiness. That is how many neighbors God has given to Ukraine. Does it bring us happiness? The whole world knows the answer today. And 78 Ukrainian children who died from rockets and shelling of the Russian Federation know it better than others. A neighbor who brought trouble and war to our land. A neighbor who obviously acts without God. When there is someone who beats like a savage, it is very important to have someone who will lend a hand. And when the foot of the enemy enters your house, he will lend you a helping hand. On the morning of February 24, I had no doubt who it would be. Who will say to me: ""Brother, your people will not be left alone with the enemy."" And so it happened. And I'm grateful for that. Polish brothers and sisters are with us. And this is natural. Just in one day, on the first day of the war, it became clear to me and to all Ukrainians, and, I am sure, to all Poles that there are no more borders between us, between our nations. No physical ones. No historical ones. No personal ones. During the 16 days of this war, Ukrainian pride and Polish honor, Ukrainian courage in battles and Polish sincerity in helping us allow me to say very important words now. Words that there is real peace between our nations. Peace between relatives. Peace between brothers. And now I really want these words to be heard by our common Belarusian neighbors. Peace between relatives, peace between neighbors, peace between brothers. We have to come to this with them as well! We will definitely come! Dear Sirs! Polish brothers and sisters! For a long time, various ""stakeholders"" tried to create an impression that Ukrainians and Poles live differently. And separately. Why did they do all this? I will recall the words of President of the Republic of Poland Lech Kaczyński said in Tbilisi in 2008: ""We know very well: today - Georgia, tomorrow - Ukraine, the day after tomorrow - the Baltic countries and then, perhaps, the time will come for my country - Poland”. On February 24, this terrible ""tomorrow"" for Ukraine came, which President Kaczyński spoke about. And today we are fighting for such a bad time for Poland and the Baltic States to never come. We fight together. We have strength. Remember, there are 90 million of us together! We can do everything together. And this is the historical mission, the historical mission of Poland, the historical mission of Ukraine to be leaders who together will pull Europe out of this abyss, save it from this threat, stop the transformation of Europe into a victim. Dear Sirs! We can do it. We saw yesterday what the countries of the European Union talked about and in what manner. We saw who was the real leader and fought for a strong Europe. For common European security. And who tried to stop us, tried to stop you. We understand why it is so important for Poles to fight with us. Together with all those who are for freedom. For us and for you, for Europe. We remember the terrible tragedy of 2010 near Smolensk. We remember all the facts of the investigation into the circumstances of this catastrophe. We feel what this means for you. And what does the silence of those who also know all this mean to you, but... But they still feast their eyes on Russia.   Polish brothers and sisters! I feel that we have already formed an extremely strong alliance. Even though it is informal. But this is an alliance that grew out of reality, not words on paper. Of the warmth in our hearts, not of the speeches of politicians at summits. Of the way you treated our people. Ukrainians who fled to your country to escape from the evil that came to our land. More than one and a half million citizens of Ukraine! The vast majority are women and children. They do not feel like they are in a strange land. You met our people in your families. With Polish delicacy. With fraternal kindness. Although we did not ask for it. And you did not ask anything for it. It's just the way it is between relatives. That's why I address so simply: friend Andrzej, dear Agata! That's why I claim that we have already united. We united to constantly gain and create freedom, as a great Pole, a close friend of Ukraine John Paul II said. Today, I cannot be sure of all the leaders of all European nations, but I am sure that we will definitely be with you in defending freedom. As much as needed. I am grateful for all the help we have already received from your state, from your people. I am grateful for your efforts so that we can secure the Ukrainian sky. I believe that we will be able to achieve the result in this, the result that we all desperately need. If God allows and we win this war, we will share the victory with our brothers and sisters. This is our greatness. And your greatness. This is a struggle for our freedom, this is a struggle for your freedom. This is the common history of great nations! May God help us win!"
"We have already reached a strategic turning point and are moving towards our goal, our victory - President",2022-03-11T14:19:00Z,"Free people of a free country! We have been fighting for our freedom for the 16th day already. This is four times longer than the enemy planned for his invasion. Four times longer! Against the army, which was considered one of the strongest in the world. Which hoped that the Ukrainians would surrender. Hoped that someone would meet Russian flags on Ukrainian streets, on our streets with flowers. But Ukrainians are proud people who always defend their land and will not give the invader a single piece of land. Not a percent of their freedom. 16 days. I know that many people have started to feel tired. I understand. Impatience. I understand. Emotions play a bad game with people. This is life. When we mobilize, when we see our victories and the loss of the enemy on the battlefield, we expect the struggle to end sooner. We expect the invaders to fall faster. But... This is life, this is war. This is a struggle. Time is still needed. Patience is still needed. Our wisdom, energy. The ability to do our job to the maximum so that we can win together. It is impossible to say how many more days we must liberate our Ukrainian land. But it is possible to say - we will do it! Because we strived for that. Because we have already reached a strategic turning point. We are already moving towards our goal, towards our victory. This is a patriotic war. War with a very stubborn enemy who does not pay attention to the thousands of his killed people, killed soldiers. Who is now gathering reservists and conscripts all over Russia to throw them into the hell of this war. Who came up with the idea of throwing mercenaries against our people. Thugs from Syria. From the country that was destroyed in the same way as the invaders are destroying us now - our Mariupol, our Kharkiv, Okhtyrka, Chernihiv, Volnovakha, Izyum, etc. This is how Russian troops treat Ukrainians. This is how they treat Donbas, Russian-speaking people, as they said. How they shouted to everyone about ""protection"", which they talked about so much in Moscow. Rockets, air bombs, artillery. And now Syrian mercenaries who do not distinguish at all who speaks what language here, what church people go to, what party people supported. Mercenaries who simply go to kill in a foreign land - in every sense of the word. Over the past night and morning, the invaders carried out, as they say, ""demilitarization"" of the water supply system in Chernihiv. The city was left without water. We are doing everything to restore the water supply. Due to constant shelling in parts of the Sumy, Kyiv, Donetsk regions there is no electricity, yes, there are problems with heating, no gas, water. This is a humanitarian catastrophe. Humanitarian catastrophe - two words that have become fully synonymous with the other two words - the Russian Federation. At night, the invaders bombed a shoe factory, an apartment building and a kindergarten in Dnipro. For what? How did they threaten the Russian state? They destroyed residential houses in the villages of the Sumy region. They continued torturing Mariupol residents, Kharkiv residents. They fired rockets at Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk... If this continues, sanctions against Russia are not enough. And I expect, we are already working on this, new sanctions from our partners today. Russia must pay for this terrible war. Pay daily! A very important meeting of the leaders of the European Union took place yesterday. Long, substantive. We know what was said at this meeting. What all leaders said. Who specifically spoke. Who supported. Who remained silent. And who tried to make the wording insufficient - for Ukraine, Europe and our common freedom. How do we evaluate the decision made? It's very simple: it must be stronger. This is not what we expect. It is necessary that the decisions of politicians coincide with the mood of their nations, European nations. We are aware of this mood. And they are aware of this mood. Every politician is well aware! The numbers are different in different countries, but there are polls and support is huge. At least 60 percent stand in favor. And this is the vast majority which stands for Ukraine to be part of Europe! Europeans are clearly talking about this. And I'm sure they will clearly tell their politicians about this. If they haven't figured it out yet. The decision of yesterday's meeting of EU leaders now reaches the level of the European Commission. For implementation. For specific procedures. The European Union must do more. It must do more for us, for Ukraine. And for itself. We are waiting for that. All European nations are waiting. Our government officials have organized 12 humanitarian corridors today. Cargo with food, water, medicine is already on the way. Izyum, Enerhodar, Volnovakha, Polohy, Bucha, Hostomel, Borodyanka, Andriivka, Mykulychi, Makariv, Kozarovychi, of course, Mariupol. The Ukrainian servicemen have ensured ""silence"" for the humanitarian corridors to work. If the invaders shoot and disrupt the rescue of people again, they will eventually receive such a response from the world that they themselves will need humanitarian corridors. Our government officials, despite difficulties, are doing everything to ensure that there is fuel, products, medicines and all goods people need throughout the country. Gasoline, diesel - everything is imported. This morning I was asked a question at a daily conference call. Logical question. Given the spring. What about sowing? How to start it, especially in those areas that are temporarily occupied? My answer is very simple: all over our land, no matter what, we have to organize a full-fledged sowing campaign this spring. Of course, as much as possible. It all depends on the people and the situation. Because it's about life. Life is more important. It's about our life. About our dreams. About our future. And therefore, about our victory. I repeat again and again: when we defend freedom, everyone must be like a full-fledged army. Do everything we can in our place to get the result we all deserve. That's fair. To win. Necessarily. Be sure to hold on. Be sure to fight. Be sure to give your all strength. It will not be easy with such a neighbor. But with us, it will not be easy, too. As it already turned out. Glory to Ukraine!"

The state is doing everything to help Mariupol - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-03-11T00:09:00Z,"Ukrainians! One of the main tasks for us today was the organization of humanitarian corridors. Sumy, Trostyanets, Krasnopillya, Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel, Izyum. Almost 40,000 people have already been evacuated this day. They were given safety at last. In Poltava, Kyiv, Cherkasy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro, Lviv. Humanitarian cargoes were also delivered. Hundreds of tons of food, medicine. We are doing everything to save our people in the cities that the enemy just wants to destroy. Taking into account the work of humanitarian corridors in the previous two days, we have already evacuated about one hundred thousand people. But… Mariupol and Volnovakha remain completely blocked. Although we did everything necessary to make the humanitarian corridor work, Russian troops did not cease fire. Despite this, I decided to send a convoy of trucks to Mariupol anyway. With food, water, medicine. I am grateful to the drivers - brave people who were ready to fulfill this mission. An extremely important mission. But the invaders started a tank attack exactly in the area where this corridor was supposed to be. Corridor of life. For the people of Mariupol. They did it consciously. They knew what they were disrupting. They have a clear order to hold Mariupol hostage, to torture it, to carry out constant bombardment. Today they destroyed the building of the main department of the State Emergency Service in the Donetsk region. Right next to this building was the place where Mariupol residents were to gather for evacuation. This is outright terror. Blatant terror. From experienced terrorists. The world needs to know that. It has to admit it. We are all dealing with a terrorist state. But no matter what, we will try! Constantly! We will continue to try to bring to Mariupol the aid that people so desperately need. Ukrainians need. The invaders are doing everything to deceive our people in the besieged cities. They block communication. Prevent the provision of Information. The state is doing everything to help our city. Everything to tell the people of Mariupol: we are fighting. And we will not give up this fight. Therefore, if you have the opportunity to talk to the people of Mariupol, to write to the people of Mariupol, spread the truth. Remind them that Ukraine is with them wholeheartedly and is doing everything to stop the torture of the city. Russian propagandists have substantially intensified their activity today. And they tried very hard. Probably in order to cover up the crimes of their army in Ukraine. Crimes against Mariupol. Against Donbas. Against Kharkiv. Against dozens of other cities. Cover them up with new accusations. New-old fakes. They accuse us... Again us! That we are allegedly developing biological weapons. Allegedly, we are preparing a chemical attack. This makes me really worried, because we've been repeatedly convinced: if you want to know Russia's plans, look at what Russia accuses others of. Look, spreading such accusations in the Russian media shows that it is THEY who are capable of this. The Russian military, the Russian special services. It shows that they want it. They have already done such things in other countries. Similar! They themselves announced, they themselves organized, they themselves complained. And they will do so again. Again and again. If they are not stopped. They tore apart Moldova with Transnistria. They tore apart Georgia with Abkhazia. They tore apart Ukraine with Donbas and Crimea. But they blame us! Those who have become victims. Those who are forced to defend themselves. Fight for the right to live. They themselves come to us in tanks and with missiles. They take something that doesn’t belong to them. Capture. They are even ashamed to show their officers! They hide their generals. They conceal from their own people that they are sending conscripts to this war only to make the invasion forces larger. But we are to blame! We are accused of attacks on allegedly peaceful Russia. And now what? What are these allegations of preparing chemical attacks? Have you decided to carry out ""de-chemicalization"" of Ukraine? Using ammonia? Using phosphorus? What else have you prepared for us? Where will you strike with chemical weapons? At the maternity hospital in Mariupol? At the church in Kharkiv? At the Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital? Or at laboratories, most of which have remained since Soviet times and are engaged in ordinary science. Ordinary! NOT military technology. We are adequate people. I am the President of an adequate country, an adequate nation. And the father of two children. And no chemical or any other weapons of mass destruction were developed on my land. The whole world knows that. YOU know that. And if YOU do something like that against US, you will get the most severe sanctions response. Ukrainians! Our defenders! I have signed several important decrees. About awarding the title of Hero of Ukraine to thirteen of our defenders: Lieutenant Colonel Litun Andriy Mykolayovych. Posthumously. He died covering our troops and heroically restraining the enemy's offensive. Captain Korpan Oleksandr Bohdanovych. Posthumously. He saved our soldiers and civilian houses when he took the falling aircraft away from them. Junior Lieutenant Blokha Yuriy Ihorovych. Posthumously. In the battles in the Mykolaiv region he heroically protected brothers-in-arms, saving their lives. Senior Sergeant Ivashko Andriy Oleksandrovych. Posthumously. During the rocket fire, he personally provided information about the enemy's actions at the cost of his own life. Junior Sergeant Volkov Yevhen Volodymyrovych. Posthumously. For courage and heroism during the evacuation of the wounded in the Donetsk region, for saving our military. Major General Nikoliuk Viktor Dmytrovych. He skillfully led the defense in the north-eastern direction and managed to prevent the capture of Chernihiv. Colonel Khoda Leonid Oleksiyovych. During the war, under his command, more than 50 enemy vehicles were destroyed. Lieutenant Colonel Ponomarenko Vyacheslav Anatoliyovych. Thanks to his actions, a significant number of enemy’s equipment and soldiers in the city of Hostomel were destroyed. Lieutenant Colonel Yakovenko Oleksandr Oleksiyovych. He withdrew his units from the enemy artillery fire, thanks to which he saved personnel and continued to successfully defend the Donetsk region. Major Bova Yevhen Petrovych. For the heroic defense of Mariupol and holding positions under constant enemy attacks. Captain Boyechko Vasyl Vasyliovych. For the extremely successful destruction of enemy equipment and manpower. Sergeant Moroz Oleh Romanovych. Thanks to his heroic deeds, the enemy's offensive in the Luhansk region was stopped. Sailor Samofalov Valeriy Mykhailovych. In one battle, for the first time in the history of this war, he shot down three enemy helicopters. I also signed a decree awarding orders for personal courage to 39 national guardsmen, 31 policemen (9 posthumously), 14 border guards (4 posthumously) and 23 employees of the State Emergency Service. Today the rank of Brigadier General is awarded to: Nechayev Oleh Oleksandrovych. For the successful defense of the Kyiv region. Lishchynsky Vladyslav Vatslavovych. For extremely successful actions against the enemy in the Kherson region. Hutsol Volodymyr Volodymyrych. For the successful destruction of enemy airborne troops in Vasylkiv. Demyanchyk Hryhoriy Petrovych. For the successful organization of personnel training for our military units. And finally. Discussions on Ukraine's future in the EU continue today and tomorrow in Europe. I believe that our people, our state, our army did everything for us to be welcome there. As equals. For us to be invited there. This is the final exam for Europe. Among the leaders of the states there are those who support us. And there are also those who support only themselves. But we see how the nations of all European countries treat us. And this is the main thing. Because I know for sure - if people decided on our membership in the EU, they would definitely choose the people of Ukraine. Today, when I see the support of the people of each country in the squares of European capitals, I know that the Ukrainian people are already in the European Union. And politicians... I'm sure they will adjust to that. Preferably faster. Glory to the nations of Europe! Glory to Ukraine! Glory to our military! Thank you!"
"For every Ukrainian city affected by the Russian invasion, a reconstruction program will be created - Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-03-10T14:16:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy commissioned the government to elaborate a special state program for the reconstruction of every Ukrainian city affected by the Russian invasion. “After the war, after our victory, we will rebuild everything that was destroyed. Very quickly and with a very high quality. A special state program for reconstruction will be created for each affected city. I have already instructed the government to start the elaboration,” the President noted. According to the President, after the implementation of this program, Chernihiv, Sumy, Okhtyrka, Zhytomyr, Izyum, Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities will not see a single trace of the Russian invasion. “The best architects, the best companies, the best projects. For every city! I want to say this on the example of Kharkiv. Our Kharkiv, which is now experiencing the worst suffering since World War II… Freedom Square will be such that everyone, all of us, all Europeans will be there! Poltava Way, Belgorod Highway, Myronosytska Street, Regional Children's Hospital, Kharkiv Oncology Center, Karazin University, Labor Palace, Korolenko Library… We will rebuild everything! I promise you personally,” the Head of State emphasized."
"Thanks to our defenders, Ukrainians have not become slaves and will never become - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-03-10T14:08:00Z,"Ukrainians! Information about the victims of yesterday's bombing of the maternity hospital and the children's hospital in Mariupol appeared last night. We lost three people, including a child, a girl. The number of wounded is 17. These are children, women, medical workers. You know, this topic was mentioned on Russian television. It was on their talk show. But not a word of truth was said. The Russians were lied to that there had been no patients in the hospital and no women or children in the maternity hospital. The Russians were lied to that ""nationalists"" had allegedly taken up positions there. They lie confidently, as always. War crimes are impossible without the propagandists who cover them up. I want to tell them one thing: you will bear responsibility just as all those who give orders to bomb civilians. We will find all the property of the propagandists and their associates. We will do our best to confiscate it wherever it is. You love a rich life. Love prosperous countries. You will not have this anymore. And this is just the beginning. You will definitely be prosecuted for complicity in war crimes. And then, it will definitely happen, you will be hated by Russian citizens. Everyone whom you have been deceiving constantly, daily, for many years in a row. When they feel the consequences of your lies in their wallets, in their shrinking possibilities. In the stolen future of Russian children. War is never isolated. It always beats both the victim and the aggressor. The aggressor just realizes it later. But it always realizes and always suffers. Today, we are once again providing humanitarian corridors for our cities. The buses have already departed, the trucks are already on their way - with food, water, medicine. Mariupol, Volnovakha, Izyum, Sumy and the region. Cities and towns of the Kyiv region - Bucha, Borodyanka, Irpin, Hostomel... My heart is broken by what the invaders did to our cities, to our state! And by what they want to do to our people who need urgent help. Russian troops have already created a humanitarian catastrophe in Ukraine. But for them it is part of the plan. They want to humiliate our people. Make them take bread and water from the hands of the invaders standing on their knees. So that Ukrainians can save their lives just by going to the occupied territories or to Russia. That's why they are blocking Mariupol, that's why they are blocking Volnovakha, blocking other cities. The invaders specially organize this torture to give their propaganda channels new material. Just for that. Monsters. Despite everything, updated information was received every hour yesterday about people whom we managed to evacuate to the free territory of Ukraine. In total, more than 60,000 of our citizens were rescued yesterday plus those who did not have time until night and continued the evacuation in the morning. I spoke today, in particular about that, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. About the torture of our cities, our people. I spoke with French President Macron. I felt in a conversation with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson that our anti-war coalition will soon become much stronger. Consequently, the pressure on Russia for peace will also be much stronger. For us, specifics in relations with world leaders, with European leaders are very important. We are really fighting for our independence! For freedom, for equality for all on the continent! That is why we want to see from partners the decisions based on reality, not on declarations or abstract considerations. These days, the EU leaders will convene to discuss Russia's war against Ukraine. To discuss our application for EU membership. We are waiting for a concrete signal. We look forward to strong support. Because it will be fair, real, human, European. We know exactly the position of every leader. We know exactly who stands with us and who thinks that the European Union is just accounting, profits, expenses and nothing more. We will work, we will persuade. Life will convince them. Ukrainians! Our defenders! We all have been defending our state for the 15th day. We endured. The Ukrainian army is repelling attacks in key directions. Thanks to our military, National Guards, border guards, police, territorial defense and everyone who joined the defense of the state, we have not become slaves, and will never become! Because this is our spirit, this is our destiny. Pride for our Armed Forces of Ukraine is boundless! After the war, after our victory, we will rebuild everything that was destroyed. Very quickly and with a very high quality. A special state program for reconstruction will be created for each affected city. I have already instructed the government to start the elaboration. Chernihiv and Sumy, Okhtyrka and Zhytomyr, Izyum, Mariupol and all our beautiful cities to which evil has come will not see a single trace of the Russian invasion. The best architects, the best companies, the best projects. For every city! I want to say this on the example of Kharkiv. Our Kharkiv, which is now experiencing the worst suffering since World War II. Saltivka, Oleksiivka... Perhaps most Ukrainians know nothing about these names. But the people of Kharkiv will hear. Freedom Square will be such that everyone, all of us, all Europeans will be there! Poltava Way, Belgorod Highway, Myronosytska Street, Regional Children's Hospital, Kharkiv Oncology Center, Karazin University, Labor Palace, Korolenko Library. We will rebuild everything! I promise you personally. Kharkiv residents will see that Ukraine stands with them. And it really does. Glory to Ukraine!"

Where necessary, mandatory demining will be held along the route, said Iryna Vereshchuk. In addition, she reminded that a special power line was damaged at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant captured by the Russian armed forces, as a result of which the power units remained without electricity. ""We demand immediate access for the repair crew to eliminate the damage and we ask the world community to focus its attention on this issue,"" said the Deputy Prime Minister. Also, as Iryna Vereshchuk noted, the Donetsk-Mariupol gas pipeline was damaged. As a result, more than a million people in the cities of Mariupol, Berdyansk and others were left without heating. ""We demand access for special vehicles and repair crews so that we can repair the gas pipeline and ensure heating,"" she urged. Iryna Vereshchuk added that she would inform about other details of the evacuation routes."
Europeans must tighten sanctions against Russia so that it has no chance to continue the genocide in Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-03-09T23:56:00Z,"Europeans! Ukrainians! Mariupol residents! Today is the day that defines everything. Defines who is on whose side. Russian bombs fell on a hospital and maternity hospital in Mariupol. Children's hospital. Maternity hospital that is functioning! Buildings are destroyed. As of now, there are 17 wounded. Disassembly of the debris is still ongoing. People began to hide from the air threat in time. From 500 kg aviation bombs dropped by the invaders on Ukrainian cities. Many times already. Children's hospital. Maternity hospital. What did they threaten the Russian Federation with? What kind of country is this - the Russian Federation, which is afraid of hospitals and maternity hospitals and destroys them? Were there little Banderivtsi? Or were pregnant women going to fire at Rostov? Did someone in the maternity hospital abuse Russian-speakers? What was that? Was it the denazification of the hospital? It is beyond atrocities already. Everything that the invaders are doing to Mariupol is beyond atrocities already. Europeans! Ukrainians! Mariupol residents! Today, we must be united in condemning this war crime of Russia, which reflects all the evil that the invaders brought to our land. All destroyed cities. What they did to Volnovakha, Kharkiv, Izyum, Okhtyrka, Chernihiv, Borodyanka, Hostomel, Zhytomyr and dozens of other Ukrainian cities, which never posed any threat to the Russian Federation. Destroyed hospitals. Destroyed schools, churches, houses. And all the people killed. All the children killed. The air bomb on the maternity hospital is the final proof. Proof that the genocide of Ukrainians is taking place. Europeans! You won't be able to say that you didn't see what happened to Ukrainians, what happened to Mariupol residents. You saw. You know. Therefore, you must increase sanctions against Russia so that it no longer has any opportunity to continue this genocide. You must put pressure on Russia to force it to sit down at the negotiating table and end this brutal war. Moscow knows very well that Mariupol is also the Donetsk region. We have heard so much from Russia about the inhabitants of the Donetsk region. So many accusations, so many demands... And now we see how Russia actually treats the residents of the Donetsk region. Treats ordinary people who live in the houses of Mariupol, work at the enterprises of the city of Mariupol, are treated in hospitals of Mariupol and give birth to children, imagine, people like you give birth to children in the maternity hospitals of Mariupol. We have not done and never would have done anything similar to this war crime to any of the cities of the Donetsk, Luhansk or any other region. To any of the cities on earth. Because we are people. And you? I spoke today with European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. We also worked and spoke with Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson. Thank you for your support, Boris. The partners are fully informed about what is happening in our Mariupol. And about the situation in all other regions of Ukraine, where hostilities continue. We are working to make Russia feel the consequences of its actions. We are doing everything to finally secure our sky. I am grateful to the vast majority of Ukrainians who support this position. Those who collect signatures, who convince their acquaintances in the West, write on social networks, organize rallies. Together we must return courage to some Western leaders. So that they finally do what they had to do on the first day of the invasion. Either close the Ukrainian sky from Russian missiles and bombs, or give us fighter jets so that we can do everything ourselves. A pause without a decision has become simply deadly. Today we managed to organize the work of three humanitarian corridors. From the city of Sumy, from the cities and towns of the Kyiv region and from Enerhodar. In total, about 35,000 people were rescued. We will continue tomorrow. We are preparing six corridors. We pray that people will be taken out of Mariupol, Izyum, Volnovakha, etc. Taken to safe cities of our free Ukraine. And I am sure that every Ukrainian whose help these people need will do everything possible to make them feel our care. Until they can return home. And finally. Every year on March 9, the winners of the Shevchenko Prize are announced. Our national award for the most significant contribution to the preservation and development of the Ukrainian spirit, our national culture. I believe that our traditions must be observed during martial law and the fierce battles for our freedom. We must not betray them so that we preserve all ours, Ukrainian, completely while we are heading to victory. While we are heading to peace. The decree was signed. Now I look forward to meeting the winners. But after the victory. After the victory of Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!"
"Andriy Yermak: We are collecting all the facts about Russia's crimes and human rights violations in Ukraine, which will then be used in international courts",2022-03-09T23:17:00Z,"A web platform https://humanrights.gov.ua/ has been created to effectively collect and process information on human rights violations by the Russian Federation during the war with Ukraine, Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak told. ""The collected facts will be used as evidence for the defense and representation of Ukraine in the European Court of Human Rights and the International Court of Justice. By his decree, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has already authorized those responsible to represent and defend Ukraine's interests in the UN International Court of Justice in the case against Russia on genocide charges. And there will be more such cases,"" he stressed. Deputy Head of the Office of the President Yuliya Sokolovska noted that the Office of the President, the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Representative Office of the President of Ukraine in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea managed to coordinate efforts, enlist the support of partners and promptly create an intergovernmental platform, which will help collect evidence of human rights violations in our country. ""The information received will make it possible to prosecute the Russian Federation and defend Ukraine's interests in international courts,"" she said. In order to record human rights violations and/or crimes committed, it is necessary to fill out a form, describe the fact of human rights violations by the aggressor, attach available evidence: photos, videos, documents, information about witnesses, victims. All information and witnesses who will provide it will be under reliable protection. The information will be processed by a qualified team of lawyers and prepared to protect the interests of our state. The evidence base will be used only in court cases of Ukraine against the Russian Federation in compliance with international standards of justice. According to Deputy Minister of Justice for European Integration Valeria Kolomiets, the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine has been waging an effective legal war against the Russian Federation for eight years within the European Court of Human Rights. ""In the first week of full-scale Russian hostilities in Ukraine, we persuaded the court to take precautionary measures against the Russian Federation, which now automatically apply to each individual application that people already provide to the Court against the Russian Federation. The launch of this portal will help us more effectively and quickly establish work to protect the rights of the people of Ukraine during the military aggression of the country-invader,"" said Valeria Kolomiets."
Ukrainians withstood and inspired the whole world with their determination - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-03-09T12:34:00Z,"Brave Ukrainians of the unconquered country! It is already the 14th day of our defense. The 14th day of our unity. Truly all-Ukrainian. The scale of the threat to the state is maximum. The invasion contingent has already brought into our territory almost everyone who was gathered to invade Ukraine. But the scale of our answer is maximum as well. And these are two different words ""maximum"".  They have only equipment. At the maximum. We have our people in addition to the equipment. Up to the mark. They only have orders. To attack, to kill, to abuse. And we have a real desire of millions of Ukrainians to win. Defend ourselves. Clear our state... And on the renewed land There will be no enemy, adversary, And there will be a son, and there will be a mother, And there will be people on the land. Today is Taras Shevchenko's birthday. This is our old dream. It is his dream to clean the land. And it is alive! And quite real. Ukrainians! Everything is in our hands! We withstood and inspired the whole world with our determination. There is no such place on earth where they are not aware of the heroism with which the Ukrainian people defend our beautiful land. Even where we are not supported, they know well what we have achieved. And they feel what else we will achieve if we save the country. If we maintain unity. National force. If we continue to respond wisely and boldly to the activity of the enemy who can destroy the walls of our homes, our schools, our churches, who can destroy Ukrainian enterprises, but will never reach our soul, our heart, our ability to live freely and fight boldly. Our military and territorial defense units managed to replenish the arsenal of our equipment due to the many trophies they took on the battlefield. Enemy tanks, armored vehicles, ammunition will now work for our defense. For our lives. For our country. What could be more humiliating for the invaders? We will beat the enemy with his own weapons. In addition to ours, which the Russian troops have already felt well, so that more and more enemy soldiers and commanders are asking themselves a simple question: why were they sent to this foreign land, to this war? And we have no answer. Except for one word - death. Russian soldiers! You still have a chance to survive. Almost two weeks of our resistance have shown you that we will not give up. Because this is our home. These are our families and children. We will fight until we regain our land and take revenge for all our killed people. For the killed children. You can still be saved if you just leave. Do not believe your commanders when they tell you that you still have a chance in Ukraine. Nothing is waiting for you here. Except for captivity, except for death. You take our lives and give yours. And we know - we have communications interception - that your commanders already understand everything. This war must be ended. We must return to peace. Leave our home, go back to yours. 14 days of a full-scale brutal war. Terror against our people. Destruction of cities, blockade of entire districts, constant bombing... 14 days of absence of a vital decision. Not our decision! We would make that decision in hours if we had to help our friends. From the first day of the Russian invasion, Ukraine has been repeating to its partners that if you do not close the sky, you will also be responsible for this catastrophe, a large-scale humanitarian catastrophe. Russia uses missiles, aircraft, helicopters against us, against civilians, against our cities, against our infrastructure. This is the world's humanitarian duty to respond. But... There is no decision. We are grateful to Poland for the alternative - for its readiness to provide Ukraine with combat aircraft. The problem is in logistics. In fact, it is a technical issue. It must be solved! Immediately. There is an official decision of Poland to transfer the planes to the relevant base - the American base. We also have confirmation - we have all heard - that the agreement between the American party and Poland has been reached. But at the same time we hear that Poland's proposal is allegedly unfounded. And that's what they say in Washington. We also read this. So when will the decision be made? Listen: we have a war! We do not have time for all these signals. This is not ping pong! This is about human lives! We ask once again: solve it faster. Do not shift the responsibility, send us planes. Yesterday we finally managed to organize a humanitarian corridor. From the city of Sumy to Poltava. 1,600 students and 3,500 residents were rescued. Evacuation of people from cities and towns of the Kyiv region continues. More than 18,000 people have already been rescued from Dymer, Vorzel and Irpin. Today we will do everything to continue the functioning of humanitarian corridors. Sumy - Poltava. Izyum - Lozova. Enerhodar - Zaporizhzhia. Mariupol - Zaporizhzhia. Vorzel, Bucha, Borodyanka, Hostomel to Kyiv. Our government officials are working on this, our servicemen have created all the conditions. If there is at least one shot, full responsibility lies with the invaders. And you have already seen the world's response. Powerful. Sanction packages. In the morning I spoke with Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau. We have full understanding. Full support. Our delegation returned from Belarus last night, from negotiations. I will listen to their report. We will prepare for the next rounds of talks. For the sake of Ukraine. For peace. And finally. Concerning our unity. This is our strength. This is what is needed at this time. We are receiving a lot of signals that someone in Ukraine has decided that he or she may not fight anymore together with everyone. And tries somehow separately, for something personal, for some personal benefit... We are receiving various signals that some politicians are looking for threads to Russia again. And some others are again working for a split, contrary to unity. I want to say one thing and only once: I see what you are doing. If I hear another signal, the answer will be quick. As befits wartime. Thank God, our people have already sorted everything and everyone out. Glory to Ukraine!"
Ukraine calls on Russia to observe ceasefire commitments where humanitarian corridors will work on March 9 - Iryna Vereshchuk,2022-03-09T11:50:00Z,"Deputy Prime Minister - Minister for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories of Ukraine Iryna Vereshchuk calls on the Russian Federation to adhere to its official commitments to ensure the evacuation of civilians through the humanitarian corridors agreed upon with the participation of the International Committee of the Red Cross. As Iryna Vereshchuk said at the briefing, at 5:30 am on March 9, Ukraine received a message from the Russian side regarding the approval of routes previously proposed by our state, as well as a message about sending a letter to the ICRC with such approval. ""The military has agreed to cease fire from 9:00 to 21:00 this day. So, today from 9 o'clock in the morning the ceasefire regime is introduced on the following routes: Enerhodar - Zaporizhzhia, from Sumy in the direction of Poltava, from Mariupol in the direction of Zaporizhzhia, from Volnovakha of the Donetsk region in the direction of Pokrovsk of the Donetsk region, from Izyum of the Kharkiv region in the direction of Lozova of the Kharkiv region, as well as from the cities of Vorzel, Bucha, Borodyanka, Irpin, Hostomel of the Kyiv region to Kyiv via Stoyanka, Bilohorodka,"" Iryna Vereshchuk said. Separately, she stopped at Vorzel, where there is an orphanage with about 55 children and 26 staff members. There will be a separate operation to evacuate this facility. The Deputy Prime Minister stressed that the Russian Federation has undertaken a formal public commitment to cease fire from 9 am on March 9. At the same time, Iryna Vereshchuk noted that there is already a negative experience when the undertaken commitments did not work. It was in the directions Mariupol - Zaporizhzhia and Volnovakha - Pokrovsk. ""I am addressed by the residents of Volnovakha who are asking for the promise of the Russian Federation to be fulfilled today, so that people can leave the places where they are now hiding from Grads and the devastating fire that is killing them. We urge the Russian Armed Forces to adhere to their commitments and cease fire from 9:00 to 21:00. As we agreed,"" Iryna Vereshchuk said."

"The world does not believe in the future of Russia, yet speaks about Ukraine, helps and is preparing to support our reconstruction after the war - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-03-08T23:36:00Z,"Ukrainians! Today we have important news. The United States has taken a step that will significantly weaken the invaders. It will make them pay for aggression and be responsible for the evil they have done. For all the evil. America bans imports of oil from Russia, petroleum products, gas, coal. Prohibits US citizens from any investment in Russia's fuel and energy sector. I am grateful personally to President of the United States Biden for this decision. For this leadership. For this most powerful signal to the whole world. It is very simple: every penny paid to Russia turns into bullets and projectiles that fly to other sovereign states. Either Russia will respect international law and will not wage wars, or it will not have the money to start wars. Another gas station will be found. But it's not just about the money. A ban on oil imports to the United States will weaken the terrorist state economically, politically and ideologically. Because it is about freedom, about the future. About where the world will go. The United Kingdom is also banning the import of oil and petroleum products from Russia. I am grateful to Prime Minister Boris Johnson for the principled position you expect from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in difficult times. Speaking today in the British Parliament, I mentioned other difficult times. Other, yet similar. 1940, when tyranny threatened what it considered a small island. And it was sure that the island would not withstand brutal blows, bombings and a blockade. And it turned out that the island could do more than that tyranny. Because it had wisdom. And endurance. And friends. And strength. And it believed in the future, the future of its own and the future of freedom in Europe. As we believe. As we fight. And as we will win. Look: the world does not believe in the future of Russia, does not talk about it. Not a word, not a prospect. They understand everything. They talk about us. They help us. They are preparing to support our reconstruction. After the war. Because everyone saw that for the people who defend themselves so heroically, this ""after the war"" will surely come. There will be a new Marshall Plan for Ukraine. The West will form this support package. The British Prime Minister said this today. A man of his word, a sincere friend of Ukraine. We are already expecting tough decisions from the European Union. Sanctions. Against Russia. For this war. For this aggression, which its authors will regret. They will. For sure. That is why it is so important that the Russian leadership realizes that the world will follow the example of the United States, Great Britain, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Japan and other free countries. So, the world cannot be fooled. Sanctions cannot be avoided. I am grateful to those Russians who support us, take to the streets and fight. They are fighting daily for us and for themselves. Because they are fighting for peace. The war must end. We need to sit down at the negotiating table - honest, substantive, in the interests of the people, not obsolete murderous ambitions. I spoke today with Mark Rutte, Prime Minister of the Netherlands. We have a new page in relations with the Netherlands. Thank you for your support. With Prime Minister of Israel Bennett. With Prime Minister of Luxembourg Bettel and President of France Macron. We have support. We have an understanding. You may have seen in the news today the story that the United Nations allegedly does not consider the Russian invasion a war. I know this outraged many, and not only in Ukraine. I am grateful to our team. We made everything clear and quickly received assurances: there will be no lies in the UN structures. There will be no playing along with the aggressor. The word ""war"" will be heard on this site. Because that is the truth. We will not allow anyone in the world to ignore the suffering and murder of our people, our children. Today, when I spoke to the British Parliament, the scariest number was 50. 50 Ukrainian children killed in 13 days of war. And in an hour it was 52. 52 children. I will never forgive that. And I know that you will never forgive the invaders. Like Kharkiv, Mariupol and all other cities. In the evening, they fired a missile at Korbutivka in the Zhytomyr region. Destroyed the dormitory. How could an ordinary dormitory threaten Russia? What geopolitical interests of the nuclear state were threatened by it? Eternal memory to all the people who were killed by these savages. Today we managed to organize a humanitarian corridor from the city of Sumy to Poltava. Hundreds of people were saved. The humanitarian cargo was delivered. But that's only one percent of what needs to be done, of what people, blocked Ukrainians expect. We are ready. Our cargo is ready. Our transport is ready. But ... savages - they are not ready. They fire at evacuation routes. They block the delivery of essential products and medicines to people. What do they want? They want Ukrainians to take it from the hands of the invaders. This is torture. Deliberate. Systematic. Organized by their state. Foreign to us. And ruthless for everyone, even for its citizens. Oleshky in the Kherson region. Berdyansk and Melitopol in the Zaporizhzhia region. All the cities where Ukrainians are resisting, where they are protesting against the invaders... Know: we stand with you. We are grateful. The cargo will still go. No matter how many bullets stop them. Humanitarian corridors will still work. And only time separates you from freedom. Short time. Believe it. I believe. And I really want that. Glory to Ukraine!"
An Open Letter to the Global Media by Olena Zelenska,2022-03-08T22:11:00Z,"Recently, an overwhelming number of media outlets from around the world have reached out with requests for interviews. This letter serves as my answer to these requests and is my testimony from Ukraine. What happened just over a week ago was impossible to believe. Our country was peaceful; our cities, towns, and villages were full of life. On February 24th, we all woke up to the announcement of a Russian invasion. Tanks crossed the Ukrainian border, planes entered our airspace, missile launchers surrounded our cities. Despite assurances from Kremlin-backed propaganda outlets, who call this a ""special operation"" - it is, in fact, the mass murder of Ukrainian civilians. Perhaps the most terrifying and devastating of this invasion are the child casualties. Eight-year-old Alice who died on the streets of Okhtyrka while her grandfather tried to protect her. Or Polina from Kyiv, who died in the shelling with her parents. 14-year-old Arseniy was hit in the head by wreckage, and could not be saved because an ambulance could not get to him on time because of intense fires. When Russia says that it is 'not waging war against civilians,' I call out the names of these murdered children first. Our women and children now live in bomb shelters and basements. You have most likely all seen these images from Kyiv and Kharkiv metro stations, where people lie on the floors with their children and pets – trapped beneath. These are just consequences of war for some, for Ukrainians it now a horrific reality. In some cities families cannot get out of the bomb shelters for several days in a row because of the indiscriminate and deliberate bombing and shelling of civilian infrastructure. The first newborn of the war, saw the concrete ceiling of the basement, their first breath was the acrid air of the underground, and they were greeted by a community trapped and terrorized. At this point, there are several dozen children who have never known peace in their lives. This war is being waged against the civilian population, and not just through shelling. Some people require intensive care and continuous treatment, which they cannot receive now. How easy is it to inject insulin in the basement? Or to get asthma medication under heavy fire? Not to mention the thousands of cancer patients whose essential access to chemotherapy and radiation treatment have now been indefinitely delayed. Local communities on social media are full of despair. Many people, including the elderly, severely ill and those with disabilities, have been debilitatingly cut off, ending up far from their families and without any support. War against these innocent people is a double crime. Our roads are flooded with refugees. Look into the eyes of these tired women and children who carry with them the pain and heartache of leaving loved ones and life as they knew it behind. The men bringing them to the borders shedding tears to break apart their families, but bravely returning to fight for our freedom. After all, despite all this horror, Ukrainians do not give up. The aggressor, Putin, thought that he would unleash blitzkrieg on Ukraine. But he underestimated our country, our people, and their patriotism. Ukrainians, regardless of political views, native language, beliefs, and nationalities, stand in unparalleled unity. While Kremlin propagandists bragged that Ukrainians would welcome them with flowers as saviors, they have been shunned with Molotov cocktails. I thank the citizens of the attacked cities, who have coordinated to help those in need. Those that keep working - in pharmacies, stores, public transportation, and social services – showing that in Ukraine, life wins. I acknowledge those that have provided humanitarian aid to our citizens and thank you for your continued support. And to our neighbors who have generously opened their borders to provide shelter for our women and children, thank you for keeping them safe, when the aggressor has rendered us unable to do so. To all the people around the world who are rallying to support Ukraine. We see you! We're here watching and appreciate your support. Ukraine wants peace. But Ukraine will defend its borders. Defend its identity. These it will never yield. In cities where shelling persists, where people find themselves under debris, unable to get out of basements for days, we need safe corridors for humanitarian aid and evacuation of civilians to safety. We need those in power to close our sky! Close the sky, and we will manage the war on the ground ourselves. I appeal to you, dear media: keep showing what is happening here and keep showing the truth. In the information war waged by the Russian Federation, every piece of evidence is crucial. And with this letter, I testify and tell the world: the war in Ukraine is not a war ""somewhere out there."" This is a war in Europe, close to the EU borders. Ukraine is stopping the force that may aggressively enter your cities tomorrow under the pretext of saving civilians. Last week to me and my people, this would have seemed like an exaggeration, but it is the reality we’re living in today. And we do not know how long it will last. If we don't stop Putin, who threatens to start a nuclear war, there will be no safe place in the world for any of us. We will win. Because of our unity. Unity towards love for Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!"
Address by the President of Ukraine to the Parliament of the United Kingdom,2022-03-08T20:36:00Z,"Mr. Speaker! Mr. Prime Minister! Members of the government, parliament, lords. Ladies and gentlemen! I'm addressing all the people of the United Kingdom. All the people of Great Britain. Great people. With a great history. I’m addressing you as a citizen, as President of a great country as well. With a great dream. And a great struggle. I want to tell you about our 13 days. 13 days of fierce war, which we did not start and did not want. But we are waging it. Because we do not want to lose what we have, what is ours - Ukraine. Just as you did not want to lose your island when the Nazis were preparing to start the battle for your great power, the battle for Britain. 13 days of our defense. On the first day at 4 am, cruise missiles were fired at us. So that everyone woke up - we, the children, all of us, living people, all of Ukraine. And we haven't slept since. We all took up arms becoming a large army. The next day we fought off attacks in the air, on land and at sea. And our heroic border guards on Zmiinyi Island in the Black Sea told everyone about the end of the war. Namely: where the enemy will go in the end. When a Russian ship demanded that our guys lay down their weapons, they answered him... As firmly as one cannot say in the parliament. And we felt the power. Great power of our people who will persecute the invader to the end. On the third day, Russian troops openly fired at people and apartment buildings without hiding. Used artillery, air bombs. And it finally showed us, showed the world who is who. Who are great people and who are just savages. On the fourth day, when we have already begun to take dozens of prisoners, we have not lost our dignity. We didn’t abuse them. We treat them like people. Because we remained human on the fourth day of this shameful war. On the fifth day, the terror against us has already become outright. Against cities, against small towns. Ruined districts. Bombs, bombs, bombs, again bombs on houses, on schools, on hospitals. This is genocide. Which did not break us. It mobilized each and every one of us. And it gave us a sense of great truth. On the sixth day, Russian missiles hit Babyn Yar. This is the place where the Nazis executed 100,000 people during World War II. 80 years later, Russia killed them for a second time. On the seventh day, we realized they were destroying even the churches. Using bombs! Rockets again. They do not know the holy and great as we know. On the eighth day, the world saw Russian tanks firing at a nuclear power plant. The largest in Europe. And the world began to understand that this is terror against all. This is a great terror. On the ninth day, we listened to a meeting of NATO countries. Without the desired result for us. Without courage. That's how we felt - I don't want to offend anyone - we felt that alliances don't work. They can't even close the sky. That is why security guarantees in Europe must be built from scratch. On the tenth day, unarmed Ukrainians protested everywhere in the occupied cities. Stopping armored vehicles with bare hands. We have become unbreakable. On the eleventh day, when residential areas were already bombed, when everything was destroyed by explosions, when children were evacuated from a damaged children's oncology hospital... We realized: Ukrainians became heroes. Hundreds of thousands of people. Entire cities. Children, adults - all. On the twelfth day, when the losses of the Russian army have already exceeded 10,000 killed, the general also appeared in this number. And this gave us confidence: for all crimes, for all shameful orders there will still be responsibility before the International Court or Ukrainian weapons. On the thirteenth day, a child died in Russian-occupied Mariupol. Died of dehydration. They do not allow food or water to people. They just blocked it - and people are in the basements. I think everyone hears: people don't have water there! In 13 days of the Russian invasion, 50 children were killed. 50 great martyrs. This is dreadful! This is emptiness. Instead of 50 universes that could live, they took them away. They just took them away. Great Britain! Ukraine did not strive for that. It did not seek greatness. But it became great during these days of this war. Ukraine that saves people despite the terror of the invaders. Defends freedom despite the blows of one of the world's largest armies. Defends despite the open sky. Still open to Russian missiles, aircraft, helicopters. ""To be or not to be?"" - You know this Shakespearean question well. 13 days ago, this question could still be raised about Ukraine. But not now. Obviously, to be. Obviously, to be free. And if not here, where should I remind you of the words that Great Britain has already heard. And which are relevant again. We shall not give up and shall not lose! We shall go the whole way. We shall fight in the seas, we shall fight in the air, we shall defend our land, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight in the woods, in the fields, on the beaches, in the cities and villages, in the streets, we shall fight in the hills ... And I want to add: we shall fight on the spoil tips, on the banks of the Kalmius and the Dnieper! And we shall not surrender! Of course, with your help, with the help of the civilization of great countries. With your support, for which we are grateful and on which we rely. And I am especially grateful to you, Boris, my friend! Increase sanctions against the terrorist state. Recognize it as a terrorist state finally. Find a way to make our Ukrainian sky safe. Do what you can. Do what you have to. Do what the greatness of your state and your people obliges to. Glory to the great Ukraine! Glory to Great Britain."
Ukraine must have a collective security agreement with all its neighbors with the participation of the world's leading powers - President,2022-03-08T13:20:00Z,"Ukraine is ready to hold a dialogue with Russia on security guarantees, on the future of the occupied territories of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Crimea, but is not ready to capitulate. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an interview for ABC News. ""I have spoken many times about NATO and publicly conveyed messages to both Russia and President Putin: we are ready for any guarantees of our country's security from the respective states that must guarantee. And Russia is also among these states, because Russia is our neighbor,"" he said. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in the future Ukraine must have a collective security agreement with all its neighbors and with the participation of the world's leading countries - the United States, France, Germany and Turkey, with which our country borders in the Black Sea. ""These will be guarantees not only for Ukraine. These will be guarantees for Russia as well, about which it is constantly talking. Although I don't know who it is protecting itself from. Because Ukraine has never attacked anyone, it only conducted defensive actions. Because it protects the last thing we have - the family and the land,"" the President stressed. As for the demands put forward by the Russian authorities, in particular regarding the recognition of the independence of the occupied territories of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the Head of State noted that a compromise is possible on this point. ""It is important to me how people who want to be part of Ukraine will live there. I am interested in the opinion of those who see themselves as citizens of the Russian Federation. However, we must discuss this issue. As well as compromises on Crimea. We cannot recognize that Crimea is the territory of Russia. I think it will be difficult for Russia to recognize that this is the territory of Ukraine. I think we are smart enough to ensure that the decision on these two issues does not cause any revolutions within societies, so that people are satisfied with this decision: both those who live in those territories and those who live in Ukraine,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy and added that before the occupation these territories were part of Ukraine. But in order to resolve all these issues, Russian President Vladimir Putin has to start a direct dialogue, the Ukrainian President said. ""The people who elected me are not ready to surrender, we are not ready for ultimatums. But we can discuss with Russia the future of Crimea and Donbas,"" the President added. As for the so-called denazification, which Russia points out among the demands on Ukraine, according to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, it is aimed at the destruction of the nation. ""It has happened many times in history and it has always ended very badly. It ended up for some states that they were later ashamed of starting the cleansing of the world of one nation or another. And some states were ashamed that on this terrible, bloody path, they had not defended another nation,"" he said. The President stressed that the proclamation of ""denazification"" is pure Nazism, it is the destruction of the Ukrainian nation. ""It was the same in the 1940s, Nazi Germany carried out denazification of the Jewish people. The same thing is happening now. I just didn't know it could happen in today's world. That a person who declares denazification can get some support for it. This is a crime against the nation. Because saying “denazification” and then bombing civilians is genocide against the Ukrainian people,"" he said, expressing confidence that in the future the world would recognize that it was the extermination of the Ukrainian people. When asked why he refused to leave Ukraine when he was offered it because of the threat to his life, Volodymyr Zelenskyy answered: “I refused. Because how can I? I am a citizen of this state, a legitimately elected President. If I left, I would end my life. I would be alive, but I would no longer be human. I would just be a body. I would not respect myself. And worst of all, what would I say to my children. Who am I? Did I behave as the President? As the guarantor of the Constitution? This is not just a phrase - the guarantor of the Constitution. I am the guarantor of my people. So we have to stand together. We have to defend ourselves together. That's why I'm here. I help my country, I support my state as much as I can. I support and I am proud of my military"". Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that and expressed hope for a ""happy end""."
"In the leading capitals, humanity must overcome fear and benefits, and then the Ukrainian sky will be safe, and the cities will be unblocked - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-03-08T12:23:00Z,"Ukrainians! We always celebrate this holiday. The holiday of spring. We congratulate Ukrainian women, our girls, wives, mothers. Always. But not today. Today, I just can't tell you the traditional words. I just can't congratulate you. I can't. When there are so many deaths. When there is so much grief. When there is so much suffering. When the war continues. A full-scale terrorist war against our people. The people of Ukraine. The invaders bombed Sumy again. With air bombs. Our peaceful city that has never threatened Russia in its history! Good, quiet, soulful Sumshchyna! Which is turned into hell. Mariupol. Peaceful and hard-working city without any internal malice. It was surrounded. Blocked. And is being deliberately exhausted. Deliberately tortured. The invaders deliberately cut off communication. Deliberately block the delivery of food, water supply. Turn off the electricity. In Mariupol, for the first time in dozens of years, perhaps for the first time since the Nazi invasion, a child died of dehydration. Hear me, today, dear partners! A child died of dehydration. In 2022! We have been fighting for the thirteenth day. We destroy the invaders wherever we can. Everywhere. But there is a sky. Hundreds of Russian cruise missiles. Hundreds of fighter jets of the invaders. Hundreds of helicopters. Yes, we destroy them. Russia has not lost as much aircraft in the past 30 years as in these 13 days in Ukraine. But they still have enough machinery to kill. There are still enough missiles for terror. They still have enough 500 kg bombs to drop them on us, ordinary people. On Chernihiv and Kyiv. Odesa and Kharkiv. Poltava and Zhytomyr. Dozens and dozens of Ukrainian cities. On millions of peaceful Ukrainian people. It has been 13 days of promises. 13 days when we are told that there will soon be help in the sky. There will be planes. They will be handed over to us... The blame for every death of every person in Ukraine from air strikes and in blocked cities, of course, lies with the Russian state, the Russian military, those who give and those who carry out criminal orders, who violate all the rules of warfare, who deliberately exterminate the Ukrainian people. The fault lies with the invaders. But the responsibility for this lies also with those who have not been able to make an obviously necessary decision somewhere in the West, somewhere in the offices for 13 days. Those who have not yet secured the Ukrainian sky from Russian murderers. Those who did not save our cities from air strikes. From these bombs, missiles. Although they can. Those who do not help in lifting the blockade. Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people in the cities are on the verge of life and death. Literally. Not as it sounds in the comments of politicians about providing Ukraine with vital combat aircraft. Vital missile defense. Vitally important! We have heard many assurances and seen many agreements. In particular, on the creation of humanitarian corridors. To save our citizens in Mariupol. But they didn't work. All of them didn’t work. Yet. And I have no more time to wait. We do not have. Mariupol doesn’t have time to wait. It is the invaders who want our people to die. Not us. We sent columns with humanitarian aid to Mariupol. Everything necessary is there! We sent vehicles to rescue people. Drivers understand everything. They are heroes. Brave people! They understand that Russian troops can simply destroy these vehicles on the road. Just as they did, killing people who were just trying to get to a safe territory from the war zone. But if you fire at these vehicles, these people, you should know that it will be before the eyes of the whole world. Everyone will be witnesses. And everyone will testify. When everyone, I repeat this, everyone who gives and fulfills inhuman orders will be severely judged and convicted. We have seen the concrete consent of the Russian side to organize an evacuation corridor from the city of Sumy. And not just for our people. For hundreds of foreigners. Citizens of India, China. These are students who studied in Sumy. You know, I was told that the Red Cross, the International Red Cross, forbids us to use the emblem on vehicles carrying out humanitarian missions. The Red Cross prohibits it as if it is their property. And this is indicative. This says a lot about the fact that some people, very influential, have decided to give up Ukrainians. But we will not allow it. And I will not allow it. Our friends. They are next to us. I will appeal directly to the nations of the world if the leaders of the world do not make every effort to stop this war, this genocide. Of course, we continue to talk to our partners, to the leaders, parliamentarians of all countries who know how to help Ukraine. We have a very busy negotiation period. I spoke with Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda. The people of Lithuania always stand by Ukrainians in this struggle. We feel this help and appreciate it. I spoke with President of the European Council, our friend Charles Michel. I also spoke with Prime Minister of India, Mr. Modi. But there are things that are not decided in negotiations, that depend not directly on us, but on humanity, which must win in the leading capitals, must overcome fear, must overcome any benefits. And then we will see that the Ukrainian sky is safe and the Ukrainian cities are unblocked. We can do this together as people of the world. And if the world stands aloof, it will lose itself. Forever. Because there are unconditional values. The same for everyone. First of all, this is life. The right to life for everyone. This is exactly what we are fighting for in Ukraine. Very fiercely, together with our military. This is exactly what these weak invaders want to deprive us of. This is exactly what the whole world must protect. Glory to Ukraine!"
"Ukraine's struggle for freedom depends not only on us, but also on other countries that share the values of freedom - Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-03-08T11:21:00Z,"Today Ukraine is fighting for its freedom and independence, but the success of our struggle depends not only on our state, but also on all countries of the civilized world. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an interview for ABC News. ""As for how much we can endure, a lot of things depend not only on us. We will endure. And even if they enter all the cities, there will be a guerrilla war. No one will give up our freedom and independence. Today it is here, tomorrow it will be the Baltic countries, the day after tomorrow - Poland, then - Germany,"" said the President of Ukraine. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, during a conversation with US President Joseph Biden, he discussed support for Ukraine in the sky. ""We want parity in the sky, at least so that there is a balance. We cannot give the advantage only to the Russian Federation, because it bombs us, shoots us, throws bombs, launches missiles, combat helicopters, fighters, planes - many things. We do not do that because we do not have the sky, we do not control it,"" said the President. He noted that Ukraine had asked the United States and other countries to provide Soviet-made military aircraft based in Poland. ""We have studied this issue, we know where these Soviet-made aircraft are located, in which countries. We asked them. And now a lot depends on the United States of America in this issue,"" the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that the US President could make additional efforts to resolve this issue. ""I am convinced that the President can do more. I'm sure he can. And I want to believe that he is able to do it,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He stressed that Ukraine today is a place of freedom in the heart of Europe, and our country needs protection of all countries that share such values. ""It seems to everyone that we are far from America, from Canada or somewhere else. No. We are freedom. And when someone crosses the borders of these rights and freedoms, we must be protected. Because at first it will be us, and then it will be you. It is always like this. Appetite comes with eating and it is getting stronger,"" the President said."
Iryna Vereshchuk: We urge the Russian side to adhere to the agreed and documented route of the humanitarian corridor from Sumy,2022-03-08T11:14:00Z,"Deputy Prime Minister - Minister for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories of Ukraine Iryna Vereshchuk informed that the functioning of the humanitarian corridor from Sumy affected by the shelling of the Russian troops had been agreed on as of today.  “This fact was officially approved by the Russian Ministry of Defense in a letter to the International Committee of the Red Cross. Hence, both the Red Cross and we, as the party with which the opening of the humanitarian corridor was agreed, have documental approval,” she said. Iryna Vereshchuk noted that one route for the humanitarian corridor for evacuation of people was established: Sumy, Holubivka, Lokhvytsia, Lubny, Poltava. No other routes were agreed. However, according to the Deputy Prime Minister, the Ukrainian party has information that the Russian side is planning manipulations with the route, not agreed upon and dangerous, to force people to go the other way. “We call on the Russian side not to resort to manipulative actions and to fulfill the promise, which is documented,” Iryna Vereshchuk emphasized. Under this route, the evacuation of civilians from the city of Sumy to the city of Poltava is planned, including foreign students - citizens of the Republic of India and the People's Republic of China. It is also a question of delivery of the corresponding humanitarian cargoes by the humanitarian corridor to the city of Sumy. In particular, food and essential medicines. The convoy of humanitarian goods will move to the city of Sumy along the route: Lokhvytsia, Andriyashivka, Romny, Nedryhailiv, Sumy. “The Ukrainian side is ready to fully ensure all the way along the agreed route. We informed both the Red Cross and the Russian side of our readiness. It was agreed to start the silence regime on the route at 9 am Kyiv time. We announce the beginning of the silence regime. The time frame of the humanitarian corridor is from 9 am to 9 pm,” Iryna Vereshchuk said. It was agreed that at 10 am the first column should start moving from the city of Sumy. Civilians will also follow the convoy in their own vehicles. Iryna Vereshchuk emphasized: all obstacles to the movement of the relevant convoys must be removed along the entire route - both for people leaving the city of Sumy and for humanitarian goods delivered to the city of Sumy. “A real ceasefire along the route of the humanitarian corridor will be the basis for informing the public about the possibility of evacuation,” she said. According to her, the Ukrainian party has also sent to the Russian side and the Red Cross the developed routes for humanitarian corridors: Volnovakha - Zaporizhzhia, Mariupol - Zaporizhzhia, Kyiv and Kyiv region in the direction of Western Ukraine, as well as Kharkiv and Kharkiv region in the direction of Western Ukraine. “We call on Russia to agree on these routes without delay, to inform the International Committee of the Red Cross and to ensure a stable ceasefire on these routes,” Iryna Vereshchuk noted. She also appealed to the citizens not to trust unofficial media sources and reports from the Russian Defense Ministry. “Trust the Ukrainian authorities. Listen, read the official media. Everything will be Ukraine!” the Deputy Prime Minister - Minister for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories of Ukraine stressed."
Every day of resistance creates better conditions for Ukraine in the negotiations to guarantee our future in peace - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-03-07T23:42:00Z,"Monday. Evening. You know, we used to say: Monday is a hard day. There is a war in the country. So every day is Monday. And now we are used to the fact that every day and every night are like that. Today is the 12th. 12th evening of our struggle. Our defense. We are all on the ground, we are all working. Everyone is where they should be. I am in Kyiv. My team is with me. The territorial defense is on the ground. The servicemen are in positions. Our heroes! Doctors, rescuers, transporters, diplomats, journalists... Everyone. We are all at war. We all contribute to our victory, which will definitely be achieved. By force of arms and our army. By force of words and our diplomacy. By force of spirit, which the first, the second and each of us have. Take a look at our country today. Chaplynka, Melitopol, Tokmak, Novotroitske and Kherson. Starobilsk. Everywhere people defended themselves, although they do not have weapons there. But these are our people, and that's why they have weapons. They have courage. Dignity. And hence the ability to go out and say: I'm here, it's mine, and I won't give it away. My city. My community. My Ukraine. Every Ukrainian man and woman who protested against the invaders yesterday, today and will protest tomorrow are heroes. We shout at the invaders together with you. We stand in the squares and streets with you. We are not afraid with you when the invaders open fire and try to drive everyone away. YOU do not back down. WE do not back down. And the one who repeated: ""We are one people"" - certainly did not expect such a powerful reaction. In the south of our country, such a national movement has unfolded, such a powerful manifestation of Ukrainianness that we have never seen in the streets and squares there. And for Russia it is like a nightmare. They forgot that we are not afraid of paddy wagons and batons. We are not afraid of tanks and machine guns. When the main thing is on our side, truth. As it is now. Mariupol and Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Sumy. Odesa and Kyiv. Mykolaiv. Zhytomyr and Korosten. Ovruch. And many other cities. We know that hatred that the enemy brought to our cities with shelling and bombing will not remain there. There will be no trace of it. Hatred is not about us. Therefore, there will be no trace of the enemy. We will rebuild everything. We will make our cities destroyed by the invader better than any city in Russia. Enerhodar. Chornobyl. And other places where barbarians just don't understand WHAT they want to capture. WHAT they want to control. Your work, your hard work on critical objects is a real feat. And we see it. We are sincerely grateful for it. The Ukrainian army holds positions. Well done! It inflicts extremely painful losses on the enemy. Defends. Counterattacks. If necessary - can take revenge. Necessarily. For every evil. For every rocket and bomb. For each destroyed civilian object. Today in Makariv, Kyiv region, they fired at the bread factory. For what? The old bread factory! Think about it - to fire at the bread factory. Who should you be to do that? Or to destroy another church - in the Zhytomyr region. The Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin built in 1862. These are NOT people. There was an agreement on humanitarian corridors. Did it work? Russian tanks worked instead. Russian ""Grads"". Russian mines. They even mined the road, which was agreed to transport food and medicine for people and children in Mariupol. They even destroy buses that have to take people out. But ... At the same time, they are opening a small corridor to the occupied territory. For several dozen people. Not so much to Russia, as to propagandists. Directly to their TV cameras. Like, that's the one who saves. Just cynicism. Just propaganda. Nothing more. No humanitarian sense. The third round of negotiations in Belarus took place today. I would like to say - the third and final. But we are realists. So we will talk. We will insist on negotiations until we find a way to tell our people: this is how we will come to peace. Exactly to peace. We must realize that every day of struggle, every day of resistance creates better conditions for us. Strong position to guarantee our future. In peace. After this war. Apart from the dead people and the destroyed cities, the war leaves destroyed the aspirations that once seemed very important, but now ... You don't even mention them. Almost three years ago, as soon as the election took place, we entered this building, this office, and immediately began planning our move. I dreamed of moving from Bankova. Together with the government and parliament. To unload the center of Kyiv and in general - to move to a modern, transparent office - as befits a progressive democratic European country. Now I will say one thing: I stay here. I stay in Kyiv. On Bankova Street. I'm not hiding. And I'm not afraid of anyone. As much as it takes to win this Patriotic War of ours. Today I signed a decree to present state awards of Ukraine to 96 Ukrainian heroes - our military. Including… The Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky of the second degree is awarded to: Major Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Sak. Commander of the mechanized battalion who entered the battle with the battalion tactical group of the enemy and won thanks to a rational approach to combat and non-standard tactics. Captain Rostyslav Oleksandrovych Sylivakin. Commander of the mechanized battalion, which successfully fought the overwhelming forces of the enemy, liberating Ukrainian towns and villages in the Sumy region. The Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky of the third degree is awarded to: Lieutenant Ihor Serhiyovych Lozovyi. Acting as part of the group, he stopped a column of enemy vehicles numbering about 150 units, which was moving in the direction of the Zhytomyr-Kyiv route. Destroyed. Lieutenant Vitaliy Viktorovych Poturemets. He showed exemplary courage and composure in the battle, destroying a column of enemy equipment near the city of Kyiv. He was wounded. The Order ""For Courage"" of the third degree is awarded to: Master Sergeant, Commander of the Automobile Platoon Valentyn Viktorovych Baryliuk. Thanks to his brave actions and personal determination, the tank unit received fuel in time and left the encirclement, destroying the enemy on the way. All 96 of our heroes are like these five! Our gratitude to all the military. Our gratitude to the Armed Forces of Ukraine! Our gratitude is boundless. Glory to Ukraine!"
Ukrainian and Russian delegations clarified details of functioning of humanitarian corridors - Mykhailo Podoliak,2022-03-07T20:53:00Z,"During the third round of talks in Belarus, the delegations of Ukraine and Russia clarified the details of the functioning of humanitarian corridors to provide more effective assistance to people in the cities most affected by the Russian shelling. This was stated by Adviser to the Head of the President's Office Mykhailo Podoliak after the meeting. ""We have received some positive results in terms of logistics of humanitarian corridors. They will be amended, and we will receive more effective assistance to people who are currently suffering from the aggression of the Russian Federation,"" he said. Intensive consultations will be continued on the basic, political bloc of settlement, in particular on the ceasefire and security guarantees.

President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy received the Ronald Reagan Freedom Award,2022-03-07T20:41:00Z,"Ambassador of Ukraine to the United States Oksana Markarova received the Ronald Reagan Freedom Award for President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which was presented by Chairman of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation Frederick Ryan. Frederick Ryan stressed that this high award honors the leadership of the President of Ukraine and the steadfastness of millions of Ukrainians who defend their right to choose their own future and inspire the entire civilized world to fight for the values of freedom and democracy to which Ronald Reagan dedicated his life. It was President Reagan who gave a decisive impetus to the destruction of the Soviet ""evil empire"" and paved the way for freedom and democracy for its enslaved nations in the former Soviet Union. Today, the Kremlin regime is trying to rebuild the wreckage of the Soviet empire having started a brutal and bloody war in central Europe. Just as more than three decades ago, the ""evil empire"" has no chance of existence. Ukrainians, with their blood and desperate struggle, fiercely repel the aggressor, showing courage and will. Frederick Ryan quoted famous words by President Reagan: “Above all, we must realize that no arsenal or no weapon in the arsenals of the world is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women. It is a weapon our adversaries in today's world do not have.”"
A bot was created to help children in difficult circumstances during the war,2022-03-07T16:06:00Z,"The Office of the President of Ukraine together with UNICEF and the Ministry of Social Policy have created a bot ""Child is not alone"" to help minors in difficult situations in wartime. War can separate parents and children, put families in crisis situations, but adults must do everything to help. If your child is lost, if you see a child who is alone, if you want to temporarily shelter a child in your family, if you know international organizations that are ready to shelter Ukrainian children, or if you have other issues concerning children, use the bot @dytyna_ne_sama_bot (“The child is not alone”). Due to hostilities, children may find themselves far from their parents or in crisis situations. Our common task is to help them."
The future of the continent is being decided by us with our resistance and by our friends with their help - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-03-07T12:01:00Z,"Peaceful people of a belligerent state! We have been defending ourselves against the invasion for 12 days already. We never wanted this war. But it was brought to us. We never dreamed of killing. But we have to knock out the enemy. From our land and from our lives. We have to endure what no other European nation has seen in 80 years. And it is on our land that it is decided whether someone else in Europe will fall victim to the same aggression. I'm telling this to the leaders of the world and I hear that they agree. We decide the future of the continent. WIth our resistance. And our friends - with their help. I spoke again with Polish President Andrzej Duda. They help us. Keep working. I spoke with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson and Prime Minister of Italy Mario Draghi. With President of France Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister of India Modi. I received very important signals, which, I'm sure, will only strengthen Ukraine. Our theses in conversations with partners are absolutely logical. They are fair. Honest. If the invasion continues and Russia does not abandon its plans against Ukraine, then a new sanctions package is needed. New sanctions, new sanction steps against war and for peace. Boycott of Russian exports. In particular, the refusal of oil and petroleum products from Russia. This can be called an embargo. Or just morality. When you refuse to give money to a terrorist. Boycott of imports to Russia. If they do not want to follow civilized rules, they should not receive goods and services from civilization. Let the war feed them. The international community must act even more decisively. When someone loses their mind, we have to lose fear and forget about commerce. We need to defend ourselves. You have to be moral. Both states and companies. We must fight against the inhuman force that wants to destroy humanity itself. The success of the Ukrainian army. The will of the Ukrainian people.The principled nature of international sanctions. This is the way to peace. At night the invaders fired at Mykolaiv. Right at the residential areas. Using rocket artillery. They fired at Kharkiv, at residential areas of a peaceful city. They fired at other cities of our state. No military sense. Just terror. Residents of Irpen, Bucha, Hostomel and many other towns and villages, which the invader managed to capture, are being held hostage. Temporarily. Until the invaders get punishment. And they will get it. Our Armed Forces know how to do it. The enemy is tired. Demoralized. They came to our land to look for something that has never been here: cowardice, consent to slavery. Any normal person is afraid to look at burned houses. It is obvious. Destroyed panel high-rise buildings. Destroyed ordinary cars. Missiles, air bombs, ""Grads"", mortars. Against people. It feels like it's in another country. But this is in our country. In ours, not somewhere else. In ours. Which has always wanted peace above anything else. How many more deaths and losses are needed to secure the sky over Ukraine? How do civilians in Kharkiv or Mykolaiv differ from Hamburg or Vienna? We are waiting for a decision. Securing the sky. Either with the power you have, or give us fighter jets and air defense systems that will provide us with the strength we need. This is the help that the world should provide not just to Ukraine, but to itself. To prove: humanity will win. As soon as possible. The Government of Ukraine is already working on how to restore our state after the victory. How to give more strength to the country while we are fighting. A special package of assistance to businesses and employees has been created. Sole proprietors of the first and second groups are completely exempt from UST. Enterprises and sole proprietors of the third group are exempt from paying UST for employees who were drafted into the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other defense formations. In particular, the territorial defense. Exemption from land tax and rent for state and communal land in all areas where hostilities are taking place. All this is during martial law and at least a year after its end. The payment of taxes for all enterprises that are unable to pay them is postponed. And this is only the first part of a large aid package. Government support. All leaders of the central government have a clear task: to develop a system of action so that the recovery of Ukraine is rapid and focused only on people. First of all - on people. For us all to return to peace, to normal work. When we return our land, return peace to our land. I am grateful to all business owners and managers who continue to work and fulfill their obligations to their employees. To pay salaries to people - even if the company does not work as before - is to protect Ukraine. The state fulfills all its obligations. Indexed pensions have already been provided to the people. The salary in the budget sphere is paid as it should be. Ukrainians! There are millions of us. And these are millions of ways to fight for our future. For our state. For our freedom. For our national flag. Blue and yellow. Not a tricolor. We defend our flag because it is our worldview. Under the blue and yellow we gained victories at the Olympics. We unfurled this flag both in space and in Antarctica. Under our national flag, our rescuers, firefighters, peacekeepers, medics and everyone else came to the aid of Turkey, Greece, Israel and Georgia, Afghanistan and Montenegro, India, Italy, the Congo and many other countries. What we have never done under this flag is attacking other countries, seizing foreign lands, killing people, peaceful people of other nations. We and terror are different universes. That is why there is no blood on our flag. There are no and will never be black spots on it. There are no and will never be any swastikas on it. The Ukrainian flag is the land. Peaceful, fertile, golden and without tanks. This is the sky. Peaceful, clear, blue and without missiles. So it was. And so it will be. I believe! I know. Glory to Ukraine!"
The audacity of the aggressor is a clear signal that sanctions against Russia are not enough - President's address,2022-03-06T23:09:00Z,"Ukrainians! Today is Forgiveness Sunday. A day when we always apologized. To each other. To all people. To God. But today, it seems, many have not mentioned this day at all. Have not mentioned the obligatory words: ""Forgive me."" And the obligatory answer: ""God forgives, and I forgive."" These words seem to have lost their meaning today. At least in part. After everything we went through. We will not forgive the destroyed houses. We will not forgive the missile that our air defense shot down over Okhmatdyt today. And more than five hundred other such missiles that hit our land. All over Ukraine. Hit our people and children. We will not forgive the shooting of unarmed people. Destruction of our infrastructure. We. Will. Not. Forgive. Hundreds and hundreds of victims. Thousands and thousands of sufferings. And God will not forgive. Not today. Not tomorrow. Never. And instead of Forgiveness, there will be a Day of Judgment. I'm sure of it. It seems everything Russian servicemen have already done is still not enough for them. Not enough ruined destinies. Mutilated lives. They want to kill even more. Tomorrow Russia has officially announced the shelling of our territory. Our enterprises. Defense complex. Most were built decades ago. By the Soviet government. Built in cities. And now they are in the middle of an ordinary urban environment. Thousands of people work there. Hundreds of thousands live nearby. This is murder. Deliberate murder. And I have not heard a reaction from any world leader today. From any Western politician. Reaction to this announcement. Think about the sense of impunity of the invaders: they announce their planned atrocities. Why? Because there is no reaction. Because there is silence. Not a word, as if Western leaders have dissolved tonight. For this day. I hope that at least tomorrow you will notice it. React. Say something. We know exactly who prepared this attack. We know exactly how orders will follow the vertical command. We know everything. And we will not forgive anything. The Tribunal is waiting for you. And God's judgment, if you try to hide. The audacity of the aggressor is a clear signal to the West that sanctions against Russia are not enough. Because they didn't understand. Did not feel. They did not see that the world is really determined. Really determined to stop this war. You will not hide from this reality. You will not hide from new murders in Ukraine. There was a lot of talk about humanitarian corridors. There were talks every day about the opportunity for people to leave the cities where Russia came. Russian military. I am grateful to every Ukrainian who stays to defend our cities, even in the encirclement. Our freedom. But I also know that there are people who really need to get out. Who cannot stay. And we heard the promise that there would be humanitarian corridors. But there are no humanitarian corridors. Instead of humanitarian corridors, they can only make bloody ones. A family was killed in Irpen today. A man, a woman and two children. Right on the road. As in the shooting club. When they were just trying to get out of town. To escape. The whole family. How many such families have died in Ukraine! We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will punish everyone who committed atrocities in this war. On our land. We will find every bastard. Which shot at our cities, our people. Which bombed our land. Which launched rockets. Which gave the order and pressed ""start"". There will be no quiet place on this earth for you. Except for the grave. Today I decided to award orders to the heads of regional administrations and mayors who have excelled in the defense of their communities. The Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky of the Third Degree is awarded to: Head of Kharkiv Regional State Administration Oleh Vasyliovych Syniehubov. Head of Mykolaiv Regional State Administration Vitalii Oleksandrovych Kim. Head of Donetsk Regional State Administration Pavlo Oleksandrovych Kyrylenko. Head of Luhansk Regional State Administration Serhiy Volodymyrovych Haidai. Head of Chernihiv Regional State Administration Vyacheslav Anatoliyovych Chaus. Head of Sumy Regional State Administration Dmytro Oleksiyovych Zhyvytskyi. The Order of Courage is awarded to: Mayor of Kharkiv Ihor Oleksandrovych Terekhov. Mayor of Mykolaiv Oleksandr Fedorovych Senkevych. Mayor of Chernihiv Vladyslav Anatoliyovych Atroshenko. Mayor of Sumy Oleksandr Mykolayovych Lysenko. Mayor of Kherson Ihor Viktorovych Kolykhayev. Mayor of Melitopol Ivan Serhiyovych Fedorov. Mayor of Nova Kakhovka Volodymyr Ivanovych Kovalenko. And I decided to award a special title to our heroes, our hero cities. As it has already been once. When we withstood another attack. But a similar attack. Another invasion. But no less brutal invasion. Hero cities will be: Kharkiv. Chernihiv. Mariupol. Kherson. Hostomel. Volnovakha. Glory to Ukraine!"
"Mankind should put forward demands to terrorists, not the other way around, because terror knows no boundaries - President of Ukraine in Global Citizen",2022-03-06T22:47:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed to the people through the Global Citizen platform to promote the decision to protect the Ukrainian sky from Russian attacks, civilians from bombing, and Ukrainian cities from destruction. ""The world must react firmly and, most importantly, quickly. The world must stop Russia's authorities. Stop Russia. It must stop rocket attacks and daily bombings,"" the Head of State stressed in his address. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that the whole world knows what terrorism, hostage-taking, and plane bombing are, but now the world community is facing a much larger manifestation of terrorism. ""Now you see something worse - not an individual terror anymore, not some marginal terrorist organization. You see a terrorist state. A state, which deliberately destroys the cities of Ukraine with cruise missiles, air bombs and artillery. A state that allows itself to fire from tanks at nuclear power plants. No other terrorist has done this before,"" the President said. The Head of State expressed his conviction: if Western politicians are afraid to make an important decision to close the sky over Ukraine for Russian aviation, they must provide us with means of protection in the sky. ""Give us, Ukrainians, planes that we can use to protect us, our children, our friends, our parents, our cities, our memory, our architecture. Give Ukraine air defense to ensure that no nuclear power plant is blown up and that Ukraine and the whole of Europe are not destroyed,"" he urged. In order for everyone to understand the importance of making such a decision, Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested imagining a situation in which hospitals, schools, other civilian institutions and residential neighborhoods anywhere in the world are subjected to such devastating attacks and bombing. ""What would you do if terrorists completely destroyed them with missiles, missile strikes, air bombs? As it happens in our country, in Ukraine. In our Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Mariupol, Odesa and other cities?” the President asked, noting that today it happens every day in Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on the public around the world to join the rallies in support of aid to Ukraine and the adoption of a decision that would save our country. ""We know that ordinary civilians around the world hear us, understand us much better than any politician. Politicians always lag behind people. So please speak up! Talk about Ukraine, take to the squares of your cities, support us, show your strong position, show your support for Ukraine!” he said. The Head of State also stressed that by helping Ukraine, the world also helps and protects itself, because terrorists and terrorism know no boundaries. ""You can't just tolerate terrorists killing. You can't make all the concessions. It is impossible. These are terrorists. We must help the victims of terror, we must help ourselves, because you know - terror knows no borders, there are no borders for terrorists. And terror is always looking for new victims,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy added. He called on citizens around the world to unite and be strong. ""Mankind should put forward demands to terrorists, not the other way around. Ukraine must have the right to its own protection, protection of its own life. With your help in our sky. Or with the planes that you have, but they are on the ground. And for us they will be the salvation. Salvation in the sky, so that life remains on our land. We must choose life right now,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy summed up. Global Citizen is a social action platform aimed at solving global problems, including overcoming world poverty through collective efforts."
"Volodymyr Zelenskyy after the shelling of Vinnytsia by the invaders: Close the sky over Ukraine, it is your humanitarian duty",2022-03-06T16:02:00Z,"After the rocket attack by Russian troops on Vinnytsia, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy once again called on Western countries to close the airspace over our country for Russian aircraft and missiles. “I've just heard the report on the missile strike at Vinnytsia. 8 missiles. Against our city, against our peaceful Vinnytsia, which has never posed a threat to Russia. In any way. A brutal, cynical missile strike has completely destroyed the airport,” the Head of State emphasized in his urgent address. The President stressed that the invaders continue to destroy Ukrainian infrastructure and residential buildings. “We repeat everyday: “Close the sky over Ukraine!”. Close it for all Russian missiles, Russian combat aircraft, for all these terrorists. Make a humanitarian air zone. Without rockets, without air bombs. We are people and it is your humanitarian duty to protect us, protect people. And you can do it,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged. “If you do not do that, if you at least do not give us aircraft for us to be able to protect ourselves, there can be only one conclusion: You also want us to be slowly killed. This is also the responsibility of the world's politicians, Western leaders,” the Head of State added."
President: Special funds are being formed for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war,2022-03-06T13:18:00Z,"Special funds are being formed in Ukraine, the task of which is to rebuild our country after the destruction caused by the Russian aggressor. This was announced by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his address. ""We have been fighting for 11 days. For freedom. For our state. We withstood. We already understand how we will rebuild our country. We are already forming special funds for the reconstruction of Ukraine,"" he said. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in particular, the Fund for the Restoration of Destroyed Property and Infrastructure, the Fund for Economic Recovery and Transformation, the Public Debt Service and Repayment Fund and the Small and Medium Business Support Fund are being established. ""And many other programs to support our people. Heroes who fight for our state. And this is just the beginning. And now we still need strength,"" the President stressed."
Ukraine receives support from partners backed by concrete steps - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-03-06T12:22:00Z,"I wish you victory, Ukrainian people! I will start with the words of support I hear from our partners. From our friends. Very important words of support backed by concrete steps. Every day and every night I talk to the leaders of many countries, to the leaders of the business community. During all the days of the war, there is almost no hour when Ukraine does not hear what help it will receive. I talked about it again with President Biden last night. I am grateful to him for his determination. For preparing more new solutions for Ukrainians and Europeans. More new sanctions against aggression! And before that I spoke with American congressmen. More than two hundred representatives of both parties of the Congress. They are very sincere. They are fully interested in really helping us, providing concrete assistance. These are conversations that increase our confidence. Because one who is on the side of light will never fall into darkness. The world has the power to close our sky from Russian missiles. From Russian combat aircraft, helicopters. If anyone still doubts, Ukraine needs planes. In fact, it's simple. When you have the will. To make the sky safe. The sky of Ukraine. The sky of Europe. I spoke with the Prime Minister of Australia. And I am grateful to Australians for their moral stance on Russian exports. There must be no port where a terrorist state can make money. The Prime Ministers of Albania, Bulgaria and Israel. Support for Ukraine. Inspirational conversation with Elon Musk. With a man who creates rockets for the future. Instead of killing with rockets for the sake of the past. We talked about how to win now. About how we will cooperate later. After the victory. Support for Ukraine from global business, from the leaders of the most advanced companies is no less important than support from leading countries. When the corporate world stands by you and is not afraid, you have double protection. Triple weaponry. You have a future. Ukrainians! We have already gained our future. But we are still fighting for our present. It is very important. We are fighting for where the border will be. Between life and slavery. And this is not only our choice. The citizens of Russia are making exactly the same choice right now. These days. During these hours. Between life and slavery. Today. Tomorrow. In the coming week. This is the time when it is still possible to defeat evil without irreparable losses. When for a position they threaten with dismissal or a paddy wagon, not with the Gulag. With material losses but not with execution. Don't miss this opportunity. Social networks, friends, acquaintances, colleagues and relatives. You must be heard! We, Ukrainians, want peace! Citizens of Russia! For you, this is a struggle not only for peace in Ukraine! This is a fight for your country. For the best it had. For the freedom that you have seen. For the wealth that you have felt. If you keep silent now, then only your poverty will speak for you later. And only repression will answer it. Do not be silent! The Russian servicemen who were taken captive by our defenders started speaking. Hundreds and hundreds of prisoners. Among them are the pilots of the planes that bombed our cities. Our peaceful people. We heard their testimony. We saw the documents. Maps. Plans. Elaborated NOT yesterday. This is NOT improvisation. This is war. They prepared this invasion exactly this way - cruelly, cynically. Сonsciously violating the rules of war. Therefore, Kharkiv. Therefore, Chernihiv. Therefore, Sumy. Therefore, Mariupol. And many, many other Ukrainian hero cities have faced pure evil. Atrocity. This was planned. But this will not kill our humanity. Despite everything, we treat war prisoners under the Geneva Convention. Despite everything, our missiles do not hit Russian civilian facilities in response. Or Belarusian. From where rockets fly to our territory every day. Columns of military equipment. Aviation. Against peaceful people. Against peaceful cities. Zhytomyr, Korosten, Ovruch, suburbs of Kyiv, cities in the south... They are preparing to bomb Odesa. Odesa! Russians have always come to Odesa. They have always felt only warmth in Odesa. Only sincerity. And now what? Bombs against Odesa? Artillery against Odesa? Missiles against Odesa? It will be a war crime. It will be a historical crime. Ukrainians! We have been fighting for 11 days. For freedom. For the state. We withstood. We already understand how we will rebuild our country. We are already forming special funds for reconstruction. There are already four of them. Fund for the Restoration of Destroyed Property and Infrastructure. Fund for Economic Recovery and Transformation. Public Debt Service and Repayment Fund. Small and Medium Business Support Fund. And many more programs to support our people. Heroes who fight for our state. And this is just the beginning. And now we still need strength. Wisdom. Will. Victory. Peace! Peace to save Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!"
"Ukrainians do not retreat, do not give up, do not stop the resistance - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-03-05T21:40:00Z,"Our free people! You are now at the height of your spirit. At the maximum of possibilities. Every soldier on the lines of defense. Every doctor who saves lives. Every firefighter who extinguishes fire. Every entrepreneur who continues to work. Dozens and dozens of other professions. Millions of people, which became one whole. Superpower of the spirit. Programmers who joined the information troops. Everyone who joined the territorial defense. Teachers and educators who do not leave children. Police officers. Civil servants. We all withstood the blow together. We will all rebuild our state together. What gives us this confidence? Where is it from? It's not just words. It's not just faith. This is our reality. Unconditional reality. Which is fueled by the energy of our people everyday. Our resistance. Our protest. Kherson. Melitopol. Berdyansk. Konotop. The reality of all cities and towns, rural communities that expel the invaders everyday. By their determination. By their unity. Freedom Square in Kherson is the whole of Ukraine. The streets of Konotop, where locals are shouting at the invaders, are Ukraine. Ukraine, which we know, love, protect and will not give up to any enemy. It is a special heroism to protest when your city is occupied. Even temporarily. When you don't have a weapon and in response you receive gunshots. And you don't run. When you don't have armor and an armored personnel carrier is coming at you. And you do not move aside. That is why the occupation is temporary! It is artificial. Our people, our Ukrainians do not retreat. Do not give up. Do not stop the resistance. They shout to the occupiers - go home. Like a Russian ship! They drive them away from our territory. They block the roads for them. Every meter of our Ukrainian land won by protest and humiliation of the invaders is a step forward, a step towards victory for our entire state. This is a chance to live. Ukrainians! In all our cities where the enemy entered. Feel it. Go on the offensive! You need to go outside! You have to fight! Every time when there is an opportunity. As in Kherson. As in Berdyansk. As in Melitopol. As in Konotop. You need to go out and drive this evil out of our cities. To prevent the creation of new DPR and LPR where normal life is simply impossible. Only slavery. Only on the knees. Donbas! Remember what they said about you: Nobody put Donbas on its knees! And no one will be able to do that! Everyone in Donetsk and Luhansk knows these words. They were often repeated. Earlier. What about today? Donbas, today is the time! We appeal to all people in the temporarily occupied territory. To all who hear us. Whose memory has not been erased by propaganda. Whose eyes have not been closed by fear. Whose soul has not been mutilated by cynicism. Fight for your rights! For your freedom. For Ukraine. Together with Kherson. Together with Berdyansk. Together with Kyiv and all other Ukrainian cities that value life and are not afraid of anything. I know that many of you believed that Ukraine allegedly hates you. Will allegedly attack you. Will allegedly destroy you. Liars on Russian TV talk about it every day. Liars. It's their job to lie to you every day. But this should not be your destiny. Just compare Donetsk after 8 years of war and Kharkiv after 8 days of war. You were told that we are destroying cities. Look at Kharkiv. At Chernihiv. At 500 kg bombs that were dropped on the houses of Ukrainians. They were killing us. They were killing children. Look at Borodyanka. Look at the destroyed schools. At the blown up kindergartens. At the damaged Kharkiv Assumption Cathedral. Look what Russia has done. It did it right in front of your eyes. Protect yourself! Otherwise, it will take your life, too. Your houses. Ukraine does not shoot its people. We do not blow up residential buildings. And everyone in Donbas has always been and will be our people. Our citizens. In Donetsk. Luhansk. Kherson. Berdyansk. Melitopol. Konotop. In all our cities. In all cities of our state. In Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!"
Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a zoom conference with US congressmen,2022-03-05T18:47:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke with representatives of both chambers and both parties of the US Congress in the format of an online conference. In total, more than 200 politicians joined the conversation with Volodymyr Zelenskyy to hear first-hand about the situation in Ukraine and ask questions. The President spoke about the situation in the country, the course of hostilities. In particular, he focused on war crimes committed by the Russian army: the shelling of schools, residential buildings, kindergartens, churches. The Head of State noted that the Babyn Yar memorial was damaged by rocket fire, as a result of which civilians died. Separately, Volodymyr Zelenskyy raised the issue of threats to the environment of Ukraine and Europe. According to him, the invaders pose a threat to chemical and nuclear facilities. They have already captured two nuclear power plants and are moving in the direction of the third - South Ukraine NPP. ""Cynicism is of such scale that they did not let firefighters into the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. We could not negotiate with uneducated people who are in the Middle Ages,"" the President said. He added that there are 15 nuclear units on the territory of Ukraine, each of which could potentially become the new Chornobyl. Volodymyr Zelenskyy told congressmen that Ukraine needs security in the sky to protect civilians and critical infrastructure. This can be ensured by closing the airspace over Ukraine or supplying our country with Soviet-made aircraft from the countries that still operate them. The President also called for further sanctions against Russia. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, additional effective sanctions would be an embargo on imports of all Russian products and deprivation of MFN status. During the conversation, the congressmen asked Volodymyr Zelenskyy their questions and promised to provide all possible assistance to Ukraine."
"I am sure that soon we will be able to tell our people: come back, because there is no more threat - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-03-05T11:22:00Z,"Free people of a free country! It is already the tenth day of our national struggle. Sincere faith. And round-the-clock work. The tenth day is like one infinitely long day. One infinitely long night that does not allow us to have a rest. Today is Saturday. Saturday. This word means nothing during the war. Like Monday or Thursday or any other day. They all became the same. We still protect the state. We still save people. The country does not know weekends anymore. It doesn't matter what time it is. It doesn't matter what date it is. And it will be so until victory. Late at night I spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron. And with President of Poland Andrzej Duda. Our interaction is constant. Our conversations are daily. I am immensely grateful to each of them. I am immensely grateful to Andrzej for his determination and devotion to our common cause. Protection of people. I am grateful to Andrzej's wife - Agata. They are friends whom I sincerely consider friends and sincerely wish to everyone. We managed to prevent a humanitarian crisis at the border. We managed to organize the situation so that thousands and thousands of Ukrainian women and children were treated decently. Nobody asks about their nationality, faith or how much money they have. In fact, we no longer have a border with Poland. Because we are together on the side of good. We do not have time for borders. I am sure that soon we will be able to tell our people: come back! Come back from Poland, Romania, Slovakia and all other countries. Come back, because there is no more threat. We are already thinking about the future. For all Ukrainians. After the war. About how to revive our cities. How to revive the economy. I spoke with World Bank President David Malpass, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva. We have an agreement among the largest financial institutions to support Ukraine. There is already a decision on emergency aid and tens of billions of dollars for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war. And these are only the first decisions. I emphasize these are only the first. I spoke with Turkish President Erdoğan. I spoke with the leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. I spoke with President of the European Council Charles Michel and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. The main topic is EU membership for Ukraine. I am grateful to Europeans - hundreds of thousands of people in different cities of our continent. Bratislava, Vilnius, Frankfurt, Lyon, Paris, Tbilisi, Prague. They came out yesterday in support of Ukraine. In support of Europe. They came out for peace to be reached as soon as possible. I am grateful to Americans for the unwavering bipartisan majority of ordinary people. We saw the poll. We saw the opinion of ordinary people in America who support ordinary people in Ukraine. Who demand tougher sanctions against Russia for aggression already now. Who support closing the sky now to save the lives of our people. 74 percent of Americans stand for the no-fly zone. 74! The vast majority. What else is needed to make a decision? We are sure that the result is similar in other democratic countries. The Armed Forces of Ukraine bravely hold all key areas of our defense. They are counterattacking the invaders near Kharkiv - defending the city. They are holding the line in Mykolaiv. Kyiv, Chernihiv region, Sumy region, Donbas. We inflict losses on the invaders they have not seen in their worst dreams. The Russian army has not reached the planned frontiers. Yet it has reached almost 10 thousand Russian soldiers killed. 10 thousand. This is dreadful! 18-year-old, 20-year-old boys. Very young, almost children. Soldiers who were not even explained why they were going to fight. For what and why they are in a foreign land.  10 thousand. Russia could definitely give these people something else. Instead of death. The Ukrainian people are resisting even where the invaders managed to pass. Unfortunately. But not for long. I admire every Ukrainian who is not silent. Who protests. Who takes the national flag and shows the Russian military that they will lose. They will definitely lose. Because it is impossible to win against people who stop military equipment without weapons in their hands. Who refuse to take anything from the hands of the invaders. Whose situation is tough and dangerous. But they do not lose their dignity. And will never lose it. At the talks in Belarus, the groups agreed on the first step. To bring back at least one percent of humanity from the normal level. Surrounded cities that are being destroyed and experiencing the worst days. Humanitarian corridors must work today. Mariupol and Volnovakha. To save people. Women, children, the elderly. To give food and medicine to those who remain. Our help is already on the way. Everyone who needs help should be able to leave. Those who are willing. Everyone who can defend their city must continue to fight. Must. Because if everyone leaves, then whose city will it be? We are doing everything - on our part - to make the agreement work. This is one of the main tasks for today. Let's see if we can go further. In the negotiation process. Let's pray for our military. Let’s help our civilians. Let’s work for peace. Glory to Ukraine!"
Website was launched for foreigners who want to help Ukraine protect its freedom and territorial integrity,2022-03-05T09:35:00Z,"The website fightforua.org was launched, containing all the necessary information for citizens of foreign countries who want to join the International Defense Legion of Ukraine. After Russia launched a large-scale military invasion of Ukraine on February 24 and began striking at civilians and infrastructure from day one, the Ukrainian state called on foreigners to join our struggle for peace and democracy in Europe and around the world. A decree of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on March 1, 2022 introduced a visa-free regime for entry into Ukraine for citizens of foreign countries who are willing to join the International Defense Legion of Ukraine, except for citizens of the aggressor state. Foreigners who want to help Ukraine can find detailed step-by-step instructions on how to join the fair fight against the aggressor at https://fightforua.org/. In particular, in order to join the International Defense Legion of Ukraine, it is necessary to apply to the Embassy of Ukraine in your country with the appropriate intention and specify what documents and clothing (equipment) are needed or recommended. Then you need to pass an interview at the Embassy with the Defense Attaché and register a visa with the consul. Then the application for conscription into the Armed Forces of Ukraine for voluntary military service under a contract is submitted. After that, the legionnaire will receive instructions on how to travel to Ukraine, the necessary documents and equipment. It is recommended, if available, to bring a military kit, such as clothing or its items, equipment, helmet, body armor, etc. If necessary, representatives of embassies and consulates of Ukraine will provide assistance along the way. Arriving at the assembly point in Ukraine, the legionnaire signs a contract and joins the International Defense Legion of Ukraine. After that, he is ready to join the battle against the invaders, along with fighters from around the world and Ukrainian soldiers."
"We continue to fight, we will protect our state and liberate our land thanks to our heroes - address by the President of Ukraine",2022-03-04T23:06:00Z,"Great people of a great country! A country of power. A country of freedom. The people of absolute moral leadership. We have endured nine days of darkness. Nine days of evil. This is three times more than darkness and evil expected. We responded to the invasion as we can in times of greatest danger. Responded with heroism. Solidarity. Mutual assistance. We responded in Ukrainian. So that the history of Europe will remember it forever. It will tell children about it. Show it to grandchildren. The whole continent will know the city of Kharkiv. The city of Chernihiv. The city of Sumy. The city of Volnovakha. The city of Mariupol. The city of Mykolaiv. And many other of our beautiful cities. Living cities! Cities that have withstood the worst invasion since World War II. I say this specifically as a fait accompli. Withstood. No matter what the situation is at the moment, strategically, everything is clear. Ukrainians are united from Uzhhorod to Kharkiv, from Kyiv to Kherson. Ukrainians are chasing the enemy near Kyiv. They are beating him for Okhtyrka. Punishing him for Hostomel. They will take revenge for Kherson. Our Kherson! Ukrainian Kherson. Which they tried to humiliate today. They failed. They were not allowed. Ukrainians have shown themselves. They did not allow themselves to be deceived in a cheap cynical show. With a handout instead of help. With propaganda instead of sincerity. Russian propagandists thought of our people as of themselves. And they saw that Kherson residents are proud. And respect themselves. Respect Ukraine. I understand how difficult the decision is. When in the occupation they come out against armed enemies. I feel how risky it is. But I see how our people refuse to play by the rules of the invaders. How our people remain Ukrainians. How our people stay with our state, even temporarily finding themselves in the darkness. If Russian politicians still have their eyes, they will be able to see what Ukraine is. What our freedom is. The invaders thought they could turn off our television to Ukrainians. Our connection. They thought they could take away products, shut off the electricity. They thought it would force Ukrainians to submit. But even if you deprive us of oxygen, we will breathe deeply, to say: get out of our land! Even in complete darkness we see the truth. And we will fight until it darkens in our eyes. Because we are the warriors of light. And today no one on Earth will be able to say that this line is pathos. The 9th day of the war. Many of us have a tradition to remember those who are not with us on the 9th day. Eternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine! Unfortunately, today there is a complete impression that it is time to give a funeral repast for something else: Security guarantees and promises. Determination of alliances. Values that seem to be dead for someone. The NATO summit took place today. Weak summit. Confused summit. Summit, which shows that not everyone considers the struggle for freedom to be Europe's number one goal. All NATO intelligence offices are well aware of the enemy's plans. They also confirmed that Russia wants to continue the offensive. As best it can. For 9 days we have seen a brutal war. They are destroying our cities. They are shelling our people, our children, and residential neighborhoods. Churches. Schools. They destroy everything that ensures a normal life. And they want to continue it. Knowing that new strikes and casualties are inevitable, NATO deliberately decided NOT to close the sky over Ukraine. We believe that NATO countries themselves have created a narrative that the closure of the sky over Ukraine would provoke Russia's direct aggression against NATO. This is self-hypnosis. Of those who are weak, underconfident. Internally. Although they may have weapons many times more powerful than ours. You had to think about people. About humanity itself. And what did you think about at that summit? All the people who will die starting from this day will also die because of you. Because of your weakness. Because of your disunity. All the Alliance has managed to do so far is to carry fifty tons of diesel fuel for Ukraine through its procurement system. Probably so that we can burn the Budapest Memorandum. To make it burn better. But it is already burnt for us. In the fire of Russian troops. Is this NATO we wanted? Is this the Alliance you were building? Today, the Alliance's leadership gave the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian cities by refusing to make a no-fly zone. You could close our sky. But… I do not know who you can protect and whether you can protect NATO countries. You will not be able to buy us off with liters of fuel for liters of our blood. Shed for our common Europe. For our common freedom. For our common future. But I am also grateful to our country's friends in NATO. There are many countries of our friends, our partners - most of the powerful partners. Those who help our state no matter what. From the first day of the invasion. And I'm sure, until the victory. And that's why we do NOT feel alone. We continue to fight. We will protect our state. We will liberate our land. Thanks to our heroes. I awarded decorations and medals to 76 Ukrainian heroes for personal courage and selfless actions for our defense. Unfortunately, 37 of them are awarded posthumously. I awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine to Lieutenant General Oleksandr Oleksiyovych Pavliuk, Commander of the Joint Forces Operation. I conferred the military rank of Brigadier General on Colonel Volodymyr Vasyliovych Shvorak, Deputy Commander of the East Operational Command of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. I conferred the military rank of Brigadier General of Justice on Colonel of Justice Serhiy Mykolayovych Melnyk, Head of the Military Law Institute of the Yaroslav the Wise National Law University. I conferred the military rank of Brigadier General on Colonel Artem Yevhenovych Bohomolov, Deputy Commander of the West Operational Command. I conferred the military rank of General on Valerii Fedorovych Zaluzhnyi, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!"
"Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed residents of European cities: Support Ukraine, and it will be a victory of freedom, a victory of light over darkness",2022-03-04T21:24:00Z,"During the teleconference, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed residents of European cities who took part in a rally in support of Ukraine. Rallies in support of our state and against the Russian invasion took place in Frankfurt, Prague, Lyon, Tbilisi, Vienna, Bratislava and Vilnius. In total, about 200,000 people took part in them. Speaking directly from the Office of the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that he dedicated the first minute of his speech to honoring the memory of all the perished Ukrainian servicemen, special service officers, police officers, reconnaissance officers, firefighters - ""those who gave their lives, who are now among us, but we don't see them anymore."" ""I want to dedicate a second minute to silence as well - in honor of our civilians: adults and children, dozens and hundreds of those who gave their lives but did not know about it. Gave lives and received eternal peace. I ask you to honor their memory in silence,"" the President said. The President dedicated the third minute to the people of Europe. ""Don't be silent. Come to the streets. Support Ukraine. Support our freedom. Because this is a victory not only over the Russian military, it is a victory of light over darkness. This is the victory of good over evil. The victory of freedom over what is happening today in our country, on the territory of Ukraine. Do not be silent, support Ukraine. Because if Ukraine does not survive, the whole of Europe will not survive. If Ukraine falls, the whole of Europe will fall. And if we win - and I am confident in our people, I am confident in you - it will be a great victory of democracy, values, victory of freedom,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ""Then moments of silence will turn into years of prosperity. Europe, be as strong as the people of Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!"" the Head of State emphasized."
"In order to implement the agreements reached at the talks on March 3, ways to resolve humanitarian issues are being elaborated - Adviser to the Head of the President's Office",2022-03-04T19:14:00Z,"In the framework of the agreements reached during the Ukrainian-Russian talks on March 3, ways are being elaborated to resolve humanitarian issues, including the evacuation of people and the delivery of food and medicine to the victims of the shelling of the cities. Mykhailo Podoliak, Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine spoke about this at a briefing in Lviv. According to him, a working group has been set up, which includes representatives of Ukraine and Russia, as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross as a mediator. They discuss how it is logistically possible to evacuate people from the affected settlements, as well as how to bring food and medicine there. ""I think that today, we will have a clear understanding, for example, as regards Mariupol, what will be the corridor there. Because about 200,000 people there want to be evacuated. In Volnovakha, about 20,000 people want to leave,"" Mykhailo Podoliak said. He stressed that the Ukrainian side has routing in all directions. This tripartite group is being finalized. For his part, leader of the Servant of the People faction Davyd Arakhamia expressed hope that the agreements reached during the March 3 talks on the evacuation of civilians and the creation of humanitarian corridors will be observed. According to him, the Russian side takes this negotiation process seriously and even speeds it up, as the current situation is very damaging to Russia's image in the eyes of the world."
The closed sky over Ukraine will change the course of the war with Russia and allow to resolve humanitarian issues - Mykhailo Podoliak,2022-03-04T18:54:00Z,"Closing the sky over Ukraine for Russian aircraft will significantly change the course of the war and help resolve a number of issues, including humanitarian ones. Mykhailo Podoliak, Adviser to the Head of the President's Office emphasized this during a briefing in Lviv. He noted that the Ukrainian state will continue its work to ensure that our international partners make this important decision. ""The concept of the closed sky will significantly change the disposition of this war and help us resolve humanitarian issues, i.e. (stop - ed.) the shelling of major cities in Ukraine, and in principle return the Russians to a more or less adequate status. So that they understand that they must fight against the army, if we are already at war, not against the civilian population,"" Mykhailo Podoliak said. That is why he called on the Ukrainian and foreign media to focus attention and emphasize the need to close the sky over Ukraine. ""If we do not want to have problems with the civilian population to the extent that we already have, we must all talk about the need for the closed sky. So that there are no cruise missiles and strike aircraft in the sky,"" the Adviser to the Head of Office of the President said. Mykhailo Podoliak noted that if this issue is resolved, everyone will see in one or two days how not only the negotiating position, but also the situation in Ukraine will change significantly. In particular, there will be no panic among the population, because bombs will not fall from the sky. This will also help the Ukrainian military, as Russia's ground operations are usually more predictable. ""Everything related to the closed sky - I want you to focus on this,"" said the Adviser to the Head of the President's Office."
Ukraine will not make any concessions that could undermine our struggle for territorial integrity - Mykhailo Podoliak,2022-03-04T17:36:00Z,"The position of Supreme Commander-in-Chief, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on negotiations with the Russian Federation remains tough: Ukraine will not make any concessions that could undermine our struggle for territorial integrity. This was stated by Adviser to the Head of the President's Office Mykhailo Podoliak during a briefing in Lviv. ""President Zelenskyy will definitely not make any concessions that could in one way or another undermine our struggle, which is being waged in Ukraine today for its territorial integrity and freedom,"" he said. ""Therefore, negotiations will be difficult. But they will continue,"" Mykhailo Podoliak added. According to the Adviser to the Head of the President's Office, the Head of State clearly understands all the nuances and circumstances of negotiations with the Russian Federation. ""We are not just present at the negotiations or just listening to them. We understand what they want to achieve, why they think so and what their real situation is,"" said Mykhailo Podoliak. He stressed that Ukraine's position in the negotiation process is significantly strengthened by our Western partners, as well as the success of the Armed Forces. According to the Adviser to the Head of the President's Office, when Russia planned a military operation in Ukraine, it expected that it would be very short, and the consequences in the form of sanctions would not be so significant. ""But today we have a long battle around many cities in Ukraine. We see that this is already a humanitarian catastrophe in the heart of Europe, and, of course, the package of sanctions that our Western partners impose on Russia today causes extremely significant consequences for them, which will last for a year or two or three, even if they are lifted today,"" said Mykhailo Podoliak. He noted that sanctions have already ruined the Russian economy, so the Russian side seeks to reach some solutions in the negotiations. ""It is clear that these decisions should be in the interests of Ukraine, because when they entered the negotiation process, it was one position... Today Ukraine is fighting as no one expected,"" said the Adviser to the President's Office. He also stressed that the Ukrainian side is ready to continue talks at any time, and suggested that the next round of talks with Russia will take place in a few days."
We have survived the night that could have stopped the history of Ukraine and Europe - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-03-04T11:21:00Z,"People of Ukraine! We have survived the night that could have stopped history. History of Ukraine. History of Europe. Russian troops attacked the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The largest in Europe. It alone could be like six Chornobyls. Russian tankers knew what they were firing at. Direct aiming at the station. This is terror of an unprecedented level. There are 15 nuclear units in Ukraine. And the Russian servicemen have completely forgotten about Chornobyl. About this world tragedy. Russian people, I want to address you. How is that even possible? Together in 1986 we struggled with the consequences of the Chornobyl disaster. You must remember the burning graphite scattered by the explosion. Victims. You must remember the glow above the destroyed power unit. You must remember the evacuation from Pripyat and the 30 km zone. How could you forget it? And if you have not forgotten, then you cannot be silent. You must tell your authorities, go to the streets and say that you want to live. To live on earth without radioactive contamination. Radiation does not know where the border of Russia is. All night I was in touch with partners, with the leaders of other countries, so that the world could react. I felt that the world leaders were shocked. Britain is convening a UN Security Council over the attack. The IAEA is launching its 24-Hour Incident and Emergency Center. Immediate sanctions against the nuclear terrorist state are needed. Immediate closure of the sky over Ukraine is needed, because only this can guarantee that Russia will not strike at least missiles and air bombs at nuclear facilities. I am grateful to our heroes from the National Guard who guarded the station and tried to stop the enemy. I am grateful to the rescuers who extinguished the fire. But a lot depends on the common people of Energodar. You understand the threat to the station better than anyone else. You live there. Next to it. And you see the invaders directly. Drive them away. Let them know that Energodar is Ukraine. That Ukraine is not a place for nuclear ashes. Ukrainians! The enemy has brought the vast majority of its troops into the territory of our state. Almost the entire Russian army is thrown against our people. But the heroic resistance of Ukrainians has been saving our country from this invasion for the ninth day. Ukrainian cities have not seen such inhuman cruelty since the Nazi occupation. Chernihiv, Okhtyrka, Kharkiv, Mariupol. They are purposefully destroying civilian infrastructure. Destroying people. Residential neighborhoods. Just yesterday, Russian bombs killed 47 people in Chernihiv. Peaceful people. Kharkiv... Kharkiv is simply being destroyed by rocket artillery and air strikes. Russia. Destroys. Kharkiv. How could this happen? This morning in Zhytomyr, the rocket hit the school building. Hit children. This is the reality when “fraternal” Russia comes. Yesterday, during talks in Belarus, we managed to agree on the creation of humanitarian corridors where people suffer the most. Today we will see whether the agreement works. Our defense inflicts maximum losses on the enemy. Almost 9,200 invaders were killed. As of the morning of the ninth day of the war. We beat them near Mykolaiv. We beat them near Kharkiv. We beat them near Kyiv. The capital remains a key target for the invaders. But they will not break us, they will not break our statehood. Never. No matter what they do, they will still lose. Because we are at home. We are on our own land. They are constantly preparing provocations. A provocation is being prepared in Kherson. They are going to put up a performance of a kind of rally for Russia. To do this, they brought strangers to the city. They are looking for local traitors. They want to make a TV picture as if Kherson is no longer Ukrainian. I want to remind you that this is how they started the so-called ""DPR"" and ""LPR"". You understand what happened to them later. This must be stopped. Kherson residents, show that this is your city. You can stop everything, any plan of the invaders. Do not listen to anyone - listen to your children, listen to your heart. You are Ukrainians. I urge Kherson residents to get rid of any despair. Ukraine will not give up what is ours. We are fighting against a powerful enemy that outnumbers us. Which outnumbers us in the amount of equipment. But which is thousands of light years away from normal people who have dignity. Show it. Our national flag. Our national anthem. Our national spirit. Be sure to let the occupiers know that they can only be in Kherson temporarily. And they will never be able to own Kherson. Like any other city in Ukraine. Let the occupiers know that they can only stay in Kherson temporarily. And they will never be able to own your city, Kherson. Like any other Ukrainian city - the city of our state. Glory to Ukraine!"
Ukraine requests the International Committee of the Red Cross to urgently assist in creating humanitarian corridors,2022-03-04T11:06:00Z,"During the second round of talks between Ukraine and Russia, the parties reached an agreement on joint provision of humanitarian corridors. The Ukrainian state requests the International Committee of the Red Cross to take urgent action to organize humanitarian corridors and is ready to do everything necessary to evacuate the civilian population and deliver humanitarian goods. Due to constant shelling by Russian troops, a number of Ukrainian towns and villages are on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe. Thousands of people are in urgent need of evacuation. These cities lack food, water, medicine, electricity and water. Settlements in the areas of hostilities that require the creation of humanitarian corridors are located in Sumy region (Sumy, Shostka, Romny, Konotop, Okhtyrka), Chernihiv region (eastern and northern parts), Kharkiv region (all of the region except the south-eastern parts), Kyiv (Bucha, Irpin, Vyshhorod, Ivankiv, Vasylkiv, Borodyanka), Mykolaiv region (Bashtansky, Snihuriv, Bereznehuvatsky directions), Zaporizhzhia region (Tokmatsky, Berdyansk, Velykobilozersky directions), Kherson (Chaplynka, Kalanchak, Henichesky and Novokakhovsky directions), Luhansk and Donetsk regions (Volnovakha district, Mariupol district), etc. ""Ukraine has sent all the necessary requests to international organizations to create humanitarian corridors for the delivery of essentials and evacuation of civilians. Unfortunately, there has not been any consent of the Russian side so far. Today's agreements on the results of the second round of talks between Ukraine and Russia give us cautious hope that we will finally be able to help our citizens,"" said Olha Stefanishyna, Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration of Ukraine, member of the Coordination Staff for Humanitarian Affairs and social issues. ""Elderly people, women and children do not receive medical care, babies are born in basements and the first thing they hear in their lives is the sound of explosions. Civilians lack food and drinking water, many of them are people with disabilities and chronic illnesses. Bringing them to dehydration, exhaustion, and suffering from a lack of timely medical care in the 21st century is nothing but torture. We very much hope that the President of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Mr Peter Maurer will do everything to deploy work in the humanitarian corridors to save lives as soon as possible,” says Tetiana Lomakina, coordinator of actions on Humanitarian corridors from the Office of the President. “During the 8 days of the war, 28 children were killed and 64 were wounded by the Russian occupiers. Maternity hospitals, kindergartens, schools were destroyed,” says the Adviser-Commissioner of the President of Ukraine for Children's Rights and Children's Rehabilitation Daria Herasymchuk. “Nearly one and a half million children are suffering from shelling in the affected areas and they are under siege now. Among them, there are orphans and children with disabilities who need immediate assistance”. The Ukrainian side is ready to ensure the transportation of people and the delivery of humanitarian goods. The Ukrainian Armed Forces guarantee safe passage of the corridor. Ukraine is expecting this from the Russian side."
"Invaders in captured Ukrainian cities create humanitarian crisis to send their ""humanitarian convoys"" - President",2022-03-03T23:22:00Z,"The invaders are creating a humanitarian crisis in the occupied cities of Ukraine, blocking Ukraine's ""green corridors"" and thus forcing people to leave to the territory of Russia. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a conversation with representatives of the Western media. ""Humanitarian cargoes for food, drinking water, medicines, insulin, there are especially many appeals from retirees - they are constantly sent on. Entrances for our humanitarian cargoes in the occupied towns have been blocked,” the Head of State said. According to the President, the invaders are deliberately blocking the ""green corridors"" so that their humanitarian goods can enter the city from the other side. They also do not allow Kharkiv residents to pass through ""green corridors"" to other regions of Ukraine, but instead create conditions and corridors for our citizens to leave to the territory of Russia, said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ""They say: 'Here's another green corridor'. Go to Russia. Come to Russia, we will give you food, water, no one will kill you there,"" he said. The President stressed that Ukraine will never ban or hinder the departure of citizens to Russia who decide to do so for rescue or other reasons. However, he stressed, Ukrainians do not want to go to Russia. ""I can't force people to go to Russia. I can't drive them with sticks. Many of them say: ""We will not go there,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated. The Head of State also noted that difficult living conditions are being created in the Russian-occupied settlements, which were unable to repel the attack in conditions when the invader significantly outnumbered them. ""Somewhere in some towns, they cut off electricity, take food from stores and then distribute stolen goods in the square to the people with the words: “There you go. We brought you the humanitarian convoy"". Cynicism,"" the President summed up."
"Volodymyr Zelenskyy: If the world does not help Ukraine stop Russia now, it will go ""to the Berlin Wall""",2022-03-03T22:55:00Z,"If the world does not help Ukraine stop the Russian Federation now, the aggressor will go to other countries in Eastern Europe, the Baltic states and beyond. President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy said this during a conversation with representatives of the Western media. ""If Ukraine does not stop all this and if the whole world does not unite around the determination of Ukraine, then there will be Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Moldova, Georgia, Poland, and so they will go to the Berlin Wall,"" he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked those countries that support Ukraine and transfer weapons, although the delay in this issue costs ""thousands of lives of Ukrainians"". The Head of State also noted that when he became President of Ukraine, he spoke from the very beginning about the need for security guarantees for our country. According to him, alliances of states such as NATO or the EU must defend their alliances, otherwise they will cease to exist. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that there should have been a decisive response to both the migration crisis caused by Belarus and the construction of Nord Stream 2, which has been an energy weapon and a means of pressure from Russia from the very beginning. ""I'm not saying we have to start a war, but the strength of an alliance is that it doesn't allow war. The world must show its strength without fighting,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. He added that the serious sanctions that have now finally been imposed on Russia have been the right measure. However, according to the President of Ukraine, if the world had imposed preventive sanctions against the Russian Federation before the invasion of Ukraine, Russia would not have taken such a step. Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that the most important step now would be to close the sky over Ukraine, and he spoke about this with US President Joseph Biden and other foreign leaders. ""The constant bombing of non-military infrastructure kills civilians. Tonight there was a bombing of Kyiv and other cities. You saw what was happening in Kharkiv in recent days, Mariupol was shelled. Moreover, missiles, Iskanders and bombers are flying from the territory of both Belarus and Russia,” he said. The President noted that if NATO countries cannot close the sky over Ukraine, they should at least provide it with military aircraft. ""We found all these planes, they have plenty. New planes. Are they very expensive, are they more expensive than human life? Well, we found planes from the Soviet era. Can we get them to repel the attacks? On our land, not on the territory of Russia, not on the territory of Belarus, but exclusively on Ukrainian land,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The President stated that ""the whole world was late with Ukraine"". ""And may them forgive me. Their people told them about it, not my people. You see what is happening in all squares of the world, how people come out and support. Because all these people are people,” the President summed up."
The participants of the talks reached an agreement on securing humanitarian corridors where the fiercest fighting continues - Mykhailo Podoliak,2022-03-03T22:31:00Z,"During the second round of talks, the representatives of Ukraine and the Russian Federation reached an agreement on joint provision of humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of civilians, as well as for the delivery of medicines and food to the areas of the fiercest fighting. This was announced by Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Mykhailo Podoliak following the talks. ""The parties reached an agreement on joint provision of humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of civilians, as well as for the delivery of medicines and food to the places of the fiercest fighting with the possibility of temporary ceasefire for the period of evacuation in the sectors where it takes place. Not everywhere, but only in those places where there are humanitarian corridors, there may be a ceasefire during the evacuation,"" Mykhailo Podoliak said. According to him, for this purpose, special channels of communication and interaction will be organized in the near future, and appropriate logistics procedures will be formed. At the same time, the Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine stressed that the Ukrainian delegation had not achieved the expected results during the talks. ""The humanitarian aspect was discussed in detail, because many cities are currently surrounded. There is a dramatic situation with food, medicine, with the possibility of evacuation. We have agreed to continue working in the third round as soon as possible,"" Mykhailo Podoliak said."
Volodymyr Zelenskyy: I would not like a story about Ukraine as about 300 Spartans - I wish peace to my country,2022-03-03T22:27:00Z,"Ukrainians do not take anything from anyone, but protect their land and their freedom. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an interview for foreign media. ""We have a special state and very special people. I really wouldn't wish their destruction. I wish they all stayed, and not just in the stories. I would not like a story about Ukraine as a legend about 300 Spartans. I want peace and I want it to come to my country,"" he said. At the same time, Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed: ""We are on our land, ready for anything."" He noted that the Russian army, which is fighting against the Ukrainian state, significantly outnumbers the Ukrainian army; the enemy does not count his people and does not take into account any losses. ""They brought a crematorium with them. That is, they are not going to show their families, their mothers, in advance that their children died here, that they came here to kill us. We are defending our freedom, our home, and that is why they are dying,"" the President said. He called such behavior of the Russian aggressor an act of genocide, which despite the tragic lessons of history is committed in the XXI century already. ""If we can't stop such steps, this is the end of the world. And the end of the world for such people,"" the Head of State is convinced. According to him, today Ukraine is a ""fence"" between civilization and non-civilization. The President noted that it is impossible to determine the time intervals in which Ukraine will be able to repel Russian aggression. ""We are not holding on in terms of time - we are holding on in terms of us, we are defending because it is our job. A job that has become the preservation of our lives, our history, our family,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Head of State noted that he, like anyone, worries about the lives of his loved ones, but shares the pain of every Ukrainian in these difficult times. ""We are afraid for our loved ones. And we are very afraid of losing the place we live in. I am afraid to imagine that I do not have a state, and you are asked: ""Where are you from?"", And you say: ""There is no such country."" I'm afraid of that. I am afraid of what we will leave to our future generations,"" he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also said that if he had not been President, he would have joined the Territorial Defense Forces to help Ukrainian defenders repel the military invasion. ""I would provide food, shoot, help, I would do what I was told. But if I had been told an ultimatum: you must lay down your arms, go to the other side, I would not have done so. No matter what warrior I am. That's the difference. Because we are here, we defend our own. We are not taking anything away,"" the Head of State stressed."

Essay by Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak for The New York Times,2022-03-03T13:33:00Z,"In launching a war on our country, President Vladimir Putin claimed Russia would “de-Nazify” and free Ukraine. But Ukraine — a nation that lost as many as eight million lives in World War II, a country that has a Jewish president — does not need to be freed from the liberated path it has chosen. Not since the end of World War II has Europe seen violence and naked territorial ambition at such a scale. I am writing this appeal from a bunker in the capital, with President Volodymyr Zelensky by my side. For a week, Russian bombs have fallen overhead. Despite the constant barrage of Russian fire, we stand firm and united in our resolve to defeat the invaders. We will fight to the last breath to protect our country. But make no mistake: Other autocrats are watching, taking lessons. They can create a coalition of bad will — just look at how once-peaceful Belarus is now serving as a staging ground for Russian troops. Listen to what Mr. Putin is saying. For years, the West listened to Mr. Putin but didn't hear him; it is just now waking up to the existential challenge he poses to the world order. Ukraine has never underestimated his intentions — not since Russian aggression against our country began in earnest in 2014 — nor his willingness to achieve domination by any means necessary. That’s because we know this war is not just about Ukraine. The Kremlin wants to create a new Russian empire. We Ukrainians have proved that we are able to effectively repel the invasion force alone. We have used the weapons the West has provided. We are thankful to our American and European friends, to democracies worldwide including Australia and Japan, for their quick decisions to help us, for their sanctions against the Russian economy, for the armaments and equipment to deter the aggressor. But it’s not enough. We need more — and, please, stop telling us military aid is on the way. Nothing less than our freedom — and yours — is at stake. In President Zelensky’s call with President Biden on Tuesday, he again appealed for more security, military and humanitarian assistance. Since 2014, the West’s critical security assistance helped to transform a Ukrainian military that is now capable of mounting a defense and inflicting large-scale casualties against the Russian invaders. Ukraine is not asking for its allies to put boots on the ground. But we need the West to back us up in order to keep defending our families and our land. We need to show Russia — in painful terms — the mistake it has made. The Russians underestimated our resolve and we’ve held them off for now. But as we speak, a 40-mile-long convoy of Russian troops and equipment is closing in on Kyiv. We need antitank and antiaircraft weapons and other ammunition delivered to our brave soldiers right now. We are calling on the West to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine. We recognize that this would be a serious escalation in the war and that it could bring NATO into direct conflict with Russia. But we firmly believe that Russia won’t stop at just Ukraine, which would potentially drag NATO into this conflict anyway. A no-fly zone would at least give Mr. Putin some pause. We also ask the West to increase the nonmilitary costs on Russia. We welcome the coordinated measures thus far, but we need more. Every Russian bank — not just a select few — must be cut off from the SWIFT banking system, and every Russian oligarch must be sanctioned. We are also calling for a full embargo on Russian oil and all Russian exports to the United States and Europe. These measures would not be without cost to the world economy, but the alternative is far worse. The international community should consider expelling Russia from the United Nations or, at the very least, excluding it from the Security Council, where it has a veto. Russia is waging war on Ukraine to destroy its democracy, its alignment with the West and the spirit of the Ukrainian people. Not content to strangle most political opposition and forms of civic expression within Russia, the ex-K.G.B. clique now running the country is using its position to further a revisionist ideology — one that hungers to reassert Moscow’s control over the former Soviet Union countries and to discredit the democratic world for its failure to stay united and respond. Again, make no mistake: Mr. Putin aims to advance this ideology by going for blood beyond Ukraine. He must be stopped. The shelling across Ukraine is not letting up; it’s gotten worse here in Kyiv, with women, children and other noncombatants taking refuge in bunkers and subway stations while Russia’s invading forces indiscriminately strike residential buildings and civilians. A high-rise apartment building has been hit, and at least one hospital has been damaged. They have fired rockets into the center of Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, and attacked the Chernobyl power plant. This is Moscow’s way of war. Mr. Putin’s forces will continue to terrorize the country to induce surrender. If they don’t succeed, they will burn it all down. It’s either bow or vanish; no third option is allowed. This is not going as planned for Russia, however. Everyday Ukrainians are confronting Russian soldiers, blocking tanks with their bodies. Russian forces are experiencing fierce resistance from both the Armed Forces of Ukraine and from Ukrainian citizens hurling homemade Molotov cocktails that Ukraine’s government is encouraging them to make. Ukrainians are defending their streets, their communities, their country and their identity. At the same time, Russian soldiers are surrendering en masse or sabotaging their own vehicles to avoid fighting, according to the Pentagon. They must know this war is unjust. We beseech our Western allies and partners to make the costs unbearable for Russia now. Article 4 of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances guaranteed that the United States, Britain and Russia would seek “immediate” action from the United Nations Security Council “to provide assistance” if Ukraine “should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used.” Just because the aggressor — Russia — vetoes U.N. Security Council action does not relieve the other parties of the promises they made to Ukraine. Even though Mr. Zelensky and I cannot be physically alongside every brave Ukrainian fighting for this country, our spirit is with them. Every day brings the possibility that our words may be our final ones. So let them be a plea for support for a free Ukraine. We have been able to withstand intense fighting in recent days despite the vicious brutality of the Russian aggressors, and we will continue to fight — even if Russia becomes an occupying force in Ukraine. We are united around the Ukrainian flag, the symbol of our identity, our resolve and our will, but our state’s future and survival largely depend on the West. This war could be a prologue to a greater European or even global massacre. As President Zelensky wrote on Twitter after a strike hit near Ukraine’s sacred memorial to Jews massacred in World War II, “what is the point of saying ‘never again’ for 80 years, if the world stays silent?” Standing with us today and helping us is the only way to achieve peace for all and ensure that history does not repeat itself — so that our future does not echo Europe’s darkest time."
"They wanted to destroy Ukraine so many times, but failed - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-03-03T11:20:00Z,"Unbreakable people of invincible Ukraine! Exactly two years ago, the first case of COVID-19 was recorded in Ukraine. The first weeks of fighting it were extremely difficult. But we were united, and therefore strong, and therefore we withstood. Exactly a week ago, Ukraine was attacked by another virus. Another disease. By those who suffer from severe annexation and occupation of foreign lands. One week ago, at 4 am, Russia invaded our independent Ukraine, our land. Acute fit of aggression, megalomania, delusion of persecution. Heavy psychological complexes and as a result - missile systems. Rocket artillery. Tanks and other armored vehicles - simply like locusts. The first hours and days of full-scale war were extremely difficult. But we were united, and therefore strong, and therefore we withstood. And it will be so. And we will continue to stand. We stand so that the invaders were forced to change tactics. Russia's missile and bomb strikes at Ukrainian cities are a confession that they could not do anything significant on land. All lines of our defense are preserved. The enemy has no success in any of the strategic directions. They are demoralized. They are doomed. Kyiv survived this night and withstood another missile and bomb strike. Our air defense worked. Kherson, Izyum, all other cities where the invaders carried out strikes from the air, did not give up anything. Chernihiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv hold the line. Odesa. They also want to destroy Odesa. But they will see only the bottom of the Black Sea. The target of Russia was the Assumption Cathedral in Kharkiv. One of the oldest Orthodox monuments of the city, monuments of Ukraine. During the war, the cathedral is a shelter for Kharkiv residents. Shelter for all people: believers and non-believers. For everyone, because everyone is equal. Holy place. Now it is damaged by war. They are not afraid of even that! They enjoy the fact that God does not give an instant rebuff. But he sees. And he answers. Answers so that you cannot hide. There is no such bunker to survive God's response. And we will restore the cathedral so that no trace of war remains there. And even if you destroy all our cathedrals and churches, you will not destroy our sincere faith in God, in Ukraine. Faith in people. We will restore every house, every street, every city. And we say to Russia: learn the words ""reparations"" and ""contributions"". You will repay everything you did against Ukraine. In full. And we will not forget those who perished, and God won't. You have come to destroy our cities. Destroy our people. Take away from us everything that is dear to us. You cut off electricity, water and heating to civilians in Ukraine. You leave people without food and medicine. You are shelling routes of possible evacuation. There is no weapon that you would not use against us, against the free citizens of Ukraine. And now you are telling your propagandists that you are going to send so-called humanitarian columns to Ukraine... Remember, godless men: when millions of people curse you, you have nothing to save yourself. Ukrainians in all war-torn regions will receive everything they need from us. Coordination headquarters are working in full. Real humanitarian goods are on the way. Our government has already prepared a program of special assistance for all Ukrainians who have lost the opportunity to work. Now. Because of the war. Where there is fighting! Every employee, every sole proprietor, every citizen of ours, from whom Russia has taken away the opportunity to work, will receive six and a half thousand hryvnias without any conditions. I especially emphasize this for older Ukrainians. Despite the war, we ensure full payment of pensions. Indexed pensions. As it should be in accordance with the law. From March 1, pensions for Ukrainians are indexed by 14%. The money has already gone to the banks. All payments will be made in full. Ukraine receives weapons from its partners on a daily basis. From real friends. More and more powerful weapons every day. Ukraine is already meeting foreign volunteers who are going to our country. The first of sixteen thousand. They are going to defend freedom. Defend life. For us. For all. And it will be successful. I'm sure. We have survived in our history and on our land two world wars, three Holodomors, the Holocaust, Babyn Yar, the Great Terror, the Chornobyl explosion, the occupation of Crimea and the war in the east. We do not have a huge territory - from ocean to ocean, we do not have nuclear weapons, we do not fill the world market with oil and gas. But we have our people and our land. And for us - it's gold. That is what we are fighting for. We have nothing to lose but our own freedom and dignity. For us, this is the greatest treasure. They wanted to destroy us so many times. They failed. They wanted to wipe us off the face of the earth. They failed. They backstabbed us. And we are on our feet. They wanted us to be silent. But the whole world heard us. We've been through so much! And if someone thinks that, having overcome all this, Ukrainians - all of us - are scared, broken or will surrender, he knows nothing about Ukraine. And he has nothing to do in Ukraine. Go home. To your home. Protect Russian-speaking people. Not all over the world. In your country. There are almost 150 million of them. And here... Glory to Ukraine!"
"For us, this is a patriotic war, and we know how such wars end for the invaders - address by the President of Ukraine",2022-03-03T01:14:00Z,"Good health to you, dear Ukrainians! Strong and kind! But – kind NOT to enemies. We are a nation that broke the enemy's plans in a week. Plans that have been built for years. Treacherously. Deliberately. With hatred of our country, of our people - of any people who have heart and freedom. But we stopped them. We beat them. Our military, border guards, territorial defense. Even ordinary farmers capture the Russian military on a daily basis. And they all say one thing: they don't know why they're here. Despite the fact that their quantity is ten times bigger, the morale of the enemy is deteriorating. More and more invaders are fleeing back to Russia. From us. From you. From all who drive out the enemy with javelins, stugnas, guns, tanks, planes, helicopters. Everything that shoots. But Ukrainians are beating the enemy even without weapons. I sincerely admire the heroic civilians of Konotop, Bashtanka, Energodar, Melitopol. Other towns and villages. Who do not let the invaders in by blocking the roads. People come out in front of enemy vehicles. This is extremely dangerous. But this is brave. It is also salvation. I'm sure you saw a video from Melitopol where Ukrainians protested against Russians who entered our city. Temporarily. I am sure of this: if they entered somewhere, it is only temporarily. We'll drive them out. With shame. As those people, ordinary people who drive the invaders out of grocery stores when the Russian soldiers are trying to find food do. These are not warriors of the superpower. These are confused children who were used. Take them home. Ukrainians! Every invader should know: they will not get anything here. No one will be conquered. Even if they can accumulate more equipment and more people, it doesn't change anything for them. Wherever they enter. They will be destroyed everywhere. They will not have peace. They will have no food. They will not have a single quiet moment. The invaders will receive only a rebuff from Ukrainians. Fierce rebuff. Such a rebuff that they will forever remember that we will not give up what’s ours. That they will remember what the patriotic war is. Yes, for us it is a patriotic war. We remember how patriotic wars begin. And we know how they end. For the invaders. Our army is doing everything to break the enemy completely. Almost nine thousand Russians were killed! In one week! In the Mykolaiv direction invaders have to take away the ""two hundred"" and ""three hundred"" with tens of helicopters. 19 years, 20 years ... What did they see in life, apart from this invasion? But most of them remain everywhere. Ukraine does not want to be covered with military corpses. Go home. Your whole army. Tell your commanders that you want to live. Not to die. To live. The war must be stopped and peace restored as soon as possible. Today was, as usual, an active day of negotiations with the leaders of the member states of our anti-war coalition. I held talks with the heads of government of Norway and Israel. With the President of Kazakhstan. With the Emir of Qatar Tamim Bin Hamad al Thani. With President of the European Council Charles Michel. With Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau. With President of Poland Andrzej Duda. Brilliant result at the UN General Assembly. 141 countries supported the resolution, which calls on Russia to withdraw troops from Ukraine immediately. 141 states stand for us! And for Russia - only four states that voted against. Here is the list: North Korea, Eritrea, Syria and Belarus. This is the list. These are the friends. And there will be no others for the state that does not know how to live in peace. Today I held a meeting with the heads of regions and cities of Ukraine. The new head of the Odesa regional state administration is already working. Maksym Marchenko. Military. Professional. Our guys on the ground are working hard to organize ""green corridors"". To take out civilians. To bring medicine. Volnovakha, cities of the Kyiv, Sumy, Kharkiv regions, south of Ukraine. This is very difficult. Extremely difficult. We are opposed by terror. But terror loses. Thanks to our heroes. Today I signed a decree awarding the title of Hero of Ukraine to fifteen of our defenders: Senior Lieutenant Maksym Vitaliyovych Bilokon. Posthumously. He took part in repelling the enemy's attack during the defense of Chernihiv, destroyed the enemy's subversive group and two enemy tanks. Lieutenant Colonel Oleksandr Valeriyovych Kapichun.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a conference call with local authorities on the current security situation in the country,2022-03-02T21:37:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a conference call with mayors, heads of regional state administrations and heads of military administrations. The parties discussed the current security situation in the country, preparation of cities for defense and its course, construction of fortifications, checkpoints, provision of equipment and weapons, etc. Particular attention was paid to the staffing of the Territorial Defense Forces and their coordination with local authorities and law enforcement agencies. In the context of the humanitarian situation, the heads of local authorities informed the Head of State about the number of civilian casualties, damage to infrastructure, public and private property. The most problematic regions were identified, the supply of medicines, food and the organization of ""green corridors"" where necessary were discussed. Following the meeting, the President gave relevant instructions. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also received information on the necessary personnel decisions."
Address by the President: Ukrainians are a symbol of invincibility,2022-03-02T09:32:00Z,"Good health to you, united country! I did not accidentally say ""united"". The seventh day of this terrible war began. A war we feel the same way. During this time we have had more unity than for over thirty years before. At first we were equally scared, then we felt equally painful. And now we do not care. Except for victory. Except for the truth. Except for peace. Except for the tranquility we want to achieve. Except for the lives of our people, for whom we are worried. Except for Ukraine. During this time, we have truly become one. We forgave each other a lot. We started loving each other. We help each other. We are worried for each other. Yesterday morning on Freedom Square we were all Kharkiv residents. Then the enemy destroyed us all by striking at residential buildings in Borodyanka. We were all bombed in Kyiv last night. And we all died again in Babyn Yar - from a missile strike. Although the whole world promises constantly - never again. For any normal person who knows history, Babyn Yar is a special part of Kyiv. A special part of Europe. A place of prayer. A place of remembrance for the hundred thousand people killed by the Nazis. The place of old Kyiv cemeteries. Who should you be to make it a target for missiles? You are killing Holocaust victims for the second time. During the Soviet era, a TV center was built on the bones there. And also a sports complex. Outbuildings. They built a park there. To erase the true history of Babyn Yar. But why was it bombed? This is beyond humanity. Such a missile strike shows that for many people in Russia, our Kyiv is completely foreign. They know nothing about our capital. About our history. But they have an order to erase our history. Erase our country. Erase us all. On the first day of the war, Uman was brutally bombed, where hundreds of thousands of Jews come every year to pray. Then - Babyn Yar, where hundreds of thousands of Jews were executed. I am now addressing all the Jews of the world - don't you see what is happening? That is why it is very important that millions of Jews around the world do not remain silent right now. Nazism is born in silence. So shout about the killings of civilians. Shout about the killings of Ukrainians. Last night and tonight they continued to bomb our cities. Bombs. Missiles. Artillery. Machine guns. Targeting peaceful people. Again. Targeting residential areas. Again. Mariupol, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Zhytomyr and other cities and towns of Ukraine. This cannot be explained by any human reason. Any reason of God. What then, if Babyn Yar was attacked? What other military facilities threaten Russia? What other “NATO bases”? Saint Sophia Cathedral? Lavra? St. Andrew's Church? Whatever they dream of there - damn them! Because God is with us! During this time, we have united the European Union already on a new level. Higher than formal. Higher than interstate. At the level of ordinary people. Millions and millions of Europeans. From the Atlantic Ocean to the suburbs of Kharkiv, where fierce fighting continues. When the European Parliament stood and applauded us, our struggle, it was an assessment of our efforts. Our unity. Six days of war like thirty years. That is why the European Union answers ""yes"" to us. We have started a special accelerated accession procedure. Our diplomats and our friends unite the world for the sake of Ukraine and peace even more. Neutral Switzerland has supported EU sanctions against Russian oligarchs, officials, the state and companies. Once again: neutral Switzerland! So what do some other countries expect? Our anti-war coalition has already been joined by the countries that Moscow relied on a week ago. This is an extraordinary result. You can't stay neutral right now! And what is the result for Russia? The flag of this state will no longer be seen in sports tournaments. Modern world culture will now be closed to them. Russian goods are being removed from store shelves around the world. Russian banks are disconnected from the global system. Russian citizens are losing their savings, losing all prospects. Russian mothers are losing their children in a completely foreign country. Think of this number: almost six thousand Russians died. Russian military. In six days of war. This is without counting the losses of the enemy last night. Six thousand. To get what? Get Ukraine? It is impossible. This is not to be changed by missiles. Bombs. Tanks. Any blows. We are on our native land. And for the war against us there will be an International Tribunal for them. Ukrainians! Another night of Russia's full-scale war against us, against the people, has passed. Hard night. Someone spent that night in the subway - in a shelter. Someone spent it in the basement. Someone was luckier and slept at home. Others were sheltered by friends and relatives. We've hardly slept for seven nights. Or we sleep, but anxiously. My dears, the time will come when we will be able to sleep. But it will be after the war. After the victory. In a peaceful country, as we need. Which we have always appreciated. And which we have never destroyed. I ask all of you to take care of your loved ones. Take care of your brothers-in-arms. I admire you! The whole world admires you. From Hollywood stars to politicians. Today you, Ukrainians, are a symbol of invincibility. A symbol that people in any country can become the best people on earth at any moment. Glory to Ukraine!"
Volodymyr Zelenskyy: The world already understands that the President of the Russian Federation should be brought to the negotiating table as soon as there is willingness to talk to him,2022-03-01T21:03:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy states that he does not have high expectations from the current format of the Ukrainian-Russian ceasefire talks, because in addition to calls, concrete steps towards each other are needed. However, the civilized world must bring President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table before it is too late. This was stated by the President in an interview with CNN and Reuters. ""I do not expect great results, because faith in this format, starting with Minsk, is being lost. There is a desire of the people to end this war. And in this desire, in addition to the words ""I want"", ""we want"" or constant appeals that ""Ukraine does not fulfill Minsk”, we must still work every day. Sit down, look for dialogue,” he said. The Head of State said he had not seen any specifics from the first meeting of the Ukrainian and Russian delegations, which took place near the border between Ukraine and the Republic of Belarus. ""I do not yet feel the specifics from this composition and this first meeting. The only thing is that there is one percent that they will be able to meet again and talk about certain steps forward,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The President of Ukraine stressed that a complete ceasefire is needed to start the dialogue. ""But to take steps forward, someone needs to take steps towards each other,"" he added. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, if partners are not ready to see Ukraine in NATO due to Russia's reluctance, security guarantees for our country must be worked out together. ""We are ready to talk about security guarantees for Ukraine. It depends on our partners. This means that we have our territorial integrity, that our borders are protected, that we have special relations with all our neighbors, that we are completely safe. And the guarantors who give us security, guarantee it legally,"" the President emphasized. The Head of State stressed that Ukraine will fight against the invader as long as necessary. However, he expressed hope that the war would not last long. ""The world already understands that it is necessary to bring the President of the Russian Federation to the negotiating table, while there is still willingness to sit at the negotiating table with him. I think so,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. At the same time, according to the President, he cannot say how long it will take. ""It is no longer measured in money. It, unfortunately, is measured in people. There cannot be too many people,"" he added. The Head of State stressed that due to the war and Russia's invasion, Ukraine does not have time for long bureaucratic procedures and delays in resolving issues, because the war continues, people are dying every day and help is needed. ""There are specifics in this war. Specifics to survive and do something. That's why we all act fast. That's why the army does everything quickly. That is why we are defending our state quickly. And in the same way, if they want to help us, everyone must act quickly,"" the President of Ukraine summed up."
"Ukraine fights for values of freedom and democracy, therefore counts on support of civilized world - President",2022-03-01T20:40:00Z,"Today, Ukraine is fighting for the values of freedom and democracy, and other countries of the civilized world must support our state in this struggle. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an interview for CNN and Reuters. ""The war in Ukraine is a war in general for values: life, democracy, freedom. So this is a war all over the world,"" the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that such important things are difficult to understand for people who do not see war in their country. ""That's why the message must be presented in a way to reach across all these thousands of kilometers, so that from Ukraine this feeling reaches the people in the United States and they understand what it is like here, what we are fighting for, understand that they should not just support Ukraine for nothing,"" said the President. The Head of State noted that our country was preparing for the full-scale Russian aggression in advance, but did not discuss it in public, so that the enemy was not ready for Ukraine's reaction. ""To say that we are preparing, look - here we will act like this, here - like this, we have six options for defending our state... We were not ready for that,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The President stressed that Ukrainians are fiercely fighting the enemy and winning precisely because they are at home and protecting their relatives and their homes. ""We are doing this sincerely and we believe that we must protect everything for the future of our children, who must also be protected today. Because you see that no one chooses goals anymore. Unfortunately, children are dying, dozens of children are dying. That's why we have something to defend. We are defending our right to live,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed."
"With Ukraine, the European Union will definitely be stronger - President at the session of the European Parliament",2022-03-01T16:14:00Z,"Ukraine proved its European choice and paid a high price for it. Now is the time for Europe to show that it chooses Ukraine. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a debate in the course of the extraordinary plenary session of the European Parliament on Russian aggression against Ukraine. “I think that today we give for values, rights, for freedom, just for the desire to be equal, the same as you, as every person - we give our best people, the strongest,” the Head of State emphasized. The President is convinced that Ukrainians will definitely win. “There is a saying ""Ukrainian choice of Europe"" - what we aspired to and what we went to. I would very much like Europe's choice of Ukraine to sound today,"" he noted.  Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that this morning was tragic for Ukraine, as two cruise missiles hit Freedom Square in Kharkiv, located near the border with the Russian Federation. The inhabitants of this city have always been very warm to the Russians. Kharkiv has the largest number of universities in Ukraine and many bright, smart, active young people. ""Freedom Square is the largest square in Europe. Imagine: in the morning, two cruise missiles hit Freedom Square. Dozens of victims. This is what the price of freedom is. We are just fighting for our land and our freedom. And believe me, despite the fact that all the big cities of our state are now blocked, no one will invade our freedom and state. Every square from today, whatever it is called, will be called Freedom Square. In every city of our state. Nobody will break us. We are strong. We are Ukrainians,"" the President stressed. The Head of State also noted that as of yesterday, 16 children had died in Ukraine. ""Once again, President Putin will say that this is “an operation, we are firing at the military infrastructure."" Where are our children? What military plants do they work at? On which rockets are they? Maybe they ride in tanks? You killed 16 children,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. According to him, Ukrainians are a very motivated people who are fighting for their rights, freedom and life. ""And now we are fighting for survival. And this is our main motivation. But we are also fighting to be equal members of Europe. And I think today we are all showing that we are. With us, the EU will definitely be stronger. Without you, Ukraine will be alone,"" the President said. ""We have proved our strength. Prove that you are with us. Prove that you do not let us go. Prove that you are truly Europeans. And then life will overcome death, and light will overcome darkness,"" summed up Volodymyr Zelenskyy."
President appointed the Head of the Kyiv City Military Administration to improve the defense of the capital,2022-03-01T13:46:00Z,"In order to strengthen the defense of the capital of Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a decree appointing General Mykola Zhyrnov Head of the Kyiv City Military Administration. “Defense of the capital is above all. That's why I decided to appoint a professional military person as the Head of the Kyiv City Military Administration for the period of war. To guarantee the defense of the city. To block the enemy's approaches to our capital. To ensure that the people of Kyiv have everything they need. The Head of the Military Administration will be General Mykola Mykolayovych Zhyrnov,” the Head of State informed. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Mykola Zhyrnov served as the commander of the support forces, organized the engineering support of the combat operations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 2014-2015 at a high level. He is currently a state expert of the Military Security Service at the National Security and Defense Council. The President said that Vitali Klitschko remains the mayor of Kyiv. “He will have his own sphere of responsibility. And now it is a joint work of the mayor and the Head of the Military Administration. After the war, we will return everything to its place in the capital,” the Head of State assured. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also noted that Kharkiv and Kyiv are now the most important targets for Russia. Its terror is aimed at breaking us, breaking our resistance. “They are heading to our capital, as well as to Kharkiv. Therefore, the defense of the capital today is the key priority for the state,” he said. “If we protect Kyiv, we will protect the state. This is the heart of our country. And it must keep beating. And it will keep beating. So that life triumphs,” the President concluded."
"The missile at the central square of Kharkiv is terrorism, and Russia must be held accountable for this in international courts - Address by the President of Ukraine",2022-03-01T12:37:00Z,"Kharkiv. A cruise missile strike. At the largest square of Europe. Freedom Square. Dozens of victims. This is what the price of freedom is. This is what the morning of the people of Ukraine is. Ukrainian Kharkiv and Russian Belgorod have always been close cities. In many ways. Even the border between them was only conditional, only on maps, but not in the soul. Not in the soul. Now everything has changed. After the cruise missile that struck Kharkiv from Belgorod. The missile that hit Freedom Square. The face of our Kharkiv. This is terror against the city. There was no military target on the square. Just as in those residential areas of Kharkiv hit by rocket artillery. The rocket aimed at the central square is an outright, undisguised terror. No one will forgive. No one will forget. This attack on Kharkiv is a war crime. This is state terrorism of the Russian Federation. After that, Russia is a terrorist state. Obviously. And it must be official. We call on all countries of the world to respond immediately and effectively to this criminal tactic of the aggressor and to declare that Russia is committing state terrorism. We demand full responsibility for terrorists in international courts. Kharkiv and Kyiv are currently the most important targets for Russia. Terror is meant to break us. To break our resistance. They are heading to our capital, as well as to Kharkiv. Therefore, the defense of the capital today is the key priority for the state. All cities of Ukraine must do everything to stop the enemy. The military and civilian authorities of each city are responsible for this. But Kyiv is special. If we protect Kyiv, we will protect the state. This is the heart of our country. And it must keep beating. And it will keep beating. So that life triumphs. Dear Kyiv residents! Defense of the capital is above all. That's why I decided to appoint a professional military person as the Head of the Kyiv City Military Administration for the period of war. To guarantee the defense of the city. To block the enemy's approaches to our capital. To ensure that the people of Kyiv have everything they need.

And now it is a joint work of the mayor and the Head of the Military Administration. After the war, we will return everything to its place in the capital. Regarding our diplomats. Right now, our diplomats are implementing fair and absolutely necessary decisions in relation to those states that have betrayed their word and international law. We immediately recall the Ambassador from Kyrgyzstan for consultations. For justifying aggression against Ukraine. We immediately recall the Ambassador from Georgia. For the obstacles to volunteers who want to help us. For an immoral attitude towards sanctions. And now I want to speak about those whose feat is an example of the highest moral strength. These are our doctors. You save people around the clock. Always. And now your work is one of the key lines of our defense. You keep it brilliant. Thousands of lives have been saved in 5 days. I am also grateful to everyone who provides our people with everything they need for life in these extremely difficult conditions. Food, energy, medicine. And I thank the ordinary people of Ukraine, who stop tanks with their bare hands, expel the invaders from administrative buildings by force of spirit and make their stay in Ukraine shameful. To prove that they are all strangers here. This is what the people's war is. This is what the people of Ukraine is. Glory to Ukraine!"
Address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy,2022-02-28T23:48:00Z,"Russian forces today brutally shelled Kharkiv with rocket artillery. This is definitely a military crime. A peaceful city. Peaceful residential areas. No military object. Dozens of eyewitness records prove that this is not a separate false shot, it is a conscious destruction of people. Russians knew where they were shooting. For this crime there will definitely be a tribunal. International. This is a breach of all conventions. No one in the world will forgive you the murder of peaceful Ukrainian people. Here is Ukraine. Here is Europe. Here is 2022. Evil, armed with rockets, bombs and artillery, must be stopped immediately. Destroyed economically. We must show that humanity is able to protect themselves. I believe that it is necessary to consider the full closure of the sky for Russian missiles, airplanes, helicopters. In five days of invasion, already 56 missile strikes have been carried out against Ukraine. 113 cruise missiles were fired. This is their ""fraternal friendship"". And the world knows what to do. I spoke about this with partners today. The state committing military crimes against civilians cannot be a member of the UN Security Council. The entrance to all ports, channels, airports in the world must be closed for this state . Such a state must not receive hundreds of billions for energy exports. Buying Russian goods now is to pay money for murdering people. Peaceful, proud, strong Kharkiv. You have always been such. You will always be such. We will withstand this as well. We will defend Ukraine. We will help everyone affected by inhuman invasion. Chernihiv, Okhtyrka, Sumy, Hostomel, Vasylkiv, Kherson, Mariupol, Donetsk and all other cities and towns of our native country will see a peaceful and safe life. Sincere condolences to all who lost their relatives and loved ones in this war. Eternal memory to those who died. Eternal glory to everyone who defends our freedom! Before addressing you, I signed a decree on awarding the title of the Hero of Ukraine to twelve our defenders: Now about Kyiv, our beautiful capital, the basis of our state, our security. For an enemy, Kyiv is the key target. They want to break our national statehood. Therefore, the capital is constantly in danger. Three rocket-bombing strikes are carried out only today. TETs-6 is the target. They want to damage a power station and leave our city without light. We did not allow them to break the defense of the capital. And they send saboteurs to us. Constantly. Hundreds. All they are being neutralized. In addition to defense, we are thinking about the rear as well. Provide people with everything necessary. We formed a round-the-clock coordination headquarters that collects all requests from regional administrations regarding the lack of the most necessary stuff. Products, medicines, fuel, equipment. The headquarters directly finds suppliers that can quickly and qualitatively meet such needs. This is the restoration of supply chains, interrupted by the war. Today, at the initiative of the Russian side, the first round of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia took place. These negotiations took place against the background of bombing and shelling of our territory, our cities. Synchronization of shelling with a negotiation process could be seen. I believe that Russia is trying to put pressure on us in such a way. Don't waste time. We do not perceive such tactics. Fair negotiations are possible when one side does not hit the other side with rocket artillery precisely at the moment of negotiations. So far we do not have the result we would like to get. Russia has declared its position. We have outlined positions in response - to end the war. Some signals we received. When the delegation returns to Kyiv, we will analyze what we've heard and then determine how to move to the second round of negotiations. Another thing that is very important to say. We've been waiting 30 years for this. Today I signed an application for Ukraine's membership in the European Union. We have gained the right to be together with everyone in Europe. The application has already been delivered to Brussels, officially registered. The time has come. Glory to Ukraine!"

This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his address. “Europeans are aware that our soldiers are fighting for our country and, consequently, for the whole of Europe. For peace for all European countries, for the lives of children, for equality, for democracy. And this gives us the full right to do the following. We appeal to the European Union for Ukraine's immediate accession under a new special procedure,” the Head of State emphasized. The President is grateful to Ukraine's partners for standing with Ukrainians, but mentioned that Ukraine’s goal is to be with all Europeans and, most importantly, to be equal. “I am confident that is fair. I am confident we deserve it. I am confident that all this is possible,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy said."
Stand firm: Address by the President of Ukraine,2022-02-28T11:00:00Z,"Good morning, Ukrainian heroes! The fifth day of Russia's full-scale war against the people of Ukraine. We stand firm. During this time, we have experienced as much as other nations may not have in decades. We have been told for a long time that there is something wrong with Ukrainians in this or that issue. That Ukrainians have to do so-called ""homework"" for decades. Because of this, we often did not notice what we are really capable of. And now we have shown ourselves to the fullest. And it's inspiring. For everyone. In every conversation with our partners, I hear sincere respect. Ukrainians have shown the world who we are. And Russia has shown what it has become. Just think about it: during the Russian invasion - in just four days - sixteen Ukrainian children died as a result of the Russian shelling. Sixteen! 45 children were wounded. Every crime, every shelling that the invaders commit against us, unites us and our partners even more. Russia did not believe in such a solidary and powerful reaction. But Ukrainians have changed that story. The European Union has decided to supply us with weapons. We are grateful. Yesterday I spoke with Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, about further, even stronger steps. Europeans are aware that our soldiers are fighting for our country and, consequently, for the whole of Europe. For peace for all European countries, for the lives of children, for equality, for democracy. And this gives us the full right to do the following. We appeal to the European Union for Ukraine's immediate accession under a new special procedure. We are grateful to our partners for being with us. But our goal is to be with all Europeans and, most importantly, to be equal. I am confident that is fair. I am confident we deserve it. I am confident that all this is possible. Yesterday I spoke with the Presidents of Portugal, Lithuania, President of France Emmanuel Macron and President of Poland Andrzej Duda. I am especially grateful to Andrzej Duda for our fruitful work. I spoke with the Prime Ministers of Belgium, Spain and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson. Support of our anti-war coalition is unconditional and unprecedented. Europe has closed the sky to all Russian planes. Global business refuses any ties with Russian companies. Let's see how this week will end for the Russian currency - what will be the fall of the ruble. As long as this criminal invasion of Ukraine continues, the Russian state is suffering losses as if the war passed through their territory. Do you need all this? Russian mothers, Russian teachers, Russian entrepreneurs, ordinary people. For what? Four and a half thousand Russian soldiers have already been killed. Why did you all come here? Why do the columns of your armored vehicles go against us? From our Crimea. From Yalta, Yevpatoriya, Sudak, Simferopol... These are not the names of military camps for tankers. Once again: four and a half thousand Russian invaders killed. Throw away your equipment. And leave. Do not believe your commanders. Do not believe your propagandists. Just save your lives. Leave. We dedicate every hour to strengthening our state. Anyone who can join the fight against the invaders must do so. Therefore, a decision was made - not easy from a moral point of view, but useful from the point of view of our protection. Under martial law, participants in hostilities - Ukrainians with real combat experience - will be released from custody and will be able to compensate for their guilt in the hottest spots of war. All sanctions are lifted from some people who took part in the anti-terrorist operation. The key now is defense. When I ran for presidency, I said that each of us is the President. Because we are all responsible for our state. For our beautiful Ukraine. And now it turns out that each of us is a warrior. The warrior in his or her own place. And I am confident that each of us will win. Glory to Ukraine!"

Address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the citizens,2022-02-27T18:10:00Z,"I had a phone conversation with Alexander Lukashenko. We haven't spoken to him in two years. And today I had a long substantive conversation with him. I explained to him in detail the impossibility of our clash. I do not want missiles, planes, helicopters to fly to Ukraine from Belarus. I do not want troops to go to Ukraine from Belarus. And he assured me of that. My task as President is to protect our state. And you have seen during these tough days how we are fulfilling this task. Alexander Lukashenko called on the meeting of the Ukrainian and Russian delegations on the Pripyat River. I emphasize: without any conditions. I will say frankly, as always: I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try. So that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as President, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance. And while our guys are there, the President is here, the Head of the Office is here, the Prime Minister is here, the army is here, the Commander-in-Chief is here. We will all defend our state and our borders. You and I must act pragmatically to achieve our goal. And our goal is our territorial integrity. You have seen our position one hundred percent. This is the unconditional protection of national statehood. As regards our motivation. It is obvious that our servicemen are fighting not for money, but for today, for tomorrow. And they provide a very tough response to what happened yesterday. But we must understand that today the most important job is to be a soldier, to defend the country. And that's why I really want the state to pay decently for this job. We will pay our armed servicemen a hundred thousand hryvnias a month. Not to hear ""thank you"" from them, but to let them know that the country is definitely grateful to them. And it will be so until this war is over. And the last thing. Yesterday, unfortunately, we lost our ""Mriya"". But the old ""Mriya"". And we are building a new one now. Glory to Ukraine!"

Address by the President of Ukraine to the citizens on the fourth day of the war,2022-02-27T10:21:00Z,"This night was hard. What do they do? This is revenge. The people rose to defend their state, and they showed their true faces. This is terror. They are going to bomb our Ukrainian cities even more. They are going to kill our children even more insidiously. This is an evil that has come to our land and must be destroyed. They lied that they would not touch the civilian population. But since the first hours of the invasion, Russian troops have been hitting civilian infrastructure. They consciously chose tactics to destroy people and everything that makes life just normal. Power plants, hospitals, kindergartens, residential buildings - all this is under attack every day. What the invaders are doing to Kharkiv, Okhtyrka, Kyiv, Odesa and other cities and towns deserves an international tribunal. We clearly record all their crimes. And there would have been many more of these crimes if it hadn't been for our courageous defenders. Ukrainian forces are great. Repulse attacks, breaking the enemy's plans. They do their job brilliantly. Yes, this is truly a job. A hard, fundamental, and most importantly - fair job. A job that deserves the highest appraisal and the highest gratitude. A decision was made to significantly increase the payments to our defenders. I can honestly say that it will be expensive. But there is nothing more precious than life and the struggle for our freedom and freedom of our next generations. And there are those who will help us. This is already real. We get weapons, medicine, food, diesel, money. A strong international coalition in support of Ukraine has been formed. An anti-war coalition. Here is the latest summary from the diplomatic frontline. There were very substantive talks with the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, the President of Georgia, the Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Johnson. Each conversation added specifics to the defense capabilities of our state and the strength of our military. Germany has announced the supply of 1,000 anti-tank grenade launchers and 500 Stingers with additional ammunition. Belgium provides 5,000 machine guns and 5 million rounds of ammunition, and another 4,000 tons of fuel. Thanks to active diplomacy, we've convinced all European countries to disconnect Russia from SWIFT. We thank President of Poland Andrzej Duda for his personal leadership in granting Ukraine membership in the European Union. Poland's daily assistance to our country is also very much needed. We have to call a spade a spade. Russia's criminal actions against Ukraine show signs of genocide. I talked about this with the UN Secretary General. Russia is on the path of evil. The world must deprive Russia of the right to vote in the UN Security Council. Ukrainians! We know exactly what we are defending. We will definitely win. Glory to each of our soldiers! Glory to Ukraine!"
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the citizens of Belarus,2022-02-27T09:54:00Z,"These words of mine will be addressed to the citizens of Belarus. Today, all of you are called to the polls to vote in the referendum. This could look like a normal political process. But now it certainly cannot be anything normal. Now decisions are made on a completely different level. Last night in Ukraine was cruel. More shelling. More bombing of residential areas, civilian infrastructure. Today there is not a single object in the country that the invaders would not consider a valid target for themselves. They fight against everyone. They fight against everything that's alive - against kindergartens, against residential buildings and even against ambulances. They use rocket artillery, missiles against entire urban areas in which there has never been any military infrastructure. Vasylkiv, Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and many other cities of Ukraine are surviving in conditions that were last seen on our land and your land during the Second World War. But in the war that is going on now, you are not on the same side with us. Regretfully. From your territory, the troops of the Russian Federation launch rockets into Ukraine. Our children are being killed from your territory, our houses are being destroyed, they are trying to blow up everything that has been built over decades - and, by the way, not only by us, but also by our fathers, our grandfathers. And all this is also a de facto referendum for you, Belarusians. You decide who you are. You decide who to be. How will you look into the eyes of your children, how will you look into the eyes of each other, your neighbors. And we are your neighbors. We, Ukrainians. Be Belarus, not Russia! You are making this choice right now. Exactly today. Now there is a lot of news about possible negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, which can end this war and restore peace to all of us. And they often mention your capital. Minsk. As a platform for these negotiations. A place we didn't choose. And, in fact, you did not, too.The leadership of Russia chose it. And now, there is an offer to meet there again. Four days ago, cruise missiles, planes, helicopters and equipment came from Belarusian territory. They hit our homes, they hit our lives. The heavy equipment followed. And this is a dreadful deja vu. You know, Kyiv was attacked at 4 am. Someone has such a sense of humor, just as in 1941. You slept, Belarusian brothers. And we woke up. But you are still sleeping. And we haven't gone to bed since that moment. Because we are fighting. We are fighting for our country. We are fighting for our freedom. Because we have every right to do so. If there were no aggressive actions from your territory, we could speak in Minsk. In your city. When you were neutral, we spoke in Minsk, we met many times. This is right. This is truthful. To talk like neighbors. Right now, you haven't made your big choice yet. And it is ahead, it should depend only on you. Not on Russia, not on Ukraine, not on America, but on the people of Belarus. That is why now we say - not Minsk. The venue for the meeting may be other cities. Of course, we want peace. We want to meet, we want the end of the war! Warsaw, Bratislava, Budapest, Istanbul, Baku - we proposed to the Russian side all of this. Any other city suits us in a country from whose territory missiles are not launched. Only in this way can negotiations be honest. And they can really end the war. I sincerely wish Belarus to once again become that kind, safe Belarus that everyone saw not so long ago. Make the right choice. I am sure this is the main choice of your great people."
Appeal to foreign citizens to help Ukraine in fighting against Russia’s aggression,2022-02-27T08:18:00Z,"Early in the morning of February 24, 2022, Russia launched a new military operation against Ukraine, an unjustified criminal and cynical intrusion. The Russian army is using very vile tactics with all elements of war crimes under Geneva 1949 Convention, killing civilians and destroying their homes with missiles and artillery. Ukrainians have manifested the courage to defend their homeland and save Europe and its values from a Russian onslaught. This is not just Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules and peaceful coexistence.  The President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy is addressing all citizens of the world, friends of Ukraine, peace and democracy. Anyone who wants to join the defense of Ukraine, Europe and the world can come and fight side by side with the Ukrainians against the Russian war criminals.

President posthumously awarded Vitaliy Skakun the title of Hero of Ukraine,2022-02-26T22:28:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed Decree № 74/2022 on awarding the title of Hero of Ukraine to sapper, sailor Vitaliy Skakun (posthumously) for outstanding personal courage and heroism shown in defending the state sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, loyalty to the military oath. ""I approved a decision to posthumously award the title of Hero of Ukraine to Vitaliy Volodymyrovych Skakun, a sapper of the 35th Separate Marine Brigade. At the cost of his own life, he blew up the bridge,"" the Head of State said. Vitaliy Skakun died on February 24, 2022 during the detonation of the Henichesk Bridge, which was carried out to stop the advance of a tank column of Russian troops."
Address by the President of Ukraine,2022-02-26T19:44:00Z,"Ukraine's readiness to defend its state, our solidarity with each other and courage have disrupted the scenario of occupation of our country. The world has seen - Ukrainians are strong, Ukrainians are powerful, Ukrainians are brave. So it is not surprising that such people always have friends more powerful than enemies. During the day, I spoke every hour with the leaders of states - friends of Ukraine. An extraordinary result was reached in relations with Italy. This is truly a new chapter for our states. The conversation with Prime Minister of the Italian Republic Mario Draghi put everything in its place. India is a traditional world power. Discussed with Prime Minister Modi the course of our repulse of the aggressor. Received full support. Thanked my and our friend Erdoğan for the unwavering support to our independence and territorial integrity. We agreed that today the ban on the passage of Russian warships in the Black Sea is extremely important. They did it. I told a good friend of Ukraine, Ilham Heydar oglu Aliyev, President of Azerbaijan, that our country lacks oil and oil products. Everything is not easy, but now everything will be provided. By the way, Ilham Aliyev and President Erdoğan offered to organize talks with Russia. This can only be commended. And also the President of Switzerland, the Prime Minister of Greece, Prime Minister of the Netherlands Rutte... It seems that Ukraine has gained the sincerity and attention of the entire normal civilized world. What is the practical result? Here it is - SWIFT. There is so much sense in this word for the Russian Federation! Disconnection from global financial civilization. Our diplomats fought around the clock and with inspiration for all European countries to agree on a strong and fair decision to disconnect Russia from the international interbank network. We also gained this victory. This is billions and billions of losses for Russia - a concrete price for this vile invasion of our state. We always said: the truth is on our side. This means that even the greatest achievements are possible. Today I spoke with the leaders of churches and religious communities of Ukraine. Metropolitan Epiphanius, Primate of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine; Metropolitan Onufriy, Primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church; Sheikh Tamim, Supreme Mufti of Ukraine; Yaakov Bleich, Chief Rabbi of Kyiv and Ukraine, and His Holiness Pope Francis, Head of the Catholic Church. All leaders pray for our defenders, for the souls of our heroes who gave their lives for our Ukraine, and for our unity and our victory. And this is very important. You know, today was a very good, sunny day in Kyiv. The day that the invaders tried to destroy for us, like everything else in the country. But today is also the first day of the life of a girl who was born in the Kyiv subway this Saturday night. Now it's a shelter. We give a decent rebuff - I'm sure you see it in the news. I want to say just one more thing. We will fight as long as it takes to liberate the country. If children are born in shelters, even when the shelling continues, then the enemy has no chance in this undoubtedly People's war. To victory! Glory to Ukraine!"
"President of Ukraine expects from Russia a full-fledged negotiation process, not the language of ultimatums - Mykhailo Podoliak",2022-02-26T17:12:00Z,"Ukraine does not refuse to negotiate with the Russian Federation, yet is ready only for a full-fledged negotiation process without unacceptable conditions and ultimatums, said Mykhailo Podoliak, Adviser to the Head of the President's Office. ""Any war inevitably ends with negotiations. Ukraine heard the negotiating position outlined in Moscow. They know our view on the negotiating format and our negotiating position. Therefore, their comments that we allegedly refused to negotiate are just part of their tactics,"" he said. Mykhailo Podoliak noted that Russia is trying to drive negotiations into a dead end before they even begin, and a different approach is needed. “Negotiations must be based on common sense and be such that a fair solution can be worked out in the interests of the people and the national statehood of Ukraine,” the Adviser to the Head of the President's Office said. At the same time, as Mykhailo Podoliak noted, by their resistance, Ukrainians have proved that driving them into a dead end is an unrealistic ambition.  “The lie of Russians that they allegedly had the order to stop is refuted by the very reality that the whole world saw on Friday night. And this morning. The fighting was fierce, at maximum intensity,” he noted. That is why President Zelenskyy categorically does not accept any unacceptable conditions and ultimatums for Ukraine.  “Only full-fledged negotiations,” Mykhailo Podoliak emphasized."
We withstood: address by the President of Ukraine on the third day of the war,2022-02-26T12:14:00Z,"I can start this address with good news. We withstood and successfully repel enemy attacks. The fighting continues. In many cities and districts of our state. But we know what we are defending. The country, the land, the future of children. Kyiv and key cities around the capital are controlled by our army. The invaders wanted to block the center of our state and put their puppets here, as in Donetsk. We broke their plan. They did not gain any advantage over us. On our streets, in the skies of Kyiv, in Vasylkiv, in Vyshhorod, even in the surrounding fields, a real battle for Kyiv took place. The enemy used everything against us: missiles, fighter aircraft, drones, artillery, armored vehicles, saboteurs, paratroopers. The invaders are shelling residential neighborhoods, including with the use of missile artillery, trying to destroy energy facilities. They have very treacherous tactics. Dwellings destroyed by missiles and artillery are the ultimate argument for the world to stop the occupation invasion together with us. I say this as frankly as possible now: the people of Ukraine have already earned and have the right to become a member of the European Union. This will be the key evidence of our country's support. It is a crucial moment to close the long-standing strategic discussion once and for all and to decide on Ukraine's membership in the European Union. I discussed this today with Charles Michel, Ursula von der Leyen, Emmanuel Macron. The anti-war coalition is operating - defense weapons and equipment are heading to Ukraine. We already have almost full support from EU countries for disconnecting Russia from SWIFT. I hope that Germany and Hungary will have the courage to support this decision. We have the courage to defend our homeland, to defend Europe. In each of our cities, the invaders are being severely rebuffed. Uman, Odesa, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Donbas, Kharkiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, Kyiv - wherever the enemy kills our people, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are doing everything to stop and destroy the invaders. Lviv and other cities in western and central Ukraine that are under air attacks endure firmly. Well done! Every Ukrainian needs to remember one thing. If you can stop and destroy the invaders, do it. All those who can return to Ukraine, come back to defend Ukraine. And then we will have a lot of work with you to rebuild it! All those who can defend Ukraine abroad, do it purposefully, unitedly, continuously! All friends of Ukraine who want to join the defense - come, we will give you weapons! All the details of how to implement this will be announced in the near future. Glory to all those who defend Ukraine today! You are heroes! I adopted a decision to posthumously award the title of Hero of Ukraine to Vitaliy Volodymyrovych Skakun, a sapper of the 35th Separate Marine Brigade. At the cost of his own life, he blew up the bridge. And now I want absolutely everyone in Russia to hear me. Thousands of victims. Hundreds of prisoners who simply cannot understand why they were sent to Ukraine. Sent to be killed. The sooner you tell your government that the war must be stopped immediately, the more of your people will remain alive. We see that there are indeed protests by your citizens against the war. We know that many in Russia are now simply shocked by the meanness and cruelty of the authorities. This is a truly correct response. I thank you for this reaction. Thanks to Leonid Parfyonov, Dmitry Muratov, Yury Dud, Liya Akhedzhakova, Valery Meladze and thousands, thousands of other Russians whose conscience is heard loud. Just stop those who lie to you, lie to us, lie to the whole world. We need to end this war. We can live in peace - in global peace, in human peace. Our military, national guards, national police, territorial defense, border guards, special services, citizens - hold on! We will defeat everyone. Glory to Ukraine!"
Mykhailo Podolyak on the Russian invasion: Russian troops have not gained any operational and tactical advantage in Ukraine,2022-02-26T09:30:00Z,"The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation have not gained any operational and tactical advantage over the past 24 hours, which indicates that Ukraine is winning. This was stated by Adviser to the Head of the President's Office Mykhailo Podoliak. ""We understood that tonight would be difficult, because Russia planned to use and used all its resources and reserves to inflict maximum damage on us in the maximum number of our cities. I will say at once that this did not happen - the Armed Forces of Ukraine together with the National Police of Ukraine completely control the whole situation and the territory of our state,"" he stressed. According to the Adviser to the Head of the President's Office, heavy fighting continues in the south in the cities of Kherson, Mykolaiv and Odesa. Russia considers this direction a priority. ""They wanted to establish themselves there, but there is no hint that they succeeded,"" said Mykhailo Podoliak. Also, according to him, the direction of Kyiv remains a priority for Russia, as the goal of the special operation of the Russian Federation is to destroy the political and military leadership of Ukraine. ""For this reason, there was an attempt to draw the maximum amount of equipment and forces of the Russian Armed Forces to the city of Kyiv. At the moment, we can say the following: the situation in the city and on the outskirts of the city is under control,"" said the Adviser to the Head of the President's Office. He added that there are some enemy subversive reconnaissance units against which the police and representatives of the Territorial Defense Forces are actively working. In addition, the Armed Forces are actively working on the outskirts of Kyiv. According to Mykhailo Podoliak, fierce fighting continues around the city of Mariupol in the southern direction. ""But there is no chance that Mariupol will side with the Russian Federation or be captured by the Russian armed forces at the moment,"" he said. In addition, according to the Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President, air alarms are constantly working in many cities of the country, because the Russian army uses missile artillery and aircraft for direct strikes on Ukrainian cities. ""However, as of 7 am, February 26, despite the amount of resources and reserves that were thrown into the active offensive of the Russian Federation, the armed forces of this country did not receive any operational and tactical advantage. This shows that Ukraine has not just survived - Ukraine is winning"" he said. Mykhailo Podoliak stressed that Ukraine's defense is actively carried out by the Armed Forces, the National Police and the Territorial Defense. ""People know how to defend their country. President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy is working on a regular basis. Today, as in the last two days, he will hold a series of important talks with representatives of our Western partners in order to form the most effective coalition against the Russian Federation,"" he said. The Adviser to the Head of the President's Office noted that the country is controlled, and this is very important, because the enemy uses a lot of disinformation to make Ukrainians lose faith in their victory."
Address by the President of Ukraine in the evening of the second day of the large-scale war,2022-02-26T00:38:00Z,"Today was a hard yet courageous day. We are fighting for our state absolutely on all frontlines: South, East, North, in many cities of our beautiful country. Fighting around the clock on the diplomatic frontline as well - it's easier to say with whom I did not speak to among world leaders today. We continue this. I have been constantly working and spoke with President Macron, Scholz, Rutte, Mrs. von der Leyen, President of the United States Biden. I outlined what answer Ukrainians still expect from the West to this aggression and agreed on new assistance, new support, significant assistance for our state. I thank all the leaders and I am separately grateful to President Biden. I was really glad to see the news from friendly Georgia. I want to thank the good, beautiful Georgian people who went out on the streets of their country and supported Ukraine. You are true friends! Thanks. Our main goal is to end this slaughter. The enemy suffers very-very serious losses. These are hundreds, hundreds of killed soldiers who crossed our border, who came to our land. We suffer losses as well, unfortunately. Ukrainians resist the aggression heroically. It is impossible to justify. Therefore, the invaders have to come up with more and more absurd accusations to say at least something. I am convinced that these allegations are biased, nobody will believe them. Ukrainians won't believe them, the world won’t believe them, citizens of the Russian Federation won’t believe them. It's simply cannot be such a truth that could clarify why kindergartens and housing infrastructure are fired from a missile artillery. In Vorzel, Kyiv region, they fired ""Grads"" at an orphanage. Okhtyrka, Sumy region, was shelled by ""Uragans"". Housing quarters, shelter, kindergartens were under the shelling. What is this war against Ukrainian children in a kindergarten? Who are they? Are they neo-Nazis from kindergarten as well? Or were they NATO soldiers that threatened Russia? Killed and injured children are the sentence to this invasion. Everyone, I emphasize, everyone must do everything they can to stop this war. Every day of aggression destroys normal life not only in Ukraine, but also in Russia, and in Europe, in the world. Europeans do not imagine yet what it is like to live when there is such a confrontation next to you. I have to say absolutely frankly: this night will be harder than a day. Many cities of our state are under attack. Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, our boys, our girls in Donbas, cities of the south of Ukraine. Kyiv requires special attention. We cannot lose the capital. I appeal to our defenders on all frontlines. This night the enemy will use all the forces available to break our resistance. Treacherously, viciously, inhumanly. This night they will make an assault upon us. We all have to understand what we are going to face. This night we have to withstand. The fate of Ukraine is now being decided. Each civilian should be as careful as possible. Help, please, each other, especially elderly people, lonely, those for whom it is very difficult now. In case of any danger go to the shelter. Everyone who has already joined the country's defense or can help defend, stop the enemy everywhere you can. Remove special signs that saboteurs leave on the roads and buildings. Burn the enemy’s equipment with anything you can. If even kindergartens are a permissible target for invaders, you must not leave them any chance. All thoughts, all prayers of Ukrainians are with our military. We believe in them, take care of them. Defend our state. The night will be tough, very tough. But the morning will come. Glory to Ukraine!"
Tactics of Russian troops resembles terrorist methods when shelling of residential neighborhoods and kindergartens is carried out - Mykhailo Podolyak,2022-02-25T21:13:00Z,"The Armed Forces of Ukraine, the National Police and the Territorial Defense work well to maintain control over much of Ukraine's territory, which has been attacked by the Russian Federation. This was stated by Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Mykhailo Podoliak at a briefing in the Office of the Head of State. ""If we compare the military potentials of Ukraine and Russia, we are holding the line very effectively. Our enemies want to solve the key task - to capture Kyiv and the main cities of the east and south of the country. We know their plans, and the leadership of the Armed Forces especially understands them,"" he said. According to Mykhailo Podoliak, the tactics used by the Russian armed forces partly resembles terrorist methods when shelling of residential neighborhoods is carried out, and today even shelling of kindergartens took place. ""War crimes, which unfortunately took place as of today, must receive a strict legal assessment,"" he said. The Adviser to the Head of the President's Office reiterated that the enemy will not be able to implement its plans to eliminate the leadership of the Ukrainian state and create chaos in the country. He confirmed that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in Kyiv and is effectively managing the country and defense. ""Yesterday, the day before yesterday, today he works around the clock. He has regular meetings with other leaders of the country - the Cabinet of Ministers, deputies, as well as regular consultations with world leaders. The President is aware of everything that is happening in the country and makes operational decisions on governing the country,"" Mykhailo Podoliak said. He also said that the most difficult situation now is in the Kharkiv direction, in the Sumy region and in the south of the country, where quite heavy fighting continues between the Armed Forces and Russian troops. The Adviser to the Head of the President's Office noted that, according to preliminary data, more than a thousand servicemen of the aggressor country were killed today, which is quite a large number. ""Today he (President of Ukraine - ed.) is negotiating with world leaders in order to form the maximum fund of support for our Armed Forces by our partners,"" Mykhailo Podoliak stressed. During the briefing, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal informed about an extraordinary government meeting, which adopted a number of necessary decisions to equip and supply the army, ensure stable operation of hospitals and critical infrastructure during martial law. In particular, the State Treasury of Ukraine together with the Ministry of Finance will redistribute funds to strengthen national security and defense, carry out the necessary priority measures and payments. ""The government has decided to carry out state domestic borrowing in the amount of up to 400 billion hryvnias through the gradual issuance of military bonds,"" he said. Additional funding was provided for the military, privates and commanders, and it was decided that the eSupport program, which accrues for the full vaccination course, could be used to help the army by transferring it to the International Charitable Foundation Return Alive or to a special account of the National Bank. ""Ports of Ukraine are under increased protection. The government has established the third level of protection in sea and river ports of Ukraine, in port facilities and on vessels that have the right to sail under the flag of Ukraine, for the period of martial law,"" he added. Also, according to the government's decision, for the period of martial law, the leaders of the territorial defense zone have the right to decide for themselves what and how much humanitarian aid is needed. The State Customs Service and border guards must ensure the immediate passage of such assistance to hospitals, the Armed Forces and the Territorial Defense Forces. In addition, a temporary cessation of exports of blood products has been introduced, and the Ministry of Health will approve the scope of mandatory provision of health care needs with donated blood and blood products. Denys Shmyhal called on international partners to unite and stop the aggressor and its war against Ukraine. ""We call on all civilized countries to impose an embargo on Russian oil products, ban Russian citizens from entering your territory and disconnect Russia from SWIFT. We call on NATO, Europe, the United States to close the sky over Ukraine - this will not mean your military confrontation with Russia, this will mean that you have stopped the war, and your descendants will remember you as heroes. For our part, we will continue to defend our own land, we will not give up and we will destroy our enemies,"" the head of government stressed."
Address by the President of Ukraine,2022-02-25T13:07:00Z,"Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz yesterday said Russia's invasion of Ukraine is something Europe has not seen for 75 years. And it's true. But this is not the whole truth. This is not just Russia's invasion in Ukraine, this is the beginning of the war against Europe. Against the unity of Europe. Against elementary human rights in Europe. Against all coexistence rules on the continent. Against the fact that European states refuse to divide, yes, to divide the borders by force. The cities of Ukraine undergo rocket bombing for the second day already. Tank columns and air strikes are as similar as something Europe has already seen a long time ago - during the Second World War and talked ""never again"" about it. But this is it! Again. Now. In 2022. 75 years after the Second World War completion. I'm confident you see it - all of you, entire Europe. But we do not see in full what you are going to do. How are you going to protect yourself when you help us so slowly in Ukraine? I’d like to point out what has already happened. And for this we are grateful. Sectoral sanctions. The United States, Canada, United Kingdom, the European Union, Australia and New Zealand introduced precisely sectoral sanctions against Russia. In particular, against all the largest banks. Against the largest Russian enterprises. Against Russia's access to Western technologies. But Russian tanks are still shooting at residential buildings in our cities. Armored vehicles are still attacking, including civilians. Ordinary citizens of Ukraine. Europe has sufficient force to stop this aggression. What to expect from European states further? Cancellation of visas for Russians? Cutting off Swift? Full isolation of Russia? Recalling ambassadors? Oil embargo? Closure of the sky? Today, all this should be on the table, because it is a threat to us, all of us, all of Europe. You can still stop aggression. We must act without delay. Ordinary people can also do their part of the job, I'm sure, in every country of the world, in each country of Europe. Go out on the square of your cities and demand peace for Europe, peace for Ukraine, stop this war. Go out, go out on the squares and demand to stop the war. This is our right. This is your right. When bombs fall in Kyiv, this happens in Europe, not only in Ukraine. When missiles kill our people, it's the death of all Europeans. Require more protection for Europe, more protection for Ukraine - as part of a democratic world. While state institutions in Europe are in no hurry with really strong decisions, every European in the capital can already come to our embassy and offer assistance. Demand from your governments more financial, more military assistance to Ukraine. For this help is a help to you. For it is a help to Europe. You help yourself. If you have a combat experience in Europe and do not want to look at the indecision of politicians, you can arrive in our state and protect Europe with us where it is now urgently required. You have already been blackmailed with gas. Already humiliated. They already want to split and divide you the same way as they are trying to divide Ukraine today. Protect yourself. Just as we protect yourself. I want to address Russian Federation President once again. Battles take place all over the territory of Ukraine. Let's sit at the negotiating table. To stop the death of people. And now I want to address the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Stand firmly. You are all we have. You are everything that protects our state. Glory to Ukraine!"
Mykhailo Podolyak: Baseline scenario of Russian attack on Ukraine is to enter Kyiv and liquidate the state leadership,2022-02-25T11:44:00Z,"Baseline scenario of the special operation of the Russian Federation against Ukraine is to enter Kyiv and liquidate the leadership of the state. But President Volodymyr Zelenskyy remains in the capital to show the sustainability of the Ukrainian people. This was said by Advisor to the Head of the Office of the President Mykhailo Podolyak at a briefing at the President's Office. ""Today, the baseline scenario of the special operation of the Russian Federation is clear. The only goal is to enter Kyiv and liquidate the leadership of Ukraine, personally Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This is the purpose of the special operation. Therefore, there is such a crazy pressure on Kyiv. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy remains in Kyiv, because he must show the endurance of the Ukrainian people,"" said Mykhail Podolyak.   He emphasized that Ukrainian soldiers continue to strongly resist the enemy and do not give up ""an inch of land"". ""This applies not only to Zmiinyi, this applies to each piece of our land. Ukraine is precisely a state, and today it confirmed that,"" said Advisor to the Head of the President's Office. According to him, the state banking sector works. ""Only the branches in the cities where there are fighting collisions or those on a clash line do not work,"" said Mykhailo Podolyak. Mobile communication, energy and water supply operate in regular mode. All malfunctions are eliminated by repair brigades. ""Transport, key roads operate in regular mode. Of course, they have some traffic jams, because panic moods, regretfully, are there, too,""said Advisor to the Head of the President’s Office. He said that in Ukraine ports are closed and aviation has been stopped, but most trains run in accordance with the schedule. ""The availability of fuel is a problem. There are limits, there are queues at petrol stations, we are talking directly about it. Regarding the groceries - currently there is a sufficient quantity of goods in stores. They will be replenished, at least in those places where fighting does not happen today. The main networks of pharmacy distributors do not work, but the pharmacies themselves work,"" said Mykhailo Podolyak. The Advisor to the Head of the Presidential Office emphasized that all energy facilities are protected and operating under the supervision of the state. ""We have a completely controlled situation in Ukraine. This is the key thing,"" he summed up."
Address by the President on the second morning of the large-scale war,2022-02-25T07:27:00Z,"The second morning of a large-scale war. At 4 am, Russian forces continued to launch missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine. They say that civilian objects are not a target for them. This is a lie. In fact, they do not distinguish in which areas to operate. Just as yesterday, the military and civilians are equally under Russian attack. The purpose of this attack is to put pressure on you, the citizens of Ukraine, to put pressure on our entire society. I emphasize: not just on the government - on all Ukrainians. And today - even more than yesterday. Our men and women - all defenders of Ukraine - did not allow the enemy to realize the operational plan of invasion on the first day. Ukrainians demonstrate real heroism. The enemy was stopped in most directions. There are fights. Therefore, Russia's attack continues with the expectation that our forces will be tired. But no one is tired. Ukraine's air defense forces are protecting our sky. As much as possible. Enemy aircraft operate treacherously over residential areas, including the capital. Terrible explosions in the morning sky over Kyiv, bombing, hitting a house, fire - all this reminds of the first such attack on our capital, which took place in 1941. This morning we are defending our state alone, as we did yesterday. The world's most powerful forces are watching from afar. Did yesterday's sanctions convince Russia? We hear in our sky and see on our earth that this is not enough. Foreign troops are still trying to become more active in our territory. Only the solidarity and determination of Ukrainians can preserve our freedom and protect the state. The army, border guards, the National Guard, the police, intelligence, the Territorial Defense Forces - everyone performs their tasks to the maximum. It is very important that today our citizens also demonstrate maximum endurance and mutual support. Take care of your family and loved ones, but do not forget about the people around you. Those who are single, those who are older. Help them with food. Help find shelter when there is an air alarm. Help with access to verified official information. Stop the enemy wherever you see it. The fate of Ukraine depends only on Ukrainians. No one but ourselves will control our lives. We are on our land, the truth is on our side. It will not be possible to destroy our character. Kalibr missiles are helpless against our freedom. Russia will still have to talk to us sooner or later. Talk about how to end the fighting and stop this invasion. The sooner the conversation begins, the smaller Russia's losses will be. Dear citizens of the Russian Federation. As I said, tonight they started bombing residential areas of the hero city of Kyiv. It all reminds me of 1941. To all the citizens of the Russian Federation who come out to protest, I want to say - we see you. This means that you heard us. This means that you begin to trust us. Fight for us. Fight against the war. Dear citizens of Ukraine. We are defending ourselves! We do not stop! Glory to you! Glory to our army! Glory to Ukraine!"
Address by the President to Ukrainians at the end of the first day of Russia's attacks,2022-02-25T01:10:00Z,"Glory to the Armed Forces of Ukraine! Men and women, our defenders! You are brilliantly defending the country from one of the most powerful countries in the world. Today Russia attacked the entire territory of our state. And today our defenders have done a lot. They defended almost the entire territory of Ukraine, which suffered direct blows. They regain the one that the enemy managed to occupy. For example, Hostomel near Kyiv. This gives more confidence to the capital. According to preliminary data, unfortunately, we have lost 137 of our heroes today - our citizens. 10 of them are officers. 316 are wounded. On our Zmiinyi Island, defending it to the last, all the border guards died heroically. But did not give up. All of them will be posthumously awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. May the memory of those who gave their lives for Ukraine live forever. I am grateful to everyone who saves people right now and helps maintain order in the state. The enemy strikes not only at military facilities, as it claims, but also at civilians. They kill people and turn peaceful cities into military targets. This is vile and will never be forgiven. I know that a lot of fakes are being produced now. In particular, that I allegedly left Kyiv. I stay in the capital, I stay with my people. During the day, I held dozens of international talks, directly managed our country. And I will stay in the capital. My family is also in Ukraine. My children are also in Ukraine. My family is not traitors. They are the citizens of Ukraine. But I have no right to say where they are now. According to our information, the enemy marked me as the number one target. My family is the number two target. They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the Head of State. We also have information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv. That's why I am asking Kyivites very much: be careful, follow the rules of curfew. I remain in the government quarter together with all those who are necessary for the work of the central government. No matter how many conversations I had with the leaders of different countries today, I heard a few things. The first is that we are supported. And I am grateful to each state that helps Ukraine concretely, not just in words. But there is another - we are left alone in defense of our state. Who is ready to fight with us? Honestly - I do not see such. Who is ready to guarantee Ukraine's accession to NATO? Honestly, everyone is afraid. Today we heard from Moscow that they still want to talk. They want to talk about Ukraine's neutral status. I tell all the partners of our state: now is an important moment - the fate of our country is being decided. I ask them: are you with us? They answer that they are with us. But they are not ready to take us to the Alliance. Today, I asked the twenty-seven leaders of Europe whether Ukraine will be in NATO. I asked directly. Everyone is afraid. They do not answer. And we are not afraid of anything. We are not afraid to defend our state. We are not afraid of Russia. We are not afraid to talk to Russia. We are not afraid to say everything about security guarantees for our state. We are not afraid to talk about neutral status. We are not in NATO now. But the main thing - what security guarantees will we have? And what specific countries will give them? We need to talk about the end of this invasion. We need to talk about a ceasefire. But now the fate of the country depends entirely on our army, on our heroes, our security forces, all our defenders. And on our people, your wisdom and the great support of all friends of our country. Glory to Ukraine!"
Western partners must help close the sky over Ukraine to stop Russian aggression: Mykhailo Podoliak,2022-02-24T21:01:00Z,"Ukraine calls on its Western partners to help close the sky over our country in order to stop the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation. This was stated by Adviser to the Head of the President's Office Mykhailo Podoliak. ""This applies to our Western partners. If we want to stop the powerful full-scale expansion of the Russian Federation, which could lead to thousands of victims, we must close the sky over Ukraine. This is key,"" he said. Also, according to the Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President, it is necessary to block the financial flows that Russia uses today.

For his part, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said that at an extraordinary government meeting in Kyiv a decision was made to implement a plan of civil protection under martial law. ""The decision was made for the most effective defense of the state and protection of the population in the context of hostilities against the Russian aggressor,"" he said. According to the Prime Minister, the decision allows to coordinate as much as possible all authorities, regional state administrations in martial law. In addition, it will help allocate all the necessary resources, quickly and efficiently use them for the needs of defense, our military. The Regional State Administrations have been instructed to intensify evacuation work in areas of active hostilities. Special services are working to help Ukrainians who have been forced to evacuate. The Prime Minister also noted that the financial and economic bloc of the government is working with the NBU to make payments on the so-called list of critical imports that Ukraine needs to ensure livelihood in hostilities. He stressed that today the government is working responsibly, and Supreme Commander-in-Chief, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy is fully in charge of the Armed Forces.

Address by the President of Ukraine,2022-02-24T18:01:00Z,"Citizens of Ukraine. What do we hear today? It's not just rocket explosions, battles, the roar of aircraft. It is the sound of a new Iron Curtain lowering and closing Russia away from the civilized world. Our national task is to make this curtain pass not through our Ukrainian territory, but at the home of Russians. The Ukrainian army, our border guards, police and special services stopped the enemy's attacks. In the language of conflict, this can be called an operational pause. In Donbas, our Armed Forces are doing great, the Kharkiv direction is very difficult, the forces for the defense of the city are working, they are reliable, they are our men. The most problematic situation today is in the south. Our troops are fighting fierce battles in the suburbs of Kherson. The enemy is pushing out of the occupied Crimea, trying to advance towards Melitopol. In the north of the country, the enemy is slowly advancing in the Chernihiv region, but there are forces to hold it. Reliable defense is built in the Zhytomyr region. Enemy paratroopers in Hostomel are blocked, troops are ordered to destroy them. Yes, we, unfortunately, have losses, losses of our heroes. Yes, we have captured Russian soldiers. Our doctors are helping some of them - those who have surrendered. Many Russian aircraft and many armored vehicles were destroyed. Yes, we see that many Russians are shocked by what is happening. Some Russians are already calling on social media that they are against the war. We see it. But the leadership of the Russian Federation is unlikely to see it. So please. If you hear us, if you understand us, if you understand that you are attacking an independent country, please go out to the squares and address the President of your country. We are Ukrainians. We are on our land. You are Russians. Now your military has started a war. The war in our state. I would very much like you to speak on Red Square or somewhere else on the streets of your capital, in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia. Not only in Instagram - it is very important. What do we see at this hour? For the world community, Russia is becoming an analogue of the so-called DPR - this is complete isolation. I am in constant contact with the leaders of partner countries and international organizations. Russia has already begun receiving the first sanctions from a large package of sanctions, the most powerful in world history. No one will be able to convince or force us, Ukrainians, to give up our freedom, our independence, our sovereignty. But it seems that the Russian leadership is trying to do this by destroying the potential of their country. Everything that Russia has done since 2000 can now be burned live in front of the world. We emphasize that Ukraine did not choose the path of war. But Ukraine offers to return to peace. What can Ukrainians do? Help the national defense. Join the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and territorial defense units. Any citizen with combat experience will now be useful. It is up to you and all of us whether the enemy will be able to advance further into the territory of our independent state. Please help the volunteer community and the medical system, for example by donating blood. Politicians and community leaders - help people, ensure normal life on the ground as much as possible. Everyone should take care of their loved ones and take care of those neighbors or acquaintances who need it. The duty of journalists, an important duty, is to defend democracy and freedom in Ukraine. I spoke today with many leaders - the United Kingdom, Turkey, France, Germany, the EU, the United States, Sweden, Romania, Poland, Austria and others. If you, dear European leaders, dear world leaders, leaders of the free world, do not help us today, then tomorrow the war will knock on your door. Glory to the Armed Forces of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"
"Ukraine severed diplomatic relations with Russia, which treacherously attacked it; our country will defend itself and will not give up its freedom - Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-02-24T14:13:00Z,"The state of Ukraine severed diplomatic relations with the Russian Federation, which treacherously attacked it at 5 am on February 24. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy at a briefing at the Office of the Head of State. ""This morning has gone down in history, but this story is completely different for our country and for Russia. We have severed diplomatic relations with Russia. Ukraine is defending itself and will not give up its freedom, no matter what Moscow thinks. For Ukrainians, independence and the right to live on their land according to their will is the highest value. Russia treacherously and self-destructively attacked our state in the morning. Just like Nazi Germany did during the Second World War,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. According to him, from today Ukraine and Russia are on different sides of world history, because the Russian Federation is on the path of evil. At the same time, according to the President, much depends on the Russian people now. ""Today, the citizens of Russia will choose which way each of them personally is on,"" he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on all Russian citizens who have not yet ""lost their conscience"" to come out and protest against this war with Ukraine. He also asked Ukrainians who have relatives, friends, acquaintances, journalists, bloggers in Russia to address them with appropriate appeals and information so that the Russian Federation knows the truth."
Servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other law enforcement agencies do not yield to the Russian troops and oppose them - Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President,2022-02-24T14:10:00Z,"In the framework of repelling the military operation by the Russian Federation against Ukraine, there are currently four dangerous directions - the Crimean Isthmus, the JFO area, the directions of Chernihiv and Kharkiv. This was announced by Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President Oleksiy Arestovych at a briefing in the Office of the President. Currently, the most successful situation for the Ukrainian side is in the area of the JFO - all attacks are repulsed there, the line of defense is not broken. Despite the reports and statements of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, Ukraine has preserved Shchastya - many armored vehicles of the enemy are destroyed there, there are losses of their manpower as well. In addition, Russian troops, according to preliminary data, have crossed the isthmus with the Crimean peninsula and are developing an offensive in two directions, but are moving slowly. ""The first is towards Melitopol, the second is towards Kherson. They are now lined up in marching columns and preparing to move. There are our troops there, and they will resist, they will defend. Of course, I will not say the details of where they are located, but it will not be easy for them - we will stop them,"" said the Adviser to the Head of the President's Office. Oleksiy Arestovych also noted that the invaders hang their flags on buildings to shoot and post propaganda videos, but the Armed Forces oppose them. Separate advanced detachments of the Russian Armed Forces, numbering two or three tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, and several dozen servicemen have appeared in the Belarusian direction. They try to enter Ukrainian territory, but face resistance and withdraw. ""We can't say that they are advancing, but the Armed Forces and other military formations are monitoring the situation,"" he said. The Adviser to the Head of the President's Office also denied the report that the border in the Volyn direction had been breached: border guards are being fired on, but there is no breakthrough. In the north of the Chernihiv region, closer to the administrative border with the Sumy region, the advance of enemy troops at a distance of 10-20 km was recorded. ""They are now, most likely, preparing, building battle formations, and will try to advance further, but Kyiv is well protected, especially from the Chernihiv direction,"" Oleksiy Arestovych stressed. Also, according to him, the military of the Armed Forces and the National Guard continue to defend Kharkiv. Adviser to the Head of the President's Office also said that there is no paratroopers landing from the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, the Zmiinyi Island is kept by Ukrainian border guards and the military. ""No warrior of the Armed Forces and other law enforcement agencies yields, everyone fights, there is no surrender or escape,"" he said. According to Oleksiy Arestovych, there are even heroic stories, such as conscripts of the National Guard, 18-year-old soldiers who have not yet studied the general military battle, destroyed four tanks of the Russian Federation. He also noted that more than 40 servicemen have been killed so far, and several dozen have been wounded, mostly due to air strikes this morning."

Adviser to the Head of the President's Office Mykhailo Podoliak added that a cash withdrawal limit of UAH 100,000 has been introduced. ""There were some interruptions a few hours ago with the possibility to pay for goods or services by card. These are all local manifestations of cyberattacks, which are accompanied by military attacks on our industries. In the banking sector, everything is sufficiently controlled,"" he said. Mykhailo Podoliak also said that the energy sector is operating normally. ""Nuclear power plants, hydroelectric power plants operate normally. There is increased security, but it has been strengthened for several weeks. Today, of course, there is additional protection. We don't have any blackouts yet,"" he said."

The Armed Forces are actively resisting the troops of the Russian Federation, which carried out a treacherous attack on our state. This was announced by Adviser to the Head of the President's Office Mykhailo Podoliak at a briefing in the press center of the President's Office. ""At 5 am, Mr. Putin actually declared war against Ukraine. He did it for no reason. There was no reason to declare war against Ukraine unilaterally. Only fake reasons used by Russian propaganda,"" he said. According to Mykhailo Podoliak, Russian troops using artillery systems began to bomb military infrastructure on the territory of Ukraine, airports, airfields, warehouses and military facilities of the Ukrainian army. After that, ground operations of the Russian armed forces began in part violating Ukraine's state border in several regions. ""President Volodymyr Zelenskyy immediately convened the Military Cabinet, the National Security and Defense Council. All the necessary decisions were made in terms of the logistics of the counter-operation against the armed forces of the Russian Federation, and martial law was imposed in Ukraine. These are concrete actions to protect our territorial integrity,"" said the Adviser to the Head of the President's Office.

In some areas, the Russian armed forces have been repulsed. The Armed Forces were ready for all of Russia's scenario plans and are now actively resisting. This resistance will be growing,"" said the Adviser to the Head of the President's Office. Mykhailo Podoliak also called on the media to carefully check the information they publish or broadcast. ""Because to date no one has canceled the information war waged by Russia against Ukraine. Unfortunately, some Ukrainian media outlets are reprinting propaganda materials of the Russian Federation,"" he said. For his part, Adviser to the Head of the President's Office Oleksiy Arestovych noted that according to preliminary estimates, Russia's first blow failed. ""As for cities, geography is Ivano-Frankivsk, Khmelnytskyi, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Odesa, Mykolaiv, Kherson, Kramatorsk and directly along the JFO area,"" he said. Oleksiy Arestovych noted that, according to preliminary information, the enemy slightly advanced at a distance of up to 5 kilometers in the north of the Kharkiv region and Chernihiv region. The enemy's advance was repulsed in the Volyn direction. According to the Adviser to the Head of the President's Office, the losses of the Ukrainian side did not reduce the combat effectiveness of the Armed Forces and other law enforcement agencies. ""The Armed Forces are ready. The President is working. He runs the country and is in constant contact with international partners, who are now taking steps internationally to punish the Russian Federation for the full-scale military aggression it has committed,"" he said."

"Russia has launched a new military operation against our state, martial law is being imposed throughout Ukraine",2022-02-24T06:59:00Z,"This morning Russia launched a new military operation against our state. This is an unjustified deceitful and cynical invasion. There are strikes on military and other important defense facilities, border units are under attack, the situation in the Donbas has degraded. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, all special and law enforcement agencies of the state are on alert. The National Security and Defense Council is working in an emergency mode. Martial law will be imposed. Our diplomats are informing the world about what is happening. Ukrainians will never give up their freedom and independence to anyone. Only we, all citizens of Ukraine, have been determining our future since 1991. But now the fate of not only our state is being decided, but also what life in Europe will be like. Whether at least something of the force of international law remains will depend on the world's fair and just response to this aggression. Civilians of Ukraine should stay at home. Warn your loved ones about what is happening. Take care of those who need help. All thoughts and prayers are with our soldiers. Glory to Ukraine!"

Volodymyr Zelenskyy: I know exactly how our army will act - we are ready for anything,2022-02-23T17:17:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasizes that the Ukrainian army is ready for any scenario, but the details will not be disclosed. The President made this statement to the media following a meeting with the Presidents of Poland and Lithuania in Kyiv. ""Only I and our army will know the clear steps regarding the defense of our state. And believe me, we are ready for anything,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. The Head of State noted that he could not predict the personal decisions of the President of Russia or the actions of Russian-controlled formations in the occupied territories of Donbas. According to him, since the Budapest Memorandum is no longer working, Ukraine needs new security guarantees. ""It is no secret that Budapest is not working. We clearly understand that currently Ukraine is not in any of the security alliances. We protect Ukraine ourselves with the support of our partners. But it is Ukrainians who are dying. That is why Ukraine needs security guarantees, clear, concrete, right now,” the President said. ""It is very important to have the support of other partners. And given that we now have 150,000 Russian troops on the border, temporarily occupied territories, I believe that Russia should be among those countries that provide clear security guarantees. It is no secret, I have repeatedly invited the President of Russia to sit down at the negotiating table and speak. Because this is a matter of dialogue, not a matter of conditions,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy added."
"Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania share the view that the future of European security is now being decided in Ukraine - Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-02-23T16:57:00Z,"During a meeting with President of the Republic of Poland Andrzej Duda and President of the Republic of Lithuania Gitanas Nausėda, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy discussed the consequences of the Russian Federation's actions for European and regional security and coordinated efforts to counter Russian aggression.  The President of Ukraine stressed that the personal presence in Kyiv of true friends of Ukraine Andrzej Duda and Gitanas Nausėda is very important and valuable at this difficult time. ""We have discussed the consequences of Russia's actions for European and regional security. We share the view that the future of European security is now being decided at home, in Ukraine. We've coordinated our efforts to counter Russian aggression and de-escalate the conflict,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. He noted that Poland and Lithuania support Ukraine not only in words, but also in deeds, and make an important contribution to increasing the defense capabilities of our country. ""The protective helmets, ammunition and Stinger man-portable anti-aircraft missile systems handed over to our security and defense forces are the help that the Ukrainian military needs right now,"" the President said. In addition, the President of Ukraine expressed gratitude for the fact that Lithuanian and Polish diplomats keep working in Ukraine, and this is an important signal. “We also appreciate the immediate and clear reaction of Warsaw and Vilnius to the recent decisions of the Russian Federation to recognize the ""independence"" of quasi-entities, the so-called LPR and DPR, and to allow the use of Russian troops outside the Russian Federation. We are united in our assessments of these crimes, these decisions of the Russian Federation. This is another act of aggression against Ukraine, against our sovereignty, our territorial integrity. This is the legitimization of the military presence of the Russian Federation in the temporarily occupied Donbas, which had been concealed behind separatist chevrons for eight years. This is a unilateral withdrawal of the Russian Federation from the Minsk agreements and an undermining of many years of international efforts to peacefully resolve the situation in the Ukrainian Donbas,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. The President is convinced that the response of the international community to this another one crime of Russia must be decisive, tough and urgent. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that Ukraine welcomes the decisions to impose new sanctions against Russia, which were adopted by the European Union, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. ""We look forward to further steps of increasing sanctions pressure against Russia,"" he added. Germany's decision to stop the certification of Nord Stream 2 is also important. ""It must become irreversible and completely stop this project, which is a weapon that is already being used against Ukraine and against Europe,"" the President stressed. For his part, Andrzej Duda noted that he and Gitanas Nausėda arrived in Kyiv to support Ukraine, which today faces the threat of Russian aggression. He noted that the steps taken by the President of Russia today are a threat not only to Ukraine, but also to our entire region, including the eastern flank of NATO and the EU as a whole. ""That's why we exchanged information about our initiatives and actions,"" Andrzej Duda said. The President of Poland stated that today, right in front of us, the security architecture in Europe, which has guaranteed peace in recent decades, is collapsing. The current events are a test of the unity of the European Union and NATO, so we need to demonstrate unity in order to ensure peace and security. Andrzej Duda also called on the Russian leadership to refrain from armed aggression against Ukraine. President Gitanas Nausėda added that Lithuania does not recognize any attempt to undermine Ukraine's territorial integrity. He praised the reaction of the EU and other countries to Russia's actions on recognizing the certain districts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. ""Only a serious and powerful response can stop further escalation of the conflict,"" he said. According to the Lithuanian leader, NATO must also give a clear signal that it will not change its policy on freedom of accession, and no country in the world has the right to undermine the sovereignty of another state if it wishes to join the Alliance. ""We cannot allow military force or threat to be the deciding factor,"" Gitanas Nausėda concluded."

This unprovoked aggressive step by Russia constitutes yet another blatant violation of the fundamental norms and principles of the international law, including the UN Charter, as well as security assurances given to Ukraine in the framework of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. Russia deliberately and unilaterally has withdrawn from the Minsk agreements and therefore bears full responsibility for further deterioration of the security situation on the ground. We reaffirm our strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders, extending to its territorial waters. The Russian Federation’s decision to recognise the so-called “LNR” and “DPR” will have no legal implications. We call upon the international community to take resolute and far-reaching steps in response to this yet another act of aggression committed by Russia against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. This response should include swift introduction of robust package of sanctions against the Russian Federation, including the measures targeting the Nord Stream 2. We urge Russia to de-escalate and to withdraw its armed forces deployed around Ukraine’s borders and in temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, and to refrain from taking any further military actions. The Presidents of Lithuania and Poland stand by Ukraine and fully commend and support its efforts to solve Russian-Ukrainian conflict by diplomatic and peaceful means. Ukraine deserves our strongest support of its European and Euro-Atlantic aspirations, which goes in line with the free will and choice of the Ukrainian nation. Lithuania and Poland reconfirm their support for Ukraine's European perspective, in line with respective Joint Declarations signed on 18 March and on 3 May 2021. We emphasize that, given the significant progress in the implementation of the Association Agreement and internal reforms, as well as the current security challenges, Ukraine deserves EU candidate status and the Republic of Lithuania and the Republic of Poland will support Ukraine in achieving this goal.

Speech by the President of Ukraine at the 58th Munich Security Conference,2022-02-19T18:14:00Z,"Ukraine wants peace. Europe wants peace. The world says it doesn't want to fight, and Russia says it doesn't want to attack. Someone is lying. This is not an axiom, but it is no longer a hypothesis. Ladies and Gentlemen! Two days ago I was in Donbas, on the delimitation line. Legally - between Ukraine and the temporarily occupied territories. In fact, the delimitation line between peace and war. Where on the one side there is a kindergarten, and on the other side there is a projectile that hit it. On the one side there is a school, on the other side there is a projectile hitting the school yard. And next to it there are 30 children who go… no, not to NATO, but to school. Someone has physics classes. Knowing its basic laws, even children understand how absurd the statements that the shelling is carried out by Ukraine sound. Someone has math classes. Children can calculate the difference between the number of shelling occasions in these three days and the occasions of mentioning Ukraine in this year's Munich Security Report without a calculator. And someone has history classes. And when a bomb crater appears in the school yard, children have a question: has the world forgotten its mistakes of the XX century? What do attempts at appeasement lead to? As the question ""Why die for Danzig?"" turned into the need to die for Dunkirk and dozens of other cities in Europe and the world. At the cost of tens of millions of lives. These are terrible lessons of history. I just want to make sure you and I read the same books. Hence, we have the same understanding of the answer to the main question: how did it happen that in the XXI century, Europe is at war again and people are dying? Why does it last longer than World War II? How did we get to the biggest security crisis since the Cold War? For me, as the President of a country that has lost part of the territory, thousands of people and on whose borders there are now 150,000 Russian troops, equipment and heavy weapons, the answer is obvious. The architecture of world security is fragile and needs to be updated. The rules that the world agreed on decades ago no longer work. They do not keep up with new threats. They are not effective for overcoming them. This is a cough syrup when you need a coronavirus vaccine. The security system is slow. It crashes again. Because of different things: selfishness, self-confidence, irresponsibility of states at the global level. As a result, we have crimes of some and indifference of others. Indifference that makes you an accomplice. It is symbolic that I am talking about this right here. It was here 15 years ago that Russia announced its intention to challenge global security. What did the world say? Appeasement. Result? At least - the annexation of Crimea and aggression against my state. The UN, which is supposed to defend peace and world security, cannot defend itself. When its Charter is violated. When one of the members of the UN Security Council annexes the territory of one of the founding members of the UN. And the UN itself ignores the Crimea Platform, the goal of which is to de-occupy Crimea peacefully and protect the rights of Crimeans. Three years ago, it was here that Angela Merkel said: “Who will pick up the wreckage of the world order? Only all of us, together."" The audience gave a standing ovation. But, unfortunately, the collective applause did not grow into collective action. And now, when the world is talking about the threat of a great war, the question arises: is there anything left to pick up? The security architecture in Europe and the world is almost destroyed. It's too late to think about repairs, it's time to build a new system. Mankind has done this twice, paying too high a price - two world wars. We have a chance to break this trend until it becomes a consistent pattern. And start building a new system before millions of victims. Having the old lessons of the First and Second World Wars, not our own experience of the possible third, God forbid. I talked about it here. And on the rostrum of the UN. That in the XXI century there are no more foreign wars. That the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas affects the whole world. And this is not a war in Ukraine, but a war in Europe. I said this at summits and forums. In 2019, 2020, 2021. Will the world be able to hear me in 2022? This is no longer a hypothesis, but not an axiom yet. Why? Evidence is needed. More important than words on Twitter or statements in the media. Action is required. It is the world that needs it, not just us. We will defend our land with or without the support of partners. Whether they give us hundreds of modern weapons or five thousand helmets. We appreciate any help, but everyone should understand that these are not charitable contributions that Ukraine should ask for or remind of. These are not noble gestures for which Ukraine should bow low. This is your contribution to the security of Europe and the world. Where Ukraine has been a reliable shield for eight years. And for eight years it has been rebuffing one of the world's biggest armies. Which stands along our borders, not the borders of the EU. And Grad rockets hit Mariupol, not European cities. And after almost six months of fighting, the airport in Donetsk was destroyed, not in Frankfurt. And it's always hot in the Avdiivka industrial zone - it was hot there in the last days, not in Montmartre. And no European country knows what military burials every day in all regions are. And no European leader knows what regular meetings with the families of the deceased are. Be that as it may, we will defend our beautiful land no matter if we have 50,000, 150 or one million soldiers of any army on the border. To really help Ukraine, it is not necessary to say how many servicemen and military equipment are on the border. Say what numbers we have. To really help Ukraine, it is not necessary to constantly talk only about the dates of the probable invasion. We will defend our land on February 16, March 1 and December 31. We need other dates much more. And everyone understands perfectly well which ones. Tomorrow in Ukraine is the Day of the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred. Eight years ago, Ukrainians made their choice, and many gave their lives for that choice. Eight years later, should Ukraine constantly call for recognition of the European perspective? Since 2014, Russia has been convincing that we have chosen the wrong path, that no one is waiting for us in Europe. Shouldn't Europe constantly say and prove by action that this is not true? Shouldn't the EU say today that its citizens are positive about Ukraine's accession to the Union? Why do we avoid this question? Doesn't Ukraine deserve direct and honest answers? This also applies to NATO. We are told: the door is open. But so far authorized access only. If not all members of the Alliance want to see us or all members of the Alliance do not want to see us, be honest. Open doors are good, but we need open answers, not open questions for years. Isn't the right to the truth one of our enhanced opportunities? The best time for it is the next summit in Madrid. Russia says Ukraine seeks to join the Alliance to return Crimea by force. It is gratifying that the words ""return Crimea"" appear in their rhetoric. But they inattentively read Article 5 of the NATO Charter: collective action is for protection, not offensive. Crimea and the occupied regions of Donbas will certainly return to Ukraine, but only peacefully. Ukraine consistently implements the Normandy agreements and the Minsk agreements. Their foundation is the unquestionable recognition of the territorial integrity and independence of our state. We seek a diplomatic settlement of the armed conflict. Note: solely on the basis of international law. So what is really going on in the peace process? Two years ago, we agreed with the Presidents of France, the Russian Federation, the Chancellor of Germany on a full-scale ceasefire. And Ukraine is scrupulously adhering to these agreements. We are as restrained as possible against the background of constant provocations. We are constantly making proposals in the framework of the Normandy Four and the Trilateral Contact Group. And what do we see? Shells and bullets from the other side. Our soldiers and civilians are being killed and wounded, and civilian infrastructure is being destroyed. The last days have become especially illustrative. Hundreds of massive shelling occasions with weapons prohibited by the Minsk agreements. It is also important to stop restricting the admission of OSCE observers to Ukraine's TOT. They are threatened. They are intimidated. All humanitarian issues are blocked. Two years ago, I signed a law on the unconditional admission of representatives of humanitarian organizations to detainees. But they are simply not admitted to the temporarily occupied territories. After two exchanges of captives, the process was blocked, although Ukraine provided agreed lists. Inhuman torture at the infamous Isolation Prison in Donetsk has become a symbol of human rights abuses. The two new checkpoints we opened in November 2020 in the Luhansk region still do not function - and here we see outright obstruction under contrived pretexts. Ukraine is doing everything possible to reach progress in discussions and political issues. In the TCG, in the Minsk process, we've put forward proposals - draft laws, but everything is blocked - no one talks about them. Ukraine demands to unblock the negotiation process immediately. But this does not mean that the search for peace is limited to it alone. We are ready to look for the key to the end of the war in all possible formats and platforms: Paris, Berlin, Minsk. Istanbul, Geneva, Brussels, New York, Beijing - I don't care where in the world to negotiate peace in Ukraine. It does not matter if four countries, seven or a hundred participate, the main thing is that Ukraine and Russia are among them. What is really important is the understanding that peace is needed not only by us, the world needs peace in Ukraine. Peace and restoration of territorial integrity within internationally recognized borders. This is the only way. And I hope no one thinks of Ukraine as a convenient and eternal buffer zone between the West and Russia. This will never happen. Nobody will allow that. Otherwise - who's next? Will NATO countries have to defend each other? I want to believe that the North Atlantic Treaty and Article 5 will be more effective than the Budapest Memorandum. Ukraine has received security guarantees for abandoning the world's third nuclear capability. We don't have that weapon. We also have no security. We also do not have part of the territory of our state that is larger in area than Switzerland, the Netherlands or Belgium. And most importantly - we don’t have millions of our citizens. We don’t have all this. Therefore, we have something. The right to demand a shift from a policy of appeasement to ensuring security and peace guarantees. Since 2014, Ukraine has tried three times to convene consultations with the guarantor states of the Budapest Memorandum. Three times without success. Today Ukraine will do it for the fourth time. I, as President, will do this for the first time. But both Ukraine and I are doing this for the last time. I am initiating consultations in the framework of the Budapest Memorandum. The Minister of Foreign Affairs was commissioned to convene them. If they do not happen again or their results do not guarantee security for our country, Ukraine will have every right to believe that the Budapest Memorandum is not working and all the package decisions of 1994 are in doubt. I also propose to convene a summit of permanent members of the UN Security Council in the coming weeks with the participation of Ukraine, Germany and Turkey in order to address security challenges in Europe. And elaborate new, effective security guarantees for Ukraine. Guarantees today, as long as we are not a member of the Alliance and in fact are in the gray zone - in a security vacuum. What else can we do now? Continue to effectively support Ukraine and its defense capabilities. Provide Ukraine with a clear European perspective, the tools of support available to candidate countries, and clear and comprehensive timeframes for joining the Alliance. Support the transformation in our country. Establish a Stability and Reconstruction Fund for Ukraine, a land-lease program, the supply of the latest weapons, machinery and equipment for our army - an army that protects the whole of Europe. Develop an effective package of preventive sanctions to deter aggression. Guarantee Ukraine's energy security, ensure its integration into the EU energy market when Nord Stream 2 is used as a weapon. All these questions need answers. So far we have silence instead of them. And as long as there is silence, there will be no silence in the east of our state. That is - in Europe. That is - in the whole world. I hope the whole world finally understands this, Europe understands. Ladies and Gentlemen! I thank all the states that supported Ukraine today. In words, in declarations, in concrete help. Those who are on our side today. On the side of truth and international law. I'm not calling you by name - I don't want some other countries to be ashamed. But this is their business, this is their karma. And this is on their conscience. However, I do not know how they will be able to explain their actions to the two soldiers killed and three wounded in Ukraine today. And most importantly - to three girls from Kyiv. One is ten years old, the second is six, and the third is only one. Today they were left without a father. At 6 o'clock in the morning Central European Time. When the Ukrainian intelligence officer, Captain Anton Sydorov was killed as a result of artillery fire prohibited by the Minsk agreements. I don't know what he thought at the last moment of his life. He definitely didn't know what agenda someone needs to meet to end the war. But he knows exactly the answer to the question I asked at the beginning. He knows exactly who of us is lying. May his memory live forever. May the memory of all those who died today and during the war in the east of our state live forever. Thank you."
Regarding the participation of the Head of State in the Munich Security Conference,2022-02-19T09:27:00Z,"Today, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy will pay a visit to Munich (Germany) to take part in the annual security conference and hold talks scheduled for this venue. The Head of State will, inter alia, meet with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson, Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz, Vice President of the United States Kamala Harris, representatives of international financial institutions and other partners and friends of Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy expects concrete agreements on providing our country with additional military and financial support to strengthen Ukraine's resilience. The visit is planned to be pretty dynamic, the return to Kyiv is today. Naturally, the discussions at the Munich Security Conference this year will focus on current threats in Eastern Europe and the situation around Ukraine. Therefore, the position of our state must be presented enough for the issues of Ukraine to be resolved with the participation of Ukraine. The situation on the touch line in Donbas, in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and near the borders of Ukraine is being analyzed by special services of our state. There is a constant analysis of intelligence and exchange of information with partners. Ukraine regularly receives additional up-to-date intelligence on the activity of Russian forces. The situation in the east of the country is completely controlled by the Ukrainian security and defense forces."
Ukraine wants peace and does not intend to move to the occupied territories by force - Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council,2022-02-18T22:16:00Z,"What is happening now in Donbas is an attempt by Russia to provoke our Armed Forces to take certain action, but Ukraine wants peace and does not intend to move to the occupied territories by force. This was stated by Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksiy Danilov at a briefing held at the President's Office. He stressed that there were no orders to liberate these territories by force, as this would lead to heavy casualties among the civilian population. ""There can be no such order in our country,"" Oleksiy Danilov assured. The Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council noted that the Russian Federation is deliberately escalating the situation in occupied Donetsk and Luhansk using its representatives in these territories. ""This is an attempt to provoke our Armed Forces, our troops, to the answers they would very much like us to give. We can say that troops can open fire only if there is a threat to the lives of our military,"" he said. Oleksiy Danilov stressed that there is a great threat of provocations by representatives of the Russian Federation in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. ""They can do things that have nothing to do with our military, our services,"" said the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council. At the same time, according to Oleksiy Danilov, today there is no full-scale invasion of Ukraine - ""selective provocations by the Russian Federation are possible"". ""To this end, we have an appropriate response by our Armed Forces, the security and defense sector. We are aware of the threats that exist today,"" he said. In the context of the risks of further escalation on Ukrainian territory, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council reminded that all leading countries of the world have clearly stated that in case of further invasion, they must respond immediately. ""Whether it happens or not does not depend on us. Once again, we want peace and tranquility in our country,"" Oleksiy Danilov stressed. According to him, pursuant to the instruction of President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy, representatives of the Cabinet of Ministers, the Verkhovna Rada and the National Security and Defense Council will visit the affected areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions to get themselves acquainted with the situation and help solve the problems of local residents. ""Tomorrow we will be in those places that were directly affected, where our infrastructure, schools and kindergartens were damaged,"" he said. Oleksiy Danilov stressed that Ukraine is ready to negotiate with the Russian Federation with a view to de-escalation, but not with the formations it supports in the occupied territories. After all, ""negotiating with people who do not decide anything is a waste of time."" ""We cannot negotiate with people who do not make any independent decisions - all decisions are made only in Moscow. You know that Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated that he is ready to meet with Putin at any time in order to hold these talks. Today, unfortunately, they refuse to negotiate,"" said the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council. He also stressed that Ukraine stands for the implementation of the Minsk agreements according to the defined logic, and not in the way Russia wants. For her part, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for the Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories Iryna Vereshchuk stressed that Ukraine is not an enemy for the civilians of the temporarily occupied territories of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. ""Our enemy is the Russian invader. We clearly distinguish what is happening today in the temporarily occupied territories, we see how the Russian invaders escalate the situation, creating an information background, which leads to panic,"" she said. Iryna Vereshchuk is convinced that Russia's actions regarding the announced evacuation, which is accompanied by disinformation in the Russian media, are aimed at causing unrest and panic among the population and, as a result, destabilizing the situation. The Minister said she had a working meeting with USAID representatives today. The parties discussed humanitarian response plans already approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. Iryna Vereshchuk called on citizens, who are currently in the temporarily occupied territories and are thinking about what to do in the current situation, to evacuate to the territory controlled by Ukraine. ""Come to us. Find an opportunity to cross the checkpoint. Or in another way. We are waiting for you, we will create all possible conditions for you to have a place to live, for you to have something to eat, for you to feel that you are not alone,"" said the Deputy Prime Minister. She also thanked Ukraine's international partners, including UNICEF and the Red Cross, for their assistance. Iryna Vereshchuk said that Ukraine had submitted a request for an urgent meeting of the Trilateral Contact Group. According to her, today the security group from the Ukrainian side was ready for talks. However, unfortunately, Russia refused to meet. The Deputy Prime Minister expressed hope that such a meeting would take place tomorrow. In addition, as Iryna Vereshchuk noted, Ukraine appealed to its Normandy Four partners Germany and France to strengthen the OSCE monitoring mission. ""We need independent verification. That is why we have addressed the Normandy participants and ask Germany and France to resolve the issue as soon as possible by providing representatives to the OSCE SMM who will independently assess the situation. We are ready and allow the mission to all the locations that are needed,"" she said. The Deputy Prime Minister also noted that Ukraine is ready to involve representatives of the Red Cross, international journalists - all those who have the opportunity and can be involved in the process and provide objective information about the situation."
Roman Mashovets discussed with the Ambassador of Japan to Ukraine the prospects of cooperation in the field of security and defense,2022-02-18T20:21:00Z,"Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Roman Mashovets met with Ambassador of Japan Kuninori Matsuda and discussed the security situation around Ukraine and ways to develop Ukrainian-Japanese cooperation on a wide range of security and defense issues. Roman Mashovets informed the Ambassador of Japan about the situation in eastern Ukraine, gross violations of the ceasefire by Russia, further concentration of Russian troops along the Ukrainian border and in the temporarily occupied territories, aggravation of the situation in the Black Sea region and Russia's efforts to destabilize the internal situation. He assured Kuninori Matsuda that Ukraine's security and defense forces are ready to resist Russian aggression and defend the country. The Deputy Head of the Office of the President thanked the Ambassador of Japan for the continued support to Ukraine in countering Russian aggression both at the international level, in particular within the UN and the G7, and bilaterally. Kuninori Matsuda said that the Embassy of Japan continues to work in Kyiv despite the possibility of aggravation, which is a demonstration of genuine partnership support for Ukraine and faith in the ability of the country's leadership to withstand growing threats from Russia. The Japanese diplomat noted the high level of awareness of Japanese society about the events in Ukraine and the corresponding public support of our state in Japan. Roman Mashovets thanked the Japanese side for providing assistance to Ukraine, especially in the financial, economic and medical spheres. Kuninori Matsuda announced the intention of Japanese companies to continue investing in Ukraine, in particular in the food industry, education and information technology. In the context of further development of bilateral relations in the field of security and defense, an agreement was reached on deepening cooperation in cybersecurity and the defense industry. Roman Mashovets proposed to include these issues in the agenda of the next Ukrainian-Japanese military-political consultations scheduled for spring this year. Kuninori Matsuda supported these proposals and assured of Japan's intentions to fill them with practical initiatives. The parties agreed to continue coordination of joint efforts to ensure security in the region and the development of Ukraine's security and defense sector."
"Volodymyr Zelenskyy: A global document is needed between the world's leading states, which would put Ukraine's security guarantees on paper",2022-02-17T19:12:00Z,"As long as Ukraine is not a full member of NATO, it is necessary to conclude a global document between the world's leading states, which would put security guarantees for our country on paper. This was emphasized by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an interview for RBC-Ukraine. ""We are on the path to the Alliance. NATO is, in fact, the only security alliance available today that Ukraine could join. For us, there is an ""open door"" position. But there is a long way to go - years and months, especially if there is an escalation. Going this way, we must get a system of guarantees. And at least in theory, it should be equal to the system offered to NATO countries,"" the President said. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, this issue is being discussed with all world leaders, especially those who have contacts with the Russian Federation. According to the President, this is in fact the only alternative in a situation where Ukraine is forced to defend itself, maintain a strong army during the ongoing aggression, while ensuring the viability of the state and implementing reforms. ""So if you, our partners, say that these are our common values, then let's spend money on them together. And no, it's not altruism, it's about you being next. They will go further, after which there will be a migration crisis and so on,"" he said. The Head of State assured that such a position was understood by the leading countries. ""We have raised this issue to the level of those leaders who we believe should be at this table. Who will give us guarantees, including a clause on a strong, equipped, well-financed army. These should still be the countries that would bear responsibility in case something happens - the strong ones of this world,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. According to the President, it is primarily about supporting the Ukrainian army - its funding, training, rehabilitation of the military and more. The Head of State called energy security no less important, in particular in the context of threats from the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. ""We need a global document. We will not get off with the Normandy format. The powerful ones of this world, including the United States and Russia, will sit down and sign that this is the way to go. But there should be three, four or five points about the security of our country. Then that's the talk,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy summed up."
"President: By strengthening the Ukrainian army, international partners are helping themselves as well",2022-02-17T18:36:00Z,"Ukraine not only defends its territory, but also deters further encroachments in Eastern Europe. Therefore, the weapons provided to our country by international partners are an aid to them as well, said President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an interview for RBC-Ukraine. ""Army funding is top priority. Training, rehabilitation, etc. A powerful independent army on the territory of Eastern Europe, on the territory of Ukraine, which protects not only Ukraine because it restrains any further encroachments. But today all this is the expenditure of the budget of Ukraine. Except for some of the weapons our partners supply. But I say again: they help themselves. And we are grateful to them. Without their help, the situation would be clearly worse,"" the Head of State said. The President stressed that Ukraine does not live ""in the illusion that everyone will be willing to die for it,"" and if the aggression begins, it will be ready to defend itself. ""We definitely do not want this. We emphasize: we do not need military people with foreign flags on our territory. We do not ask for this. Otherwise there will be destabilization all over the world. We do not want to give an extra reason for the Russian Federation to say that we have bases here and that they need to ""protect"" themselves. But we want everything else,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said."

Volodymyr Zelenskyy had an urgent phone conversation with the President of the European Council,2022-02-17T14:49:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy had an urgent phone conversation with President of the European Council Charles Michel. Volodymyr Zelenskyy informed his interlocutor about the current security situation around our country, emphasizing that currently Ukraine sees no evidence of withdrawal of Russian troops from our borders. The Head of State paid special attention to the aggravation of the situation in the area of the Joint Forces Operation observed this morning. In particular, he reported a significant number of violations of the ceasefire by illegal armed groups. The President put emphasis upon the shelling of a kindergarten in Stanytsia Luhanska by illegal armed groups this morning and called it a big provocation. ""This situation has once again proven that the evacuation of OSCE representatives and diplomats from Ukraine is not appropriate. It is important that diplomats and the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission stay in Ukraine. Monitoring activities are extremely important. This is an additional deterrent,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. According to the President, today the OSCE does not have enough resources to objectively record all the ceasefire violations that are taking place, including the current morning escalation. The President of Ukraine and the President of the European Council mutually supported the position on the need to keep the missions in Ukraine and reaffirmed their commitment to political and diplomatic efforts aimed to unblock the peace process and restore stability. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also thanked Charles Michel for the initiative to hold a donors' conference in support of Ukraine. The conversation took place before the beginning of a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels chaired by the President of the European Council. In particular, Charles Michel will discuss with European leaders the information provided by the President of Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the President of the European Council for the constant dialogue and his efforts to consolidate the international support of our state. Charles Michel reaffirmed the EU's strong and unwavering support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as its Euro-Atlantic aspirations."

Ukraine is ready for any format of talks with Russia to establish peace - President,2022-02-17T12:06:00Z,"Ukraine is ready for any format of talks with Russia to establish peace, but despite public statements, the Russian side does not show willingness for a real conversation. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a conversation with media representatives in Mariupol, Donetsk region. ""As soon as Russia says publicly that it is ready to talk about de-escalation, ready to talk about bilateral relations, every time after that we request Russia to hold a meeting in this or that format. But, apart from the public position, in reality they are not willing to communicate with us, they do not want to,"" the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated that Ukraine is ready for talks. ""I am ready for any format,"" he said. The Head of State also said that Ukraine, as a responsible country, submitted official requests and tried to contact Russian President Vladimir Putin when the risks of escalation on Ukraine's borders increased due to the buildup of Russian troops. ""Ukraine is not left without an answer, but this answer does not lead to a meeting. Nobody approves the phone conversation either,” he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukraine is also interested in initiatives of other countries that offer assistance in organizing a meeting with the Russian side. ""We are interested. I did not refuse any of the countries that offered this to us. Moreover, we ourselves have offered this to certain countries. We were interested in various formats of talks with the Russian Federation,"" the President said."
"Ukraine is welcome to NATO, yet not by all members of the Alliance - Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022-02-17T11:57:00Z,"Ukraine has been moving towards NATO membership for a long time, but, as in many other issues of sovereign choice, our country is being opposed on the path to Euro-Atlantic integration. The Head of State said this during a conversation with media representatives in Mariupol, Donetsk region. ""NATO is one of the issues that puts pressure on Ukraine. The main issue is Ukraine's independence and its independent choice in all issues, and Ukraine has been fighting for its right to this for many years,"" the President stressed. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that Ukraine has chosen the course of NATO membership for its own security, and has been moving in this direction for a long time, but the distance to the Alliance for our country is not reduced. ""And this is not a philosophical question, there are specific reasons - opposition from Russia, which does not want Ukraine to be a member of NATO, and from some countries - members of the Alliance. And there are no secrets in this,"" he said. At the same time, Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that Russia is now using the NATO issue as an excuse for the deployment of their troops on Ukraine's borders, and some European countries ""are playing along in this"". ""But you shouldn't distort the facts. Our territories have been occupied, the army is on our borders,"" the Head of State stressed. The President noted that the geopolitical course of Ukraine is enshrined in our Constitution, and this is indeed the choice of the Ukrainian people. ""But it is not the choice of the Ukrainian people when we will be there, as it depends not only on us - 30 countries must unanimously agree on this decision,"" said the President, adding that the possibility of putting the NATO issue to a referendum is not being considered."
"The situation on Ukraine's borders is under control, but the withdrawal of Russian troops has not yet been observed - President",2022-02-16T20:52:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that the Ukrainian servicemen control the situation on the borders of our state, but at the moment it cannot be stated that the Russian Federation is fully withdrawing its troops. The Head of State said this during the Marathon of Unity ""#UArazom"" while being in Mariupol, Donetsk region. ""The situation on our borders, on the touch line with the temporarily occupied territories, on the borders with Russia and Belarus is controlled by our military. We do not see any changes yet. We see a large concentration of troops, it has not changed in recent weeks. We see these or those small rotations. I would not call these rotations today the withdrawal of troops by the Russian Federation. We can't state that,"" he said. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, it is too early to draw conclusions. According to the President, the Ukrainian state continues to be active in the political and diplomatic sphere. After all, it is through diplomatic channels that signals are coming about the possible risks of Russian groups' buildup at the borders and escalation. ""Diplomacy has worked very well in terms of strengthening the Ukrainian army. This is also an important result. After all, thanks to our people, we have such an army, but we shouldn’t forget about the equipment,"" the President said."

Address of the President of Ukraine on the unity of Ukrainian society,2022-02-14T20:53:00Z,"Great people of a great country! I am addressing you at this tense moment. Our state is facing serious external and internal challenges that require responsibility, confidence and concrete actions from me and each of us. We are being intimidated by the great war and the date of the military invasion is being set again. This is not the first time.  The war against us is being systematically waged on all fronts. On the military one, they increase the contingent around the border. On the diplomatic one, they are trying to deprive us of the right to determine our own foreign policy course. On the energy one, they limit the supply of gas, electricity and coal. On the information one, they seek to spread panic among citizens and investors through the media. But our state today is stronger than ever. This is not the first threat that the strong Ukrainian people have faced. Two years ago, we, like the rest of the world, looked confused in the eyes of the pandemic. However, we united and with clear systemic steps practically defeated it. In this difficult time, the strong Ukrainian people have shown their best qualities - unity and the will to win. Unlike the pandemic two years ago, today we clearly understand all the challenges we face and what to do about them. We are confident, but not self-confident. We understand all the risks. We are constantly monitoring the situation, working out different scenarios, preparing decent responses to all possible aggressive actions. We know exactly where the foreign army is near our borders, its numbers, its locations, its equipment and its plans. We have something to respond with. We have a great army. Our guys have unique combat experience and modern weapons. This is an army many times stronger than eight years ago. Along with the army, Ukrainian diplomacy is at the forefront of defending our interests. We have managed to gain diplomatic support from almost all leaders of the civilized world. Most of them have either already visited and supported Ukraine, or will do so in the near future. Today, everyone recognizes that the security of Europe and the entire continent depends on Ukraine and its army. We want peace and we want to resolve all issues exclusively through negotiations. Both Donbas and Crimea will return to Ukraine. Exclusively through diplomacy. We do not encroach on what's not ours, but we will not give up our land. We are confident in our Armed Forces, but our military must also feel our support, our cohesion and our unity. The foothold of our army is the confidence of their own people and a strong economy. We have formed sufficient reserves to repel attacks on the hryvnia exchange rate and our financial system. We will not ignore any industry that will need government support. As it happened the other day with airlines. And evidence of this is a stable hryvnia exchange rate and open skies. An important front of defense is the objective coverage of the situation by the domestic media. And now I want to address our Ukrainian journalists. Some of you sometimes have to perform the tasks of media owners. Most of them have already fled their own country. Work for Ukraine, not for those who fled. The fate of the country today depends on your honest position. And now I want to address not those who stayed with Ukraine and in Ukraine, but those who left it at the most crucial moment. Your strength is not in your money and planes, but in the civic position you can show. Return to your people and the country due to which you got your factories and wealth. Today, everyone passes a real test for a citizen of Ukraine. Pass it with dignity. Let everyone understand for whom Ukraine is really the Homeland, and for whom it is just a platform for money making. I address separately all representatives of the state: civil servants, people's deputies of all levels who have fled the country or plan to do so. The people of Ukraine have entrusted you not only to govern the state, but also to protect it. It is your direct duty in this situation to be with us, with the Ukrainian people. I urge you to return to your homeland within 24 hours and stand side by side with the Ukrainian army, diplomacy and people! We are told that February 16 will be the day of the attack. We will make it the Day of Unity. The relevant decree has already been signed. On this day, we will hoist national flags, put on blue and yellow ribbons and show the world our unity. We have one great European aspiration. We want freedom and are ready to fight for it. 14,000 defenders and civilians killed in this war are watching us from the sky. And we will not betray their memory. We all want to live happily, and happiness loves the strong ones. We have never known what it is to give up and we are not going to learn that. Today is not just Valentine's Day. It is the day of those in love with Ukraine. We believe in our own strength and continue to build our future together. Because we are united by love for Ukraine, united and unique. And love will win. Yes, now you may think it's darkness all around. But tomorrow the sun will rise again over our peaceful sky. Love Ukraine! We are calm! We are strong! We are together! Great people of a great country."

Thanks to the program of thermal modernization more than 1.5 million citizens will be able to pay less for heating next season - President,2022-02-11T16:51:00Z,"In Kharkiv, at a meeting of the presidium of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities chaired by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Energy Independence Program, which envisages ""green"" transformation of the economy and increasing energy efficiency, in particular through thermal modernization of residential buildings, was presented. The President noted that energy independence is the key to a strong state, so he initiated a program of thermal modernization, which aims to reduce the consumption of imported energy. ""This year, measures will be taken to launch this program in about 5,000 high-rise residential buildings in Ukraine,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. According to the President, as a result of the implementation of this program, more than 1.5 million citizens will be able to pay less for heating next season. ""We are talking about 700,000 families living in such apartment buildings. I think the effect will be large-scale - savings of almost 8 billion hryvnias for the heating season 2022-2023. These are released funds for social programs, salary increases, development projects, increase of guarantees for the most vulnerable categories of the population,"" the Head of State stressed. Thanks to this program, Ukraine will be able to reduce gas imports by 2.5% in the next heating season. ""This is especially important today, when the aggressor state uses energy as a weapon,"" First Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of Economy of Ukraine Yulia Svyryidenko noted. She also noted that thermal modernization will create about 170 thousand new jobs. In the context of energy sustainability, Yulia Svyrydenko also said that today there are 10.7 billion cubic meters of gas in underground gas storage facilities, and at the end of the heating season 7 billion cubic meters are expected to remain, so the need for imports will be insignificant. Coal reserves in TPP warehouses are almost 1 million tons. In addition, Ukraine will soon conduct a test for energy independence. ""For three days we will be disconnected from the energy system of Russia and Belarus. If we pass this test well, we will integrate our system with the European Union's energy system and join ENTSO-E,"" she said. Also, according to Yulia Svyrydenko, the government is now closely monitoring world oil prices, which are growing rapidly leading to higher prices for gasoline and diesel in Ukraine. ""We are developing a comprehensive plan to stabilize this situation,"" said the First Deputy Prime Minister. Yulia Svyrydenko also reported on the economic situation in the country. In particular, she noted that Ukraine has been living in a state of constant tension and conflict for eight years, so the national economy has adapted to this situation. According to her, last year Ukraine's dollar GDP amounted to more than $ 200 billion, which is the highest figure in the history of our country's independence and even exceeds the records of 2007 and 2008 - before the occupation of Crimea and Donbas. According to the First Deputy Prime Minister, due to GDP growth, the government raised the minimum wage to UAH 6,500, while the average wage increased by 21% to UAH 14,000, and this growth significantly exceeded inflation. Also, she stressed, due to high revenues, the state budget deficit fell to 3.5% of GDP last year, and public debt is now below 50% of GDP. The international reserves of the National Bank of Ukraine at the end of 2021 were the highest in nine years - $ 31 billion, covering four months of imports. Such reserves allowed the NBU to stabilize the exchange rate when information tensions around Ukraine began to rise in early January. As there were no economic reasons for the growth of the exchange rate, in a short time it fell below 28 hryvnias per dollar. ""We can say that the panic is over,"" Yulia Svyrydenko said. Ukraine has also started the current fiscal year successfully: UAH 20 billion more in taxes and duties was received in January 2022 than in January 2021. Therefore, as Yulia Svyrydenko noted, Ukraine has financial strength."

First of all, he informed the audience about the security situation inside the country and near its borders, as this issue worries representatives of both domestic and foreign business. According to the Head of State, at the moment there are no obstacles in terms of security that would hinder the work of the business. ""We believe that the buildup of troops near the borders is a psychological pressure from our neighbors. We do not see anything new in this. As for whether there are risks, the risks have existed since 2014. What matters is the degree of these risks and how we react to them,"" the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed: Ukraine is doing everything possible to strengthen its defense capabilities and be able to respond to any developments.

""We dreamed of a state that provides citizens with quality service. For me, first of all, it's fast and convenient. When young parents receive 10 services in 15 minutes with just one application in the maternity hospital thanks to ""yeMalyatko"". It has been functioning only for two years. But today, nine out of ten Ukrainian families register the birth of a child through this service,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.

So far, the issues are related to the capabilities of the application and the services available in it, but in the future they will relate to other issues of the state. In the presentation video, Volodymyr Zelenskyy reminded that direct democracy is one of the key points of his presidential program. “Today we are taking the first step in this direction - Diia launches the ""Poll"" service, the first large-scale tool of e-democracy.

In particular, they concern the new digital services that have now appeared in the Diia app - which is the most useful, and which should be the name of the new government program for people over the age of 60. ""Choose your version, see how e-democracy works in ""Diia"", influence the development of the digital state,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged citizens. The President noted that the digital transformation not only saves time, but also changes public administration. Proof of this is the launch of the ""eSupport"" program. ""In two weeks it has become the most popular service in the history of Ukraine. One thousand hryvnias for vaccinated citizens plus 500 hryvnias for a booster dose. Funds that can be spent on sports, concerts, movies, theaters, museums, books, traveling in Ukraine. Eight million Ukrainians used it. The affected business sectors received 2.3 billion hryvnias. And the whole world understood that Ukrainians are a nation that reads, because every third citizen spent these funds on books. And this is wonderful,"" the President said. The President reminded that in February 2020, when the presentation of the newly created Diia app took place, digital driver's licenses and technical passports were available, and then it was considered a breakthrough. And today there are more than 20 documents and services in the application, and more than 50 government services, licenses and permits on the Diia portal. ""We have become the fourth country in Europe to have electronic driver's licenses. Then it was pride. We were the first in the world to launch a digital passport that is as valid as a paper one. Then it was fantastic. We were the first to join the single digital market in Europe with COVID-certificates generated by 10 million Ukrainians. And now it's all a habit. The habit of high-quality, fast and convenient service from the state,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. As the President noted, the more difficult it is to surprise citizens every time, the more ambitious the plans and the way forward are. ""But I am sure that at the next Diia Summit, as always, we will have something to tell, something to be proud of, there will be victories that we will be able to surprise you with, and ambitious plans that will surprise you and the whole world even more. But this does not frighten us. Because we know for sure: what was called a ""dream"" yesterday is called ""Diia"" today. The main thing is to dream and act,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy summed up. The Head of State urged: do not be afraid to dream, because digitization in Ukraine is just that."

In particular, according to him, in the struggle for life and health, unity was demonstrated by 15 million Ukrainian citizens who received two vaccinations. As a result, the course of the disease is milder, fewer people are hospitalized and fewer people die. ""The unity of power yesterday during the adoption of the budget is twice the salary for doctors. The unity of power today is the normal passage of new waves (of coronavirus incidence - ed.), sufficient supply of beds, oxygen, billions of hryvnias of ""eSupport"" and millions of citizens who have used it,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy and thanked parliamentarians for supporting this program. The Head of State stressed that today unity is needed both in deeds and in public statements - in the information field, in the ""understanding of the media of its responsibility."" ""At a time when the media field is a new battlefield, news is a new weapon, and any messages, especially those based on anonymous sources, have a real and great impact on the mental health of our people, on our state, and especially the economy,"" said the President. In this context, Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked citizens and business representatives who were united and did not give in to the ""panic virus"". ""Our economy is stabilizing, everything is under control in the financial system, budget revenues in January were overachieved by 7 billion.

""Their quotations return to their previous level, so the financial world is optimistic about the future in Ukraine,"" he said. Also, according to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the country has sufficient reserves of gas and coal. For the first time in 30 years, all nuclear power units are operating, so our country is using the full potential of nuclear energy. Ukraine's gold and foreign exchange reserves remain at a record level, which protects the national currency from sharp fluctuations and strengthens economic immunity, the President said. In addition, there are signals of readiness to provide financial support to Ukraine from international partners. ""For them, I thank the European Union, I thank the leaders of European countries, the United States, Canada and all those who will soon be ready to announce such decisions,"" said the President."

The government will come up with appropriate proposals in the coming days,"" Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said at a briefing following the meeting. According to the head of government, in regard to the global energy crisis, Ukrainian producers are considering raising prices for their products, so the key task for the government is not only to help producers, but also to protect Ukrainian consumers.

""I want to emphasize: we clearly feel how the situation in the energy markets affects each sector of the economy, but we will not stand aside. We will find a solution that will help preserve all clusters of the economy and gas production in Ukraine,"" Shurma said."
President at meeting in SBU: Security of Ukraine is major priority of the state now,2021-12-24T14:25:00Z,"Ensuring security in Ukraine in its broadest sense is the major priority of the state today, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at the wrap-up meeting of the board of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) held in Kyiv. ""Ukraine's security has a broad sense. These are protected borders, protected critical infrastructure, protected economic and energy independence,"" the President said, delivering his speech. According to the President, citizens and the state must be protected from terrorist attacks and be free from enemy propaganda. ""This is the most pressing request of each of us, our society. This and much more is under my personal control thanks to you, the key people who are fighting for our independence every day. This is a key task for each of us,"" Zelenskyy said. Reviewing the achievement of the year, the President said that the Security Service of Ukraine has finally ceased to be a nightmare for business, and this was noted by a representative of the Business Ombudsman Council, and ""became a nightmare for traitors, separatists, smugglers"" and other thieves who were sanctioned under the decisions of the National Security and Defense Council. ""In this regard, I would like to thank you for the important information and proposals for the National Security and Defense Council meetings. We have done many important things to protect our security, which should have been done in 2014,"" Zelenskyy said. According to the Head of State, changes in the activities of the SBU are noticed not only by Ukrainian society, but also by international partners. ""This transformation is the logical beginning of change. Despite optimizing the structure and reducing some functions of the SBU, it is important for us that the best personnel remain in the ranks of the SBU,"" the President said, adding that there will be a lot of work in the sphere of security in 2022. Zelenskyy called the protection of national interests and statehood, resisting Russian aggression and hybrid war, protection of critical infrastructure, and counterintelligence among the most important tasks for next year. The second important area, according to Zelenskyy, is the fight against terrorism in all its manifestations. The third area is cybersecurity, in particular the protection of information resources of the state and blocking the impact of propaganda. ""These are strong destabilizing factors that will be used both from outside and, unfortunately, inside our country. I count on your successful counteraction to them in both directions,"" the President said. At the same time, he expressed his conviction that officers of the Security Service of Ukraine have enough experience, skills and abilities to successfully perform all tasks. ""After all, you understand perfectly well what the interests of the state are and why they should be protected under any circumstances,"" Zelenskyy said, addressing the SBU staff, and thanked them for their service. The President also presented SBU officers with state awards and certificates for receiving apartments. For his part, Head of the Security Service of Ukraine Ivan Bakanov said that in 2021 the SBU, in cooperation with representatives of other law enforcement agencies, successfully dealt with key threats to national security. In particular, these are large-scale military exercises at the border, elections to the Russian authorities in the occupied territories of Ukraine, the migration crisis on the border between Belarus and the EU, cyber attacks on the authorities and special information campaigns against our country. ""It was a year of systemic protection of the state's interests. The SBU has become an effective tool in the work of the National Security and Defense Council. We coordinated and effectively countered the hybrid war, destabilization, and worked to preserve the country's economic potential,"" Bakanov said. At the same time, the head of the Security Service of Ukraine said that the hybrid war is becoming more intense and taking on new forms, as the Russian intelligence agencies have strengthened the units working against Ukraine technically and with personnel. Thus, their sabotage and recruitment activity will increase. ""The role of the Security Service in preserving Ukrainian statehood is growing. State security and internal stability in the country depend on a modern and competent intelligence agency,"" Bakanov said.  "
"Zelenskyy: Over 40% of Ukraine's main road network renovated, built within two years under Large Construction Program",2021-12-24T12:57:00Z,"Thanks to the Large Construction national program more than 14,000 km of roads in Ukraine has been upgraded and built in two years. Next year, the program will be expanded with projects to modernize border crossing points. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during the Large Construction: Roads and Bridges national forum. As the Head of State said, despite the fact that the Constitution of Ukraine guarantees freedom of movement, this right in our country has been limited for years by broken roads and destroyed bridges. ""I agree, a few years ago a forum called Roads and Bridges was something like a forum about aliens or time travel. In short, this was a discussion about what everyone heard, but almost no one saw. The transformation of roads and bridges from mythical concepts into real modern objects was started two years ago by our team and the Large Construction program,"" Zelenskyy said. According to the President, despite the skepticism of some people, with which they met the Large Construction program (saying that there will not be enough people, funding and building materials), in 2020, more than 6,500 km of roads was renovated or built, and this year it was more than 7,000 km of different roads. Zelenskyy said that the government stopped thinking in terms of one budget year, changed its approach to public investment, procurement and pricing, united various teams and bodies around long-term goals, managed to attract public and international funds, improve quality and even reduce the cost of construction of one km of roads. And the result is almost 14,000 km of roads in two years under the Large Construction program. More than 40% of the main road network of Ukraine, which connects large and small cities and towns, all important Ukrainian regions, has been renovated and built. This is what we see today according to statistics,"" Zelenskyy said. The President said that the results of opinion polls confirm the highest assessment of the government's work: every third citizen considers road construction one of the most important achievements of Ukraine in 2021, and positive changes in infrastructure are noted by more than 60%. ""Only one conclusion we can draw: Large Construction program must continue and become even greater. In particular, this concerns the development of border infrastructure. Much has already been done here, and in 2022 the modernization of border crossing points will begin under the program. We will create a comfortable infrastructure for both people and businesses, for our citizens and guests of Ukraine. We will boost the capacity through the electronic queue. That is modern infrastructure,"" the Head of State said. Zelenskyy also said that an experiment to find a contractor and finance a project to build the Kyiv Orbital road is underway, and there are hopes to attract powerful international players. ""On the path to building modern infrastructure, we currently have the support of our partners – the European Union, the World Bank, the EBRD and others. And this is proof of recognition of the effectiveness of our work, the work of the infrastructure team of our state and our reliability. It is really recognition of the quality of road networks and infrastructure projects that have already been built and implemented over the past two years,"" the President said. According to Zelenskyy, in times of global crisis, infrastructure development is the best joint investment of all citizens. ""This is because roads and bridges, schools and kindergartens, sports complexes, stadiums and all other objects of Large Construction program are being renovated at the expense of our taxpayers. I want to thank all the citizens of Ukraine who dutifully and honestly pay taxes. Large Construction is not only a program of the government, but first of all it is the program of our state, our joint program, the program of our citizens. We are building together and we will build Ukraine together,"" the President said. Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal said that the biggest-ever number of roads has been restored in two years – almost 14,000 km, which is a record for independent Ukraine. And the implementation of this program will be continued next year. The Prime Minister also said that under the Large Construction program Ukravtodor restored more than 350 civil engineering structures. In total, more than 600 bridges have been rebuilt together with local authorities. ""And this will also continue, because we have a large number of bridges that need to be reconstructed, renovated and built,"" Shmyhal said. According to the head of government, in 2022 more than UAH 140 billion was budgeted for further construction and repair of roads. Among other things, the possibility of attracting not only funds from international institutions, but also business is being considered. In particular, the implementation of the first concession highway Krakivets - Brody - Lviv - Rivne should start next year, which will also give an additional impetus to the development of infrastructure, and thus the development of the tourist and transit potential of Ukraine. According to Shmyhal, the Small Carpathian Circle project, which includes 640 km of roads, is important for the development of tourism in Ukraine. This project is designed to fully unleash the potential of the Ukrainian Carpathians as a tourist area. Minister of Infrastructure of Ukraine Oleksandr Kubrakov, for his part, added that in 2021, UAH 106 billion was provided for roads of state importance, that is the funding has increased fivefold in two years. At the same time, the cost of road works decreased from UAH 25 million in 2019 to UAH 20.7 million in 2021 due to competition and mandatory examination of all projects. In two years, the Large Construction program created more than 200,000 jobs, which was very important during the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. In general, according to experts, Large Construction program gives from 1.5% to 4% of Ukraine's GDP growth annually. Kubrakov also spoke about the implementation of major infrastructure projects, including Zaporizhzhia Bridge, which is scheduled to open in January. The M-30 Stryi-Izvaryne route of international importance appeared in April 2021 after the merger of the M-04 and M-12 roads, which is the longest highway in Ukraine, is almost competed. The R-08 Nemyriv - Yampil road is fully completed, and the next stage is a joint project with the Moldovan side – Yampil Bridge across the Dniester River."
Trilateral Contact Group Meeting takes place,2021-12-22T21:33:00Z,"A meeting of the Trilateral Contact Group (TCG) took place today, which could give restrained optimism about the possible de-escalation of the situation in Donbas and the unblocking of the peace process. The meeting reached a common understanding on the need to restore the ceasefire within the relevant steps agreed on July 22, 2020, as evidenced, inter alia, by OSCE representatives. ""For the first time in a long time, there is a real opportunity to ensure ceasefire on the contact line in Donetsk and Luhansk regions,"" Acting First Deputy Head of the Ukrainian Delegation to the TCG Andriy Kostin said. - The Ukrainian side is completely ready for this. It is important that we see the readiness of the other side to take this step."" This result is especially important in view of the upcoming winter holidays. It is traditional for our citizens to celebrate Christmas and New Year in peace and with the closest people. The security component is perceived as decisive. The ability to guarantee the full implementation of the relevant promises and to implement the measures to strengthen the ceasefire agreed on July 22, 2020 will also mean the possibility of peace and implementation of other necessary points. The Ukrainian side also continues working in all available formats for the release of detainees, the opening of the checkpoints, and the implementation of other agreements in the interests of all Ukrainians on both sides of the contact line."
Ukraine values its diplomats and counts on them – Zelenskyy,2021-12-22T21:28:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy and First Lady Olena Zelenska took part in the celebrations on the occasion of the Day of the Diplomatic Service of Ukraine, which took place in the village of Huta, Ivano-Frankivsk region. Addressing diplomats, the Head of State said that the events held within the framework of the conference of ambassadors of Ukraine ""Diplomacy 30. Strategy of Strong State"" were substantive with warm atmosphere, as well as sincere and informal communication. ""I want to say that, regardless of the place in the world where you work, your rank, all Ukrainian ambassadors are extraordinary for our country and for me personally. You work far beyond Ukraine, but Ukraine is always there. Ukraine sees you, Ukraine appreciates you, Ukraine is counting on you!"" Zelenskyy said. The President presented state awards to diplomats on the occasion of their professional holiday for their significant personal contribution to strengthening Ukraine's international cooperation, long-term fruitful diplomatic activity and high professionalism. The Ukrainian diplomats also received congratulations from Head of the Office of the President Andriy Yermak, Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Ruslan Stefanchuk, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, and Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba. In particular, Stefanchuk said that diplomats are compared with soldiers who are at the forefront of international relations and restrain diplomatic pressure. ""But it seems to me that the most Ukrainian comparison for you is with birds that fly from Ukraine and know exactly where their native land is,"" Stefanchuk said. For his part, Shmyhal thanked the ambassadors for their work and said that the state appreciates the work of each of them and the staff of their diplomatic missions. Kuleba added that the President of Ukraine, who represents the country in the international arena, can rely on the team of Ukrainian diplomats."
Ukraine manages to avoid sharp rise in tariffs for housing and utility services – Shurma,2021-12-22T11:12:00Z,"The Ukrainian government has taken a number of systemic measures to avoid a sharp rise in tariffs for housing and utility services amid rising energy prices in the world. This was stated by Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Rostyslav Shurma. The deputy head of the Office of the President said in his blog for the Korrespondent publication that this winter there was an anomaly in the global and regional energy markets, which led to a galloping rise in prices for natural gas, electricity and coal. This was due to the rapid recovery of the global economy from the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the increase in consumption, to which supply chains were unprepared. Russia has also played a role in energy price hikes, and its actions in the regional gas market have led to record prices. The price of gas per 1,000 cubic meters has increased 20 times compared to 2020. Amid these processes, energy tariffs for household consumers across Europe have skyrocketed. ""The Ukrainian government clearly understands how sensitive this issue is for every citizen of Ukraine, so we have taken a number of systemic measures to curb rising energy prices and tariffs for housing and utility services,"" Shurma said. According to him, some adjustments of some tariffs are possible within the inflation expectations of 10-11%, including tariffs for gas distribution and delivery, but the price of gas for households will not increase during the current heating season. ""The government has provided large funds to keep gas tariffs for households at last year's level – below UAH 8 per cubic meter. The government has also allocated funds to provide preferential gas to municipal heating companies, so that households can receive heating at almost last year's prices,"" the deputy head of the Office of the President said. According to Shurma, the government also managed to keep electricity prices for the population from rising this year and even cut them for some categories of consumers. He said that the increase in tariffs for the supply or distribution of electricity for regional power companies will not in any way affect the cost of electricity for households. In conclusion, the deputy head of the Office of the Head of State said that populist politicians and the opposition often like to use the issue of tariffs for baseless criticism of the government, so he called on Ukrainian citizens to pay attention to facts rather than political speculation. ""When there is nothing to come up with, they shake up the topic of tariffs for households. We have been able to implement a comprehensive program to prevent sharp growth, as has happened in other countries, but irresponsible populist politicians are still trying to speculate on this topic, although the facts speak for themselves,"" Shurma said."
"Ukraine offers steps to foster peace settlement in Donbas, ready for talks in various formats – Zelenskyy",2021-12-21T20:00:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterates that Ukraine is constantly initiating steps to advance in the process of ending the war and reaching a peaceful settlement in Donbas and is ready to negotiate in any format with the participation of the Russian Federation. The Head of State stated this, speaking with media representatives at the conference of Ukrainian ambassadors ""Diplomacy 30. Strategy of Strong State"" in Huta, Ivano-Frankivsk region. The President said that negotiations within the Trilateral Contact Group were under way these days. ""I don't know about Russia, but we definitely expect three of our initiatives to be taken into account – clear issues that I think everyone is ready for: a ceasefire (there are some details on verifying the ceasefire)… The opening of checkpoints is the second issue. I do not see what the problem is. Only the desire of one side is needed. And the swap also requires desire,"" Zelenskyy said. According to the Head of State, if the other side has the appropriate desire, it is quite possible to reach agreements on the implementation of these issues before the New Year and Christmas holidays. ""We are constantly preparing and initiating different documents, different steps, so that we are not accused of not wanting something. We don't just talk. We say we are ready to fulfill it,"" the President said. Zelenskyy also reiterated that he is ready for direct talks with the President of the Russian Federation in any format. According to him, Ukraine has even proposed ten steps that can be taken with the involvement of member states of the Normandy format and the United States. ""We have passed these steps on to President Biden, the Russian side, France and Germany,"" the President said. ""We are ready for a direct dialogue. We do not care in what format. We need readiness,"" Zelenskyy said. According to the President, work on possible negotiations in various formats is underway. ""There is the Normandy format. There is a conversation between the President of the United States and the President of Russia. There are talks between security advisers of these states. And we have different conversations. There is a multi-vector conversation,"" the Head of State said. Regarding Ukraine's membership in NATO, Zelenskyy said that he had discussed a possibility of our country's participation in the NATO summit in Madrid in 2022 with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and some leaders of the NATO countries. ""The most important event for us is to be present there in one role or another, and to have a concrete membership perspective in 2022 with clearly defined dates – during which time we are seen as an equal member of the Alliance,"" the President said."
Olena Zelenska takes part in annual conference of ambassadors of Ukraine,2021-12-21T19:21:00Z,"First Lady Olena Zelenska took part in the conference of ambassadors of Ukraine ""Diplomacy 30. Strategy of Strong State,"" which was held in the village of Huta, Ivano-Frankivsk region. In her welcoming speech, the President's wife said that the diplomatic corps is a powerful tool for Ukraine's ties with the world. And this year there were many bright events in Ukrainian diplomacy. ""And I am proud to have initiated one of them – the Kyiv Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen. In August, we received the wives and husbands of leaders from around the world in Kyiv. And they wrote a new, Ukrainian page in the history of soft power diplomacy, because this was the first such event in the world. Our task for next year is to bring the summit of the first ladies and gentlemen to the leading international platforms, to attract as many participants and world-class experts as possible. And here the skill and initiative of our diplomats will be needed,"" Zelenska said. She also met separately with the spouses of Ukrainian ambassadors, who visited the event for the first time this year. The President's wife stressed the importance of family tandems in diplomatic work. ""There was a phrase in my husband's inaugural speech that was remembered: 'Each of us is the President.' I want to use it in a new way. And tell you all: ""Each of us is the First Lady."" You represent our country abroad, build its image. I personally know many of you and I am grateful for the help I receive from you during my visits,"" she said. Zelenska told the audience about the priority projects implemented under her auspices – the reform of school nutrition, the introduction of a barrier-free environment for all, the fight against domestic violence – and invited representatives of the diplomatic corps to cooperate in these issues. She also thanked them for their partnership in the project to create Ukrainian audio guides for the world's leading museums. At the conference, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba summed up the diplomatic results of 2021. ""Today, the First Lady is implementing a set of important initiatives that are changing our society for the better. This is barrier-free environment, popularizing reading, important cultural initiatives. Abroad, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is implementing a large-scale initiative of Olena Zelenska to promote the positive image of Ukraine and popularize the Ukrainian language – the launch of Ukrainian-language audio guides in museums and attractions around the world. This is a very successful cooperation for the benefit of Ukraine,"" the minister said."
Yermak tells Ukrainian ambassadors about state of negotiations on peaceful settlement in Donbas,2021-12-21T18:24:00Z,"Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak addressed the heads of foreign diplomatic missions of Ukraine at the conference of ambassadors ""Diplomacy 30. Strategy of Strong State,"" taking place in Huta, Ivano-Frankivsk region. He briefed the Ukrainian ambassadors on the progress of negotiations within the Minsk process and the Normandy format on ending the war and resolving the situation in Donbas. Yermak said that these negotiations have been quite difficult lately, but Ukraine is trying different ways to move this process forward. In particular, the Ukrainian side presented a number of key initiatives within the TCG: return to the ceasefire, swap of detainees and the opening of checkpoints. Complex initiatives were also prepared and handed over to the partners – 10 steps, the implementation of which will be able to unlock the peace process. The head of the Office of the President said that the leadership of the United States has decided to join the settlement process in eastern Ukraine. ""At the same time, this does not threaten the existence of the Normandy format. This is a parallel track. We discussed similar issues with the United Kingdom today. Turkey is ready to play the same role,"" he said. President of France Emmanuel Macron and the leadership of the European Union, in particular President of the European Council Charles Michel, are now taking a very active position on this issue. ""We are in a very strong position today. And when Russia has made some proposals for security in Europe, we are telling everyone: what can security be like in Europe without ending the war in central Europe?"" he said. Yermak also stressed the importance of viable communication on Ukraine's aspirations to become a member of NATO. According to him, it is very important to provide information on complex and extremely important historical reforms in Ukraine. ""For example, today is the first time we are fighting the oligarchs as a phenomenon. And the law on de-oligarchization does not target any particular person. Its goal is to make it impossible for some rich people in Ukraine to ""buy"" ministers, deputies, and influence state decisions,"" the head of the President's Office said."
"Ukraine's foreign policy today needs four things: speed, creativity, ambition and efficiency – Zelenskyy",2021-12-21T13:29:00Z,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed the need to change the style and philosophy of Ukraine's foreign policy – it must be fast, creative, ambitious and effective. This was stated by the Head of State, speaking at the conference of ambassadors of Ukraine ""Diplomacy 30. Strategy of Strong State,"" which is taking place in Huta, Ivano-Frankivsk region. The President said that the current conference is an important element of the new format of Ukrainian diplomacy, within which such meetings will be held annually. As Zelenskyy said, today, the world lives in a new situation, where global changes take place almost every day. ""In these circumstances, we must change the style and philosophy of our foreign policy. Today, it needs many things. I would like to dwell on four main, in my opinion, priorities,"" the Head of State said. ""The first is speed. From too conservative, and therefore very slow, our diplomacy must become lively and dynamic, that is, fast. Currently, Ukraine is forced to catch up in many processes. And this is wrong,"" the President said. According to Zelenskyy, Ukraine must move fast, and therefore should not waste time on minor things. ""We want to unblock the Donbas peace process as soon as possible, return Crimea, achieve EU membership in the coming years and get a very clear term perspective from NATO, very concrete term. And we want to get it in 2022,"" the President of Ukraine said. To achieve all these goals, according to the Head of State, we need the second thing – creativity. After all, the desire for a quick result forces Ukraine to look for all possible ways to achieve it. ""We should not wait for someone to solve our problems instead of us, but look for and offer new mechanisms and new formats every day. Each of you must go beyond the conventional politics. Think about how else we can help our country, Ukraine, other than the usual daily calls to keep sanctions or join NATO. I am very much looking forward to such formats, I am very much looking forward to your new ideas,"" Zelenskyy said. In order for these ideas to be interesting and have the support of Ukraine's international partners, we need a third thing – ambition, the President said. ""Ambitious thoughts, ambitious formats, ambitious ideas. This is the face of our state. Get rid of negative, constantly depressed, pessimistic thinking. Get rid of such words: it is impossible, it will not be, and it is not for us, and it is, God forbid, of our level. Get rid of the feeling of being embarrassed like third world countries. We have a thousand-year history of statehood. We have had mechanisms of democracy and people's authority in place long before it appeared in many European countries. We have a huge potential. Europe needs Ukraine, rather than the reverse. This is ambition,"" the Head of State said. According to the President, a change in Ukraine's own perception will change the perception of our country around the world. According to him, Ukraine should declare itself as a strong strategic partner and a source of opportunities, not problems and threats. It is necessary to continue the formation of Ukraine as a regional leader, through small alliances and initiatives it is necessary to build a new reality, where Ukraine is a driver and leader of processes. ""Not a poor relative who always asks someone for something, but a strong, self-sufficient country that relies primarily on itself. And it is great if other countries rely on Ukraine. This is ambitious,"" Zelenskyy said. All these factors, according to the President, will provide the fourth, most important element – the result, which is measured not by the number of applications, but by specific amounts of support, projects, and investments. ""Specificity. Less politics, more economy. After all, it is the economy and the common economic interest of certain states that strengthen the political partnership between countries. There should be more and more Ukrainian products abroad every day. We need to expand free trade area agreements with the EU, Canada and Israel. I strongly believe that we are finalizing the FTA with Turkey. I would like to do it early next year, when President Erdogan will visit Ukraine. Also we should move towards trade liberalization with the United States, Japan and other promising trading partners. We need to move away from the stereotyped vision, and constantly look for new opportunities and for new markets. It is ambitious, and it is about the result,"" the President said. According to him, Ukraine should also make more use of the potential of India, China, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. ""In fact, we have to rediscover these regions for Ukraine and for our business, for our goods, for Ukrainians. We are stepping up our diplomatic presence and will soon open new embassies in many countries. I think this is a great result,"" Zelenskyy said. The President said that Ukrainian diplomats should transform their work in the host countries into concrete economic and social achievements, because sometimes economic dividends go hand in hand with the economy. ""I am ready to personally visit key capitals, hold talks with leaders where we open embassies, where there are concrete proposals, where there are certain joint businesses, economic projects for our state. I know that a personal visit is really a requirement of some regions. This is how leaders in other countries used to live. And well, it is good, we are open, we are ready. There are no problems with this,"" he said, adding that such visits from the point of view of economy and trade are needed first of all. The head of state called on Ukrainian diplomats to look for specific topics where Ukraine could be interesting for the leaders of other states, and what would be interesting for our country: joint initiatives and agreements. ""In short, the result with which my delegation and I should return to Ukraine from each foreign visit measures your effectiveness as ambassador,"" Zelenskyy said. Speaking at the conference, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba said that as part of one of the main tasks set by the President of Ukraine to promote Ukrainian business abroad, a new project was developed – the Nazovni IT platform. It will open the world of new opportunities for domestic business, using the potential of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and all 130 diplomatic missions. Thanks to this platform, exporters will have the unified convenient channel of communication with the state to expand their business abroad to foreign markets. Under the new system, exporters will be able to create a request for specific support in entering a foreign market and monitor the status of its implementation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and diplomats will receive this application and will be actively involved immediately after its verification according to certain criteria. ""Now it is the main tool for promoting Ukrainian exports abroad through Ukrainian embassies,"" Kuleba said."
"To prevent possible escalation by Russia, strong preventive sanctions needed, not post-factum response – President of Ukraine",2021-12-20T16:17:00Z,"To prevent a possible escalation by the Russian Federation and the deteriorating security situation in Europe, the international community must take strong preventive steps, rather than reacting to events that have already taken place, as it was with the migration crisis on Poland and Lithuania's borders with Belarus. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was speaking with the media after a trilateral meeting with the presidents of Poland and Lithuania at the Syniohora state residence in the village of Huta in Ivano-Frankivsk region. ""What are ""sanctions after""? I believe that there should be strong preventive steps, serious sanctions, so that there is not even a thought of escalation in any region, because we see that this already touches not only to Ukraine, but also any state of the European Union,"" Zelenskyy said. The President said that Ukraine, which is not yet a member of NATO and the EU, is now actively developing friendly relations with its neighbors, in particular, to strengthen security in the region. Zelenskyy reminded that our state immediately helped Moldova during the energy crisis and Lithuania during the migration crisis. ""That is why today, we are meeting with our friends from Lithuania and Poland, because they understand that we also need their support today,"" the Head of State said. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda also believes that sanctions should be convincing. ""We are imposing sanctions to change their behavior. They should understand: if something happens, there will be an immediate and very serious response,"" he said. According to the Lithuanian leader, it is important that the actions of EU countries are supported by countries such as the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. For his part, Polish President Andrzej Duda said that historical records have shown that no ultimatums of certain countries, including Russia, can be accepted. He is convinced that one of the main factors that the new escalation by Russia is not becoming a reality is that after Russia's aggression against Ukraine in 2014, NATO militarily strengthened its eastern flank. ""I think the biggest mistake is to agree to blackmail. We have to take a strong position. And this is exactly how NATO should behave, be consistent,"" the President of Poland said."
"Ukraine, Lithuania, Poland have common approaches to key challenges in region, as evidenced by signing of joint statement – Zelenskyy",2021-12-20T16:01:00Z,"The first personal meeting of the heads of state of the Lublin Triangle testified to the unity of positions and approaches of Ukraine, Lithuania and Poland to the most pressing issues and key challenges in the region. Proof of this was the signing of a joint statement by the leaders of the three states, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said. Speaking with the media following the trilateral meeting with President of the Republic of Lithuania Gitanas Nausėda and President of the Republic of Poland Andrzej Duda at the Syniohora state residence in the village of Huta, Ivano-Frankivsk region, Zelenskyy thanked his colleagues for accepting the invitation to visit Huta. ""This is our first personal meeting in the format of the Lublin Triangle. It testified to the unity of our positions, assessments, the unity of our approaches both to the most pressing issues for our countries and to the key challenges in our region. A joint statement signed following today's summit was a proof of such unity,"" the President of Ukraine said. According to him, one of the most important topics of the talks was the ongoing migration crisis on the borders of the European Union and Belarus. ""Assessing it, we stand in solidarity with our Polish and Lithuanian partners. Due to the failure of any attempts to repeat the same scenario in Ukraine, we are actively strengthening our own border. At the same time, coordination of joint efforts and exchange of experience are important in this matter,"" the Head of State said. Zelenskyy said that another element of this hybrid war is the escalation of the situation in the temporarily occupied territory and on the borders of Ukraine. ""I spoke in detail about our peace initiatives within the Trilateral Contact Group, the Minsk meeting, our readiness for dialogue and our efforts to organize a meeting of the Normandy Four countries. In difficult security conditions, solidarity and support are extremely important to us. I appreciate such support and assistance from Poland and Lithuania,"" the President of Ukraine said. Touching the issue of security, the President of Ukraine said that today, there is an active cooperation between law enforcement agencies of the three countries. The trilateral military brigade – LITPOLUKRBRIG – is a vivid example of an effective regional format where Ukrainian troops develop skills according to NATO standards. Trilateral cooperation is also being established to combat misinformation. ""It is important that the joint statement records clear support for Ukraine's membership in the EU and NATO, the fight against Russian aggression. Today, we have coordinated steps to support our European and Euro-Atlantic integration for the next year, 2022,"" Zelenskyy said. According to the President of Ukraine, the common task is to deter the threat from Russia and protect Europe from its aggressive policy. ""Today, Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania are at the forefront of this deterrence. We understand more than anyone else how urgent the need is to consolidate our joint efforts, how much unity is needed today. Ukraine, together with friends and partners, is actively working to unite the world community and allies around the ideas of security, peace and stability in Europe and around the world,"" Zelenskyy said, adding: ""Together we are stronger."" Duda, for his part, confirmed that one of the main challenges for the three countries today is the migration crisis and the buildup of Russian troops near the borders of Ukraine and Poland. ""Our position as the presidents of the Lublin Triangle on this matter is very clear: Ukraine's security is a fundamental issue. We must not only stop a military attack on Ukraine, but we must do everything to prevent such an attack,"" the Polish president said. According to Duda, the joint statement of the presidents clearly indicates the directions of future cooperation between the three countries. ""We express solidarity. We discussed these important topics. We say that we have a common history and common security,"" the Polish leader said. Nausėda said that Lithuania consistently supports the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within internationally recognized borders. He expressed support for Ukraine in the fight against aggression and provision of assistance in the path to NATO membership. ""We see that by its actions Russia is trying to put pressure on Ukraine… No one has the right to veto and influence the decisions and choices of an independent state. We have a very simple and clear signal – the consequences will be very severe for Russia. And all attempts to draw a new ""red line"" will be unacceptable in the XXI century in Europe,"" Nausėda said. The President of Lithuania also said that Nord Stream 2 is primarily a geopolitical project that continues to threaten Europe's energy security. ""I would like to express my gratitude once again to President Zelenskyy and President Duda for today's meeting and for the fact that there is a strategic partnership between our countries, that it has become stronger and more viable. Such trilateral meetings show the unity and determination of our countries in this region,"" the President of Lithuania said."

"President of Ukraine: We are starting geographical decentralization of diplomacy, meeting of Ukrainian ambassadors to take place in Huta every year",2021-12-20T15:34:00Z,"The conference with the participation of all ambassadors of Ukraine, which will take place on December 21-22 in Huta, Ivano-Frankivsk region, will begin a large-scale process of geographical decentralization of Ukrainian diplomacy. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was speaking with media representatives after a trilateral meeting with the Presidents of Poland and Lithuania at the Syniohora residence. The head of the Ukrainian state stressed his ambitious goal: to change the perception of Ukraine in the world – not as a geographical object, but as a political entity. ""Not a problematic, but a strategic partner, whose opinion and interest the world takes into account not only formally, but it really takes them into account. To this end, Ukraine must be a proactive player in the global arena, not a silent observer. This is possible when diplomacy is aware of its high role, and foreign policy changes from too conservative, and therefore slow, to modern, mobile and very dynamic,"" he said. Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian diplomacy should be created not only in the capital of the country – high-level meetings, summits, forums should be held throughout the country: in Lviv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Dnipro, Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities. ""We started this path not today and we have first successful steps, so to speak, pilot projects. But Huta 2021 is the start of a new large-scale process involving more than 300 people. This is the geographical decentralization of Ukrainian diplomacy,"" the President said. The President said that previously meetings with all serving ambassadors of Ukraine were held every two or three years, which in the modern world of rapid change made them ineffective and formal. ""We need content, we need results, so from now on I will gather Ukrainian ambassadors here in Huta every year,"" Zelenskyy said. The President reminded that for the first time since Ukraine's independence a comprehensive action plan of Ukraine on the world stage – the Strategy of Foreign Policy – has been approved. ""Moving towards the EU and NATO, strengthening our presence and national interest in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. We will analyze the implementation of these and other important issues in the next two days. And every next year, strengthening our diplomatic team, we will discuss together the results and new goals of the external strategy of our independent Ukraine,"" the President said."

Roman Mashovets discusses ways to improve security situation in eastern Ukraine and near it with German Foreign Minister,2021-12-17T21:25:00Z,"Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Roman Mashovets discussed the security situation in eastern and around Ukraine, ways to improve it and some issues of bilateral security cooperation with Minister of State at the Federal Foreign Office of Germany Tobias Lindner. During the meeting, Mashovets congratulated Lindner on his appointment as Minister of State at the Federal Foreign Office and his first foreign visit to Ukraine. The deputy head of the Office of the President briefed Lindner on the security situation in the eastern Ukraine and near the borders of Ukraine, the buildup of Russian troops along the Ukrainian border, and the strengthening of intelligence activity on the part of the Russian Federation. He noted the intensification of asymmetric and provocative actions by Russia not only against Ukraine but also against other countries, which undermines international security. Germany paid special attention to the steps made by the Russian Federation, which indicate its preparation for the expansion of aggression against our state. Mashovets suggested that Germany, as a leading European country, take steps to consolidate the EU, NATO and the entire Western community to prevent further aggressive actions by Russia, including preventive sanction pressure. He said that only coordinated and decisive actions of all European partners in the political, diplomatic, informational, economic and other fields can stop Russian aggression. The deputy head of the Office of the President said that the readiness of the Western world to practically oppose the aggressive behavior of the Russian Federation can protect democratic values, international principles and preserve world order. ""It will be too late to impose sanctions after the start of the Russian invasion and to express concern, as the notion of the democratic values of Western society will already be undermined. Russia will not stop its aggression against the EU and NATO, which it started in 2008 against Georgia and continued in 2014 against Ukraine,"" Mashovets said. The deputy head of the Office of the President proposed that assistance to Ukraine for strengthening its defense capabilities, which is the main deterrent to Russia, is increased and artificial restrictions in this process are not created. The importance of stopping the Nord Stream 2 project was stressed, which will be a clear signal of the determination of Germany and other European countries to resist Russian aggression. The German minister of state welcomed the bilateral dialogue on security issues launched this week in Brussels by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. He reiterated Germany's continued support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our state. Lindner said that Germany is ready to take decisive action in support of Ukraine and adheres to the policy of dialogue and political and diplomatic settlement of the situation. He said that Germany supports the full implementation of the provisions of the Budapest Memorandum and never recognizes the illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula by Russia."

According to Shurma, thermal modernization of social facilities will be carried out synchronously. ""In general, we expect that this will reduce gas consumption in our country by 30-40% cumulatively,"" he said. In addition, a program to increase the production of natural gas and other minerals in Ukraine will be implemented. ""To increase production from current 18-19 billion cubic meters to at least 23-25 billion cubic meters of gas over the next three or four years,"" the deputy head of the President's Office said."

Office of Representative of President of Ukraine in Autonomous Republic of Crimea steps up Ukrainian peninsula reintegration and de-occupation efforts,2021-12-17T11:31:00Z,"Today, the Office of Representative of the President of Ukraine in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea celebrates its 29th anniversary. After President Volodymyr Zelenskyy changed the approach to the role of this body, the Office of Representative became more actively involved in the process of returning the temporarily occupied territories of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, Permanent Representative of the President to the Autonomous Republic of Crimea Anton Korynevych has said. On December 17, 1992, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted Law No. 2875-XII ""On the Office of Representative of the President of Ukraine in the Republic of Crimea."" The day of its approval became the date of the establishment of the Office of Representative. Thus began the first steps of a historically important activity. In the spring of 2014, after the beginning of the temporary occupation of the Crimean peninsula by the Russian Federation, the Office of Representative of the President of Ukraine in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea resumes its activities near the peninsula – in the city of Kherson. Given the numerous violations of human rights by the Russian Federation and the importance of developing a policy of de-occupation and reintegration, in 2019 the head of state decided to open the Office of Representative in Kyiv, which took over a number of strategic issues, and the office in Kherson continued to work on the implementation of tactical challenges and with citizens' appeals. In 2019, Zelenskyy appointed Anton Korynevych as Permanent Representative of the President of Ukraine in Crimea, and Daria Svyrydova and Tamila Tasheva became his deputies. On March 11, 2021, Zelenskyy, by his decree, put into effect the decision of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine ""On the Strategy for the De-occupation and Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territory of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol,"" on the text of which the updated team of the Office of Representative was actively working. On April 13, 2021, the President of Ukraine signed decree No. 160/2021 ""On the priority areas of activity of the Office of Representative of the President of Ukraine in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea,"" which for the first time approved the strategy for the activities of this body under the conditions of temporary occupation. The Office of Representative, together with partners, is working on the development of initiatives aimed at implementing the strategy for the de-occupation and reintegration of Crimea, the development of a transitional justice policy, the observance of human rights and the implementation of other steps aimed at restoring the territorial integrity of Ukraine and protecting our citizens living in the temporarily occupied territories. Among the tasks of the Office of Representative: ● simplification of citizens' access to administrative services; ● ensuring access to health services; ● implementation of the rights of young people to access Ukrainian education; ● availability and improvement of conditions for crossing the administrative border; ● development and strengthening of the level of trust in public institutions; ● documenting human rights violations; ● regulation of criminal legislation to ensure the principle of inevitability of punishment for grave crimes; ● assistance in the imposition of sanctions against persons involved in the occupation and its consequences, and more. On February 26, 2020, Zelenskyy, by his decree No. 58/2020, declared in Ukraine the Day of Resistance to Occupation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol. This important date is celebrated every year and bears truth and justice, because we must remember that our citizens resisted the occupation of Crimea to the last, despite the propaganda of the Russian Federation. Special attention is paid to the protection of the rights of core nations, in particular, the Crimean Tatars. On July 1, 2021, the Verkhovna Rada adopted Law No. 1616-IX ""On the Indigenous Peoples of Ukraine,"" intended to put the historical record straight. The team of the Office of Representative together with the Ministry for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories, experts from human rights organizations joined in the development of a bill ""On social and legal protection of persons in respect of whom the fact of deprivation of personal liberty as a result of armed aggression against Ukraine and their families,"" which the President Of Ukraine submitted as urgent to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine in September 2021. The Office of Representative was involved in the implementation of the key initiative of the Head of State regarding the de-occupation of Crimea – the launch of the international Crimea Platform. On August 23, the constitutive summit of the initiative was held, which was attended by 46 delegations from the countries of the world and international organizations. As part of the Office of Representative, the Service for the Support of the Crimea Platform was created, which on the day of the summit opened the national office of the Crimea Platform in the center of Kyiv. Today, 34 team members work in the Office of Representative, some of whom are Crimean in origin. For them, de-occupation and reintegration is a personal mission on the way home and the return of the Crimean peninsula. It was very important for us to assemble a professional team and be able to be included in the discussion of the future of the Crimean peninsula at all levels. Changing the approach to the role of the Office of Representative and the opportunity to have a full-time office in Kyiv that ensures our work and enhances interagency cooperation is an important step of the President of Ukraine in shaping a consistent policy for the return of Crimea. Thanks to the amendments to the decree on the Office of Representative, we are now included in the processes concerning the return of the temporarily occupied territories of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, and today we are ready to show our first results,"" Korynevych said. He expressed his conviction that the Office of Representative of the President of Ukraine in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea will definitely reopen its doors in the city of Simferopol. ""Twenty nine years is the period when we draw conclusions, share victories and continue to work further along the path of the de-occupation and reintegration of Crimea. We are working to restore the constitutional order in the temporarily occupied territories and return freedom and human rights for every citizen living in Crimea,"" the permanent representative of the Head of State said."
"The consequences of a possible Russian escalation against Ukraine will be significant, and it is important that this price is understood in Russia and in Europe - President",2021-12-16T14:05:00Z,"The Russian Federation and some European countries need to understand the extent of Russia's possible military escalation of Ukraine. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the media following the talks with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in Brussels. ""What I hear is that most countries of the European Union and the Eastern Partnership support Ukraine's position. Everyone understands that the price will be very high. But no one even imagines the amount of casualties and lives lost. Nobody wants that. I am not sure that all European leaders have the same understanding (of this situation - ed.), because not all leaders, unfortunately, understand in general what is happening on our borders,"" he said. Therefore, as Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted, every time leaders of European countries arrive in Ukraine, he invites them to come to Donbas, to the touch line and see everything for themselves. ""It is on the touch line in Donbas that you can see what is really happening. Both the military and civilians can tell a lot, especially in those settlements that were occupied and then liberated. They understand the difference, they understand the price of war,"" the President said. In his opinion, the most important thing is that the Russian Federation understands this price. ""Because they will lose people, too. God forbid. After all, we believe in the diplomatic format of the talks,"" the President of Ukraine stressed. For his part, Jens Stoltenberg noted that Ukraine, like all sovereign states, has the right to defend itself - it is stated in the UN Charter. He noted that NATO supports Ukraine by providing advisers and instructors, equipment, holding joint exercises and more. ""If there is aggression against Ukraine in the future, it will have severe consequences and a very high price,"" said the Secretary General of the Alliance."
"President: Ukraine's membership in NATO is a matter for the Ukrainian people and members of the Alliance, not for any other country",2021-12-16T13:33:00Z,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hopes that in the issue of Ukraine's Euro-Atlantic prospects, NATO member states will be guided by the position and choice of the Ukrainian people, without giving in to threats and any ""red lines"" of other states. Volodymyr Zelenskyy told this to the media following the negotiations with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in Brussels. ""We have held meaningful consultations with Mr. Secretary General of the North Atlantic Alliance on ways to strengthen cooperation between Ukraine and NATO, taking into account the current very dangerous challenges. First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to NATO and personally to Mr. Stoltenberg for his continued support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country within internationally recognized borders,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The President stated that the situation in the temporarily occupied Crimea, Donbas, around the Ukrainian borders and in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov is a group of hybrid elements that the Russian side uses to blackmail and put pressure on the Ukrainian state and democracy. Also, in order to destabilize the situation in the region, a ""migrant crisis"" and an energy crisis are being artificially created, disinformation is being spread, and cyberattacks are being carried out. ""These are elements of the overall scenario of destabilizing the security situation in the region, Ukraine and Europe as a whole. Their goal is to destabilize the situation on the borders with NATO, to create a narrative in societies about the weakness of allies, to block Ukraine's Euro-Atlantic integration,"" the President said. At the same time, he stressed that Ukraine's membership in NATO is a personal choice of the Ukrainian people. ""Our Euro-Atlantic course remains the same. Support for this course keeps growing in Ukrainian society,"" the Head of State stressed. Answering journalists' questions, Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that support for NATO membership in Ukraine had remained at 50% for many years, but had risen significantly since the 2014 war and Russia's occupation of the Crimean peninsula. ""I believe that Russia has pushed Ukraine into NATO. I believe that today Russia is “paving” Ukraine's difficult way to NATO,"" the President said. The President expressed gratitude for the fact that in the Brussels Communiqué (June 2021) the Allies stated their firm support for Ukraine's right to determine its own future and foreign policy without outside interference. ""I am very grateful for the clear signal that the issue of Ukraine's membership in NATO is a matter of relations between Ukraine and the Alliance. And it certainly should not be the choice of any state in any part of the world. I sincerely hope that the Allies will continue to be guided by these positions without giving in to threats and any ""red lines"" drawn by other parties,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The President of Ukraine also reminded that next year marks 25 years since the conclusion of the Charter on a Special Partnership between Ukraine and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization signed in Madrid. In this context, Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the NATO summit, which will also take place in Madrid in June 2022, a ""window of opportunity"". For his part, Jens Stoltenberg stressed that Russia must return to diplomacy and de-escalation of the situation, as well as respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. ""The decision on whether Ukraine can join NATO will be made only by Ukraine and the thirty members of the Alliance,"" said the NATO Secretary General."

The President congratulated Karl Nehammer on his appointment to the high post and expressed his conviction that the common historical past and respect for basic values will help further strengthen Ukrainian-Austrian cooperation. The prospects of such cooperation are confirmed by the tangible results of the official visit of the President of Ukraine to Austria in September 2020. ""Some of our agreements are already being implemented, as Austrian business recognizes the positive effect of domestic reforms in Ukraine and opens new perspectives in our market,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Austria is confidently ranked sixth among the largest investors in the economy of our country. The growth of bilateral trade by 63% over the last nine months indicates the high potential for its further development. Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed that Ukrainian-Austrian cooperation will also contribute to the further promotion of Ukrainian business in the EU internal market, in particular within the Eastern Partnership, and expressed hope that Austria would fix Ukraine's European perspective in a joint declaration.

We welcomed the Joint Declaration of the Eastern Partnership Summit ‘Recovery, Resilience and Reform' issued today in Brussels, and by endorsing long-term policy objectives and the next generation of post-2020 priorities reaffirm our strong commitment to strategic, ambitious and forward looking Eastern Partnership based on common fundamental values, mutual interests and shared ownership and responsibility. We welcomed the endorsement by the EaP Summit the Economic and Investment Plan for the Eastern Partnership, which includes concrete flagship initiatives for Partner Countries. We reemphasized that the Association Trio initiative promoting European choice, European aspirations and European identity of their peoples, designed to enhance cooperation on European integration, remains committed to further strategic development of the Eastern Partnership in line with the principles of differentiation and inclusivity.  We reaffirmed our strong commitment to further strengthening the political association and economic integration of Georgia, Republic of Moldova and Ukraine with the European Union, including through continued close cooperation to strengthen the rule of law and advance reforms to meet the Copenhagen criteria. We recalled that according to Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union any European state which respects the values referred to in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union and is committed to promoting them may apply to become a member of the European Union. We noted that respect for the common values and implementation of the Association Agreements/DCFTAs will contribute to the future progressive developments in our relationships. We recalled that the effective implementation of the AAs and their DCFTAs, including the broader process of legislative approximation, will contribute to further economic integration with the European Union Internal Market as envisaged in the Association Agreements.  We acknowledged the need to enhance cooperation of the Association Trio with the EU aiming at increased coordination among them on matters of common interest related to advancing the European Integration, including recognition of the European perspective of the Association Trio by the EU.  We emphasized that building on the positive experience of informal DCFTA ministerial meetings, the Association Trio is looking forward to extending enhanced sectoral cooperation with the EU to other areas in particular green and digital transitions, connectivity, energy security, justice and home affairs, strategic communication and healthcare.  We expressed our interest in deepening cooperation of the Trio countries with the EU with the aim of integration into the EU Digital Single Market, including by means of participation in Digital Europe, Connecting Europe Facility as well as reducing roaming charges between the EU and the Association Trio.

We noted the need of enhancing connectivity and transport links between the EU and the Association Trio including through road transport market liberalization, developing transport corridors as well as realization of joint infrastructure projects with support of Eastern Partnership Economic and Investment Plan. We acknowledged that dramatic changes of the situation in the Eastern Partnership and Black Sea region since the 5th Eastern Partnership Summit in 2017, including security, energy, health and other emerging challenges should be collectively addressed by the Partner countries in close cooperation with the EU. We emphasize that continuous destabilisation and violations of the principles of international law in many parts of the EaP region pose a serious threat to peace, security and stability in Europe. We welcomed EU’s active efforts in conflict resolution and confidence building processes and called for its strengthened role in facilitation of peace and stability in the EaP region using all available instruments including relevant restrictive measures when necessary. We called on the EU leaders to address these issues at the meeting of the European Council on 16 December 2021. We recalled that Russia’s annexation attempts and illegal occupation of the territories of Georgia, its aggression in the east of Ukraine and temporary occupation of Crimea as well as the unresolved conflict in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova pose a serious threat to the region and Europe as a whole. We reiterated our strong condemnation of the clear violation of sovereignty and territorial integrity of a number of EaP states, including incitement and support of conflicts, using disinformation and cyberattacks, increasing militarisation of the region, violations of human rights, or holding elections on temporarily occupied territories. We also noted the importance of further enhancing resilience and cooperation in the area of Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) with the EU and recalled our joint commitment to promote the principles enshrined in the Association Agreements. We looked forward to developing cooperation with EU agencies and mechanisms, including the European Peace Facility and participation in PESCO projects. We also expressed our interest to engage in a dialogue with the EU on the basis of the Security Compass initiative.  We reiterated our determination backed by the strong will of our peoples to work towards joining the European Union.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an interview for La Repubblica: Russia threatens Ukraine to blackmail the West,2021-12-14T10:47:00Z,"Interview of President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the Italian newspaper La Repubblica. - President Zelenskyy, Vladimir Putin is again gathering his troops on the border with Ukraine. Do you think that this time military maneuvers pose a greater threat than usual? - What are the troops gathered near our border used for? This is the potential for blackmail. And first of all against the western states. But if the number of Russian troops grows, blackmail will become even more severe, which can be called preparation for the expansion of aggression against our state and, perhaps, the region as a whole. Ukraine sees no surprises in what is happening on our eastern borders. Russia started this war in 2014, and since then we have been ready for any scenario. Unfortunately, this cannot be said of all European countries. For example, Germany has recently prevented us from receiving anti-drone rifles and anti-sniper systems, which are exclusively defense tools, from NATO. Are we not entitled to them in the eighth year of the war? Obviously we are. Any democracy that protects itself from aggression should have the right to acquire such defense instruments. But in some capitals, fear still prevails. - Europe and the United States without delay condemned the Kremlin, again standing side by side with Kyiv. But if Russians decide to invade your country tomorrow, will the Ukrainian army be ready to resist them? - We will defend our land and our people under all circumstances and from any encroachments. Ukrainians will never give up their freedom. Meanwhile, a museum with a collection of various condemnations may already be opened in Moscow. Undoubtedly, we are grateful for the support, but collective efforts are not enough yet to return the Russian side not only to the projected policy, which would be based on respect for international law and neighboring countries, but also to meaningful negotiations for peace in the east of Ukraine. An example is one of the agreements of the Normandy summit in Paris in 2019, which is still not being implemented - the agreement on prisoners. Hundreds of our people are being held captive in the occupied territories, and Russia has made a clear promise to ensure full and unconditional admission of international organizations to them. But this is not happening because Ukrainian prisoners are in such a terrible state that Russia cannot show them to the Red Cross. - Have you thought about the possible number of casualties on both sides in the event of war? - Precisely because we think about the possible number of casualties, we constantly insist on intensifying diplomacy. We do not resort to saber-rattling, we do not gather troops on the border, we do not take forceful steps towards the occupied territory of our state. During the war we have already had about 15 thousand dead. One and a half million Ukrainians were forced to flee their homes and became IDPs. If we talk about the price not of local but of wider conflict, it is clear that the number of human losses can be much higher. In particular, for Russians. Is Russian society ready to pay with the lives of its sons for the attempt to occupy another part of Ukraine? - Meanwhile, people are dying in Donbas. Why, after almost eight years, are there no changes in this conflict that would lead to peace? - Ukraine is ready to make all the necessary efforts to make peace honest and lasting. This interview will turn into a thick book if I begin to list all the proposals and efforts to intensify the negotiations that the Russian side has received from us during the war. But one small paragraph will suffice to retell Russia's answers, because they all boil down to an unwillingness to recognize oneself as a party to this war. Its role at the negotiating table is to insist on talking to separatists in Donbas. And who are these separatists? In the occupied territories, everything is run by Russian officers and Russian officials. - Now Vladimir Putin demands written guarantees, such as, for example, Kyiv's preventive refusal to join NATO. Would you be willing to abandon this idea in exchange for a guaranteed withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine's borders? - Our state gave up its part of the Soviet nuclear arsenal - the third largest in the world, and in return received, in particular from Russia, assurances to respect our borders and our security. All this was thrown away. So it is strange to hear from the Russian side a request for any guarantees, when so many promises have already been broken by the Russian side itself. - Do you think that the threats of ""very tough economic sanctions"" voiced by Joseph Biden are enough to stop Moscow? - After the talks between the American and Russian leaders, there is no reduction of the military group near our borders. Moreover, there is another space for escalation - in the Sea of Azov, where 70% of the water area is blocked by Russia. When this starts to change, we can say that the arguments sound convincing. - Don't you think that hindering the newly built Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which Moscow plans to use to transport 55 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year to Germany and other European countries, will be enough to put pressure on Vladimir Putin? - The very fact that Nord Stream 2 can hypothetically be put into operation is extremely destabilizing for our region. Russia is investing in various levers of pressure on European countries to make this pipeline work, which will mean the end of gas transportation through Ukraine. If this happens, the security of eastern and central Europe will collapse instantly. - You are currently conducting an active dialogue with EU leaders. What exactly do you expect from Europe and, in particular, from Italy? - Maybe someone is afraid of Ukraine's economic potential, but Italy and other countries will only benefit if Ukraine becomes a full member of the European community. The Italians have no less political weight in talking to Russia about peace in Europe than other countries already involved in the negotiation effort. Christmas is ahead - and so now is the time to try as much as possible to agree on a ceasefire, the release of prisoners and the creation of conditions for the safe movement of people. I am confident that Italy can say its word, which will be heard in Moscow, and Vladimir Putin will not be able to ignore it."
"From January, a thousand hryvnias received by vaccinated citizens of Ukraine can be spent on medicines - meeting with the President",2021-12-13T14:55:00Z,"In Ukraine, more than 40% of adult citizens have already received a full course of vaccination against COVID-19. In January 2022, the list of goods and services that can be purchased for UAH 1,000 provided by the state to every Ukrainian who has received a full course of vaccination will be expanded. This was discussed at a conference call chaired by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ""Starting from December 19, fully vaccinated Ukrainians will receive one thousand hryvnias. They will be able to spend these funds on the spheres most affected by the pandemic - gym, cinema, museum or concert, buy a train or plane ticket, buy books. At the same time, after listening to the wishes of our elderly citizens, for whom maintaining health is important, especially in a pandemic, it was decided to add medicines to the list of available goods,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Head of State expressed confidence that such a step would increase the number of vaccinations against COVID-19 among the elderly, as well as contribute to the treatment and prevention of other diseases. Currently, the Ministry of Digital Transformation is finalizing the technical possibilities to make the purchase of drugs for vaccination funds available from January next year. In total, according to Health Minister Viktor Lyashko, today Ukraine has surpassed 40% of adults vaccinated: out of 14.1 million, 12 million have received two COVID-19 vaccinations. However, Viktor Lyashko noted that the rate of vaccination has been declining over the past two weeks. In this context, the President stressed the need to intensify vaccination, because despite the improvement of the epidemic situation in the country, weekly incidence rates remain high. According to the government, 61,000 new cases of COVID-19 were detected in Ukraine last week. Today there are almost 300,000 active patients. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal reminded that since December 7, nine regions have left the ""red"" zone, and now Vinnytsia region meets the criteria for leaving it, so the issue of its transfer to the ""yellow"" zone will be considered. Also, in order to minimize the risks for patients with COVID-19 among citizens over the age of 60, the standards of medical care for COVID-19 disease were amended and the criteria for hospitalization of this category of patients were expanded. Given the approaching Christmas and New Year holidays, the relevant orders of the Ministry of Health and the Chief Public Health Officer on anti-epidemic measures during the operation of ski resorts were adopted. Denys Shmyhal also said that anti-epidemic measures had been developed separately during large-scale mass events. According to the National Security and Defense Council, the epidemic situation in our country during the holidays should be stable. A new strain of coronavirus, Omicron, is expected to appear in Ukraine this week. But the results of the first studies in the countries where it has already been detected, indicate a milder course of the disease, said Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksiy Danilov."
Head of State: We have done everything to make Russia say today that it is not going to invade Ukraine,2021-12-10T23:16:00Z,"During a phone conversation with US President Joseph Biden, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke about the possibility of creating another platform with the United States for negotiations with the Russian Federation on ending the war in Donbas and restoring Ukraine's territorial integrity. The Head of State spoke about this in an interview for 1 + 1 TV channel. ""The United States will be interested in a role in the Normandy format if it really decides something important, not just moderating the process or watching from the sidelines. It can also be a separate platform that can cooperate with the “Normandy Four"". This may be a single plan, where some issues are discussed on a separate platform, where, for example, Ukraine, the United States and Russia are present, and some very important things are discussed in the Normandy format,” said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The President noted that it is important for Ukraine not to lose the Normandy format, because our country's partners are really interested in resolving the conflict in Donbas. ""Emmanuel Macron is interested. Today he is one of the leaders of Europe, who is clearly interested in the development and implementation of the Normandy format. That's why his reaction is very important to me. I will soon meet the new Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz. Today I have a reaction that everyone stands for having several ways, everyone wants as many countries as possible to do everything possible to stop the war in the east of Ukraine,"" he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also stressed that he did not rule out a separate format of direct talks with the President of the Russian Federation. ""I see support for this direction from both our European partners and the United States,"" the President said. At the same time, according to the President, in his conversation with Joseph Biden, there were no proposals to conduct a direct dialogue between Ukraine and the leaders of the so-called illegal groups in Donbas. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also added that Emmanuel Macron constantly emphasizes that Ukraine should not be left alone with representatives of illegal armed groups, as the Russian Federation wants. The Head of State noted that during the talks with the American leader it was agreed that Ukraine would be a subject and participant in any meetings with the participation of other states concerning our country. The President of Ukraine said that during a conversation with Joseph Biden, he received a message of assurances from Russia that it is not going to continue the escalation as regards the territories of our state. ""It seems to me that this is a small and not final, but still very important result. We have done everything to make Russia tell the United States that it is not going to invade (Ukraine - ed.),"" he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that today it is difficult to get specifics about this situation, because the President of Russia is interested in talks with the President of the United States and is not interested in talks with anyone else. ""We have united everyone, and everyone understands that a serious package of sanctions is being prepared in case of any challenges, any, even small, escalation from Russia,"" the Head of State stressed. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also reminded that all current powerful sanctions remain in force, even though other states suffer because of this sanctions policy. Asked about the possibility of holding a referendum on the special status of certain districts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the President said that he does not rule out the possibility of a ""referendum on Donbas as a whole"" as part of a number of agreements, but today such an expression of will is not considered. ""It could be about Donbas, about Crimea, it could be about ending the war in general. This or that country may offer us certain conditions. This is not the case today. That is, I have no secrets from society here. I would not joke with such things. But if there is such a difficult challenge, I will definitely consult with our society,"" the President said. At the same time, Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that Ukraine will definitely not give up its territories."
Ukrainian society does not support coup attempts - President,2021-12-10T22:46:00Z,"Ukrainian society has not and does not support coup attempts in our country.

And I am very happy that these groups saw that the society does not support them. But we are monitoring the situation very closely,"" the President said. The President noted that he cannot reveal all the details, but he believes that the plans of some forces to forcibly change the government in Ukraine have not changed globally. However, they received signals, including from Ukraine's international partners, that forced them to halt their intentions. ""I think some people received a message from our strategic partners - some had dialogues, received certain signals. I think they have changed their plans a little bit, ""Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The Head of State also drew attention to the fact that some oligarchs are trying to blackmail the government with possible power outages in some regions of Ukraine. But there will be no mass shutdowns, he assured. ""Blackmail at the local level will take place. These are steps to make a kind of information wave, to show it in the media… Globally, we have a stable energy situation, as I promised. Because we agreed on this both at the local level and with all representatives of power generation. We have everything to ensure a normal, stable heating season. Tariffs will be normal, as we said. There will be no mass shutdowns,"" the President stressed."

Therefore, Ukraine will continue its Euro-Atlantic integration, but must rely on its Armed Forces first. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an interview for 1 + 1 TV channel. ""It seems to me that President Biden said this not only to me, but he said publicly that NATO and membership in the Alliance is a choice not of the United States, Russia or any Alliance country. This is the choice of the society of Ukraine, the choice of the citizens of Ukraine,"" the Head of State said. ""Unfortunately, he did not add that it is not the citizens of Ukraine who decide, but the countries I mentioned,"" the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that the United States and the European Union support our country and note that Ukraine does not give in to provocations from Russia and illegal groups in Donbas.

And here the question is definitely not in the number,"" the Head of State noted. According to the President, Ukraine has shown its strength in resisting the armed aggression in Donbas. ""Everyone is ready at any moment to become military and defend their state. I think this is the strongest Alliance for us today.

A person should be held criminally liable for intentional attempts to conceal the fact of dual citizenship,” the President stressed. In addition, the Head of State submitted to the Verkhovna Rada a bill ""On Amendments to the Law of Ukraine ""On the Judiciary and the Status of Judges"" on Preventing and Counteracting Threats to National Security of Ukraine in the Sphere of Citizenship"". This document aims to counteract the use of foreign citizenship by Ukrainian citizens as an instrument of interference in the internal affairs of Ukraine, encroachment on the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state. ""We propose to impose restrictions on the holding of positions in the judiciary by citizens of Ukraine who have acquired the citizenship of another state,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The President also submitted to the Parliament a draft law ""On Amendments to Article 570 of the Customs Code of Ukraine on Preventing and Counteracting Threats to National Security of Ukraine in the Sphere of Citizenship"", which proposes to impose restrictions on holding positions in customs bodies by citizens of Ukraine who have acquired citizenship of a foreign state or states. The President calls on the people's deputies of all factions and groups to support the bills submitted by him. The adoption of these documents will be the next step in the formation and improvement of the institution of citizenship of Ukraine."
President congratulated the staff of the prosecution on the 30th anniversary of its establishment,2021-12-01T16:02:00Z,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy took part in the celebrations on the occasion of the Day of Prosecutors of Ukraine and the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the prosecution, which took place in the Office of the Prosecutor General. Congratulating those present on their professional holiday, the Head of State stressed that prosecutors play a leading role in strengthening law and order, reliable protection of human and civil rights and freedoms, interests of society and the state, preservation of civil peace and tranquility. That is why the reform of the agency was important as it made the prosecutor's office an independent element of the overall justice system with completely new values and principles of activity - efficiency, professionalism and integrity. ""The Prosecutor's Office of Ukraine is 30 years old. May all criminals, corrupt officials and enemies of Ukraine get at least the same number of years of imprisonment thanks to your work,"" the President said in his speech. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also presented state awards for significant personal contribution to strengthening the rule of law in the state, protection of the rights and freedoms of citizens, exemplary performance of official duties and high professionalism. Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova stressed that the process of reforming the agency was launched with the support of the incumbent President in 2019. She stated that 2/3 of the prosecutors successfully passed the recertification, and the vacancies were filled with qualified specialists - lawyers from outside the system who have a new vision of work. According to Iryna Venediktova, one of the main tasks of the renewed body is to increase the level of public trust in prosecutors and the prosecutor's office due to effective work. ""I am proud that today the renewed prosecutor's office is not an isolated agency for serving private interests, but an independent justice system with new values and approaches enshrined in the Development Strategy, which takes into account the best European standards. We are open to anyone who needs protection from wrongdoing and who seeks justice. That is why we are introducing new approaches in the work of public reception offices,"" said the Prosecutor General. She also noted that the agency has now changed its approach to protecting business, children's rights, combating domestic violence and more."
President delivered the annual Address on the Internal and External Situation of Ukraine to the Parliament and presented state awards,2021-12-01T12:44:00Z,"In accordance with Article 106 of the Constitution, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered the annual Address on the Internal and External Situation of Ukraine to the Verkhovna Rada and presented state awards. The plenary session of the Parliament was also attended by Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, government representatives, heads of central executive bodies, heads of the judiciary, judges of the Constitutional Court, heads of regional councils, heads of diplomatic missions of foreign states and international organizations. For the first time, members of the public, including relatives of the fallen defenders of Ukraine, were invited to the plenary session of the Verkhovna Rada. The Head of State called it symbolic that his address with the annual message on the internal and external situation of Ukraine takes place today, on the 30th anniversary of the All-Ukrainian referendum on Ukraine's independence. ""On December 1, 1991, the All-Ukrainian referendum on the independence of Ukraine was held, which was supported by the vast majority of Ukrainian citizens. From all regions, including Donbas and Crimea. We took a big step 30 years ago. But we did not go further. We restored, proclaimed, chose and gained an independent Ukraine. But we never started building it. Independent from other people's influence and other people's interests,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. ""We have all been building such a country for the last two and a half years. Really free, really independent,"" he added. After delivering his annual Address to the Verkhovna Rada, the President of Ukraine presented state awards and honorary titles on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the All-Ukrainian referendum on Ukraine's independence."
President: We will not be able to stop the war and return the territories without our troops and without direct talks with Russia,2021-12-01T12:20:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that he is ready for direct talks with the leadership of the Russian Federation, which annexed Crimea and is waging war with our state in Donbas, to establish peace and return the temporarily occupied Ukrainian territories. During this address to the Verkhovna Rada on the internal and external situation in Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized: “The war in Donbas has been going on for eight years. Eight years since Russia has annexed Crimea. And I'm not afraid to tell everyone about it and tell this directly to Russians. That's why, at the same time, I'm not afraid to talk to them directly. We are not afraid of direct dialogue."" According to him, Ukraine understands perfectly well which European countries support Ukraine and which of them only pretend to support us. At the same time, the President noted that Ukraine can be protected only by its strong, powerful army, on which it relies primarily. ""And we have to admit that without our army we will not be able to stop the war. And we must tell the truth that we will not be able to stop the war without direct talks with Russia. And today all external partners have already recognized this. And some internal partners do not recognize this. We must speak, knowing that we have a strong, powerful army. And we must not be afraid to tell each other the truth now, if we want to return Donbas. And if we just want to talk about it, let's do nothing,"" the Head of State said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on all politicians, regardless of party affiliation, as well as all businessmen to fight together for the Ukrainian state and for the return of its territories."
Volodymyr Zelenskyy initiates the introduction of multiple citizenship for Ukrainians,2021-12-01T12:07:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy is submitting to the Verkhovna Rada a bill on the introduction of multiple citizenship for Ukrainians abroad. The Head of State said this during his address to the Verkhovna Rada on the internal and external situation in Ukraine. ""An important component of our international policy is to support Ukrainians in the world. I know how important the issue of multiple citizenship is for Ukrainians living in the United States, Canada and the EU. Today I am submitting the relevant bill to the Parliament. There are 65 million of us,” the President said. According to the Head of State, for the first time Ukrainians all over the world ""will feel not like a diaspora or just people of ""Ukrainian origin"", but like people of Ukrainian citizenship."" ""Equal Ukrainians. And this is also part of independence, when people with equal rights drive on smooth roads,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed."
Speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Verkhovna Rada with the Annual Address on the Internal and External Situation of Ukraine,2021-12-01T11:59:00Z,"Dear citizens of Ukraine! Dear Ukrainian people! A year ago, I began my address by saying that its format should be changed. And, in addition to people's deputies, I should report directly to the people who hired all of us for five years, hired me! These are our military and their families, our doctors, scientists, students, artists, athletes. Citizens of Ukraine. From all regions of Ukraine, including our Donbas and Crimea. I am glad to begin this address today by welcoming all of them in this room! This is especially symbolic today. On a significant day that happened exactly 30 years ago. On December 1, 1991, the All-Ukrainian referendum on Ukraine's independence was held, supported by an absolute majority of Ukrainian citizens. From all regions, including Donbas and Crimea. We took a big step 30 years ago. But we did not go further. We restored, proclaimed, chose and gained an independent Ukraine. But we never started building it. Independent of other people's influence and other people's interests. Where the law is one for all, and the law decides everything. Not one decides everything, and for all this is the law. Where the Constitution is a big social contract, not a small backstage ""contract"". Where politicians work for 100% of citizens, not for 20% of GDP of one citizen. Such a country has not been built for many years. We have all been building such a country for the last two and a half years. Really free and independent state. An independent country is first and foremost a healthy country. We have been opposing COVID-19 for two years. We started with almost nothing. And it's true. Now we have almost everything. Hospitals, beds, oxygen and, most importantly, vaccines. Yesterday we did not know how to distribute the first batch of 500 thousand doses. And now, millions of doses of AstraZeneca, CoronaVac, Pfizer and Moderna are available. We started with ten thousand vaccinations a day. In November, we made 6.5 million. Thanks to our doctors. And in total today we have already carried out 24 million vaccinations.  But I do not want the main word of my address today to be ""covid"", and I do not want it to be the word ""lockdown"". I want this to be the main association with our country - I want the phrase ""for the first time"" to always be next to the word ""Ukraine"". I will talk about the main things: what was done for the first time and what will happen next. Despite the global pandemic and the economic crisis caused by this pandemic, we have stabilized the economic situation. In 2021, the size of Ukraine's economy will reach a record high for the first time since independence - more than $ 190 billion. This is more than in the pre-crisis years of 2008 and 2013. For the first time since 2013, we will reduce public debt to below 50% of GDP. Despite the fact that in recent years in most countries it has grown rapidly and on average in the world exceeds 90%. Our gold and foreign exchange reserves have grown to $ 30 billion today. This is the highest figure since 2013. For the first time in the history of independent Ukraine, the loan rate for small and medium-sized businesses fell below 10%. Currently, it is an average of 9.7%. Thanks to the Affordable Loans 5-7-9 program, Ukrainian small and medium-sized businesses received more than 70 billion hryvnias and created thousands of new jobs. We will soon launch the Ukrainian Dream program, under which every citizen of our country who pays taxes honestly will be able to get a loan at a rate of 5% in hryvnia to buy real estate in a new house, electric car, get education or change profession. Energy crisis, restrictions on electricity supply, significant increase in tariffs. For the first time, this is not about Ukraine. This is the reality of the whole world, despite which we have managed to maintain stability in the energy sector, curb rising prices for housing and communal services, and even reduce electricity prices for the population. In 2022, we will begin the ""Large Thermo-Modernization"". We plan to insulate thousands of high-rise buildings, schools, kindergartens and hospitals. This will allow us to insure against further increases in energy prices and for the first time to gain true energy independence. Dear MPs, I would like to thank the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine - yesterday we passed a very important tax law № 5600, which increases the rent: the fee for the use of natural resources. We will direct these funds to our children. Therefore, for the first time in history, I will introduce a bill on the economic passport of a Ukrainian by December 10. According to it, these funds - the fee for the use of our subsoil - will be accumulated on the personal accounts of children of Ukrainian citizens. After reaching the age of majority, our children will be able to use this money to get an education in Ukraine or buy their own housing in Ukraine. Thanks to these two laws, our oligarchs will finally become real investors in the future of our children. Congratulations to them. And this will also be the first time since the independence of our state. As of today, the minimum wage in Ukraine is 6.5 thousand hryvnias. We have not only raised the minimum wage. For the first time in 30 years, the average wage in dollar terms has exceeded $ 500 a month. For the first time, doctors' salaries have doubled in a year. From the new year, from January 1, it will be at least 20 thousand hryvnias, and the average salary of a doctor in Ukraine will be 24 thousand hryvnias. For the first time, we begin to treat the doctor properly, and not only when we need it. And I am sure that in my next address I will say the same words about the salaries of our teachers. But it's not just about raising wages. Compared to 2019, the budget for medicine has doubled. For the first time in the history of independent Ukraine, we have fully equipped the fleet of ambulances, 100%. We repaired 600 rural outpatient clinics and more than 200 ER departments. And next year we will begin the reconstruction of 48 regional multidisciplinary clinical hospitals. 24 for adults, 24 for children. As well as 24 rehabilitation centers for our veterans. I am proud that next year, for the first time since the beginning of the war in the east, we will completely close the queue for apartments for all our veterans of the war in the east. Immediately after the veterans, we will begin the same process for all our servicemen. I am proud that the whole world applauds Ukrainian military intelligence for the rescue of almost a thousand people in Afghanistan. Glory to Ukraine! I am proud that for the first time in 30 years in 2022 the funding of the defense and security sector, all programs, will exceed 320 billion hryvnias. Especially given the fact that in 2018 this amount was 191.7 billion hryvnias. In the framework of these funds, we are launching for the first time a comprehensive missile program, a program to restore the Ukrainian fleet, and the creation of cyber troops in Ukraine. For the first time since independence, the state is building Antonov An-178 aircraft for its army. For the first time in Ukraine we are starting to build a military plant for the production of modern drones. For the first time in many years, the National Security and Defense Council has become truly concerned with the security and defense of the state. A state that is independent of thieves in law, smugglers, criminal bosses, agents of other states. Protecting its land, its subsoil, its drinking water, forests and all its strategic enterprises. We are building a country independent of the help and support of others. Which is always grateful for this - I thank every country - but never waits just for this, and above all counts on itself. We are not waiting for tens of months from the seizure of Crimea, but we are gathering dozens of countries for its liberation and launching the Crimea Platform. Its first summit was attended by 46 delegations, leaders of the G7 and the EU: the United States, Germany, France, Turkey, all our friends, the leadership of NATO, the OSCE and the Council of Europe. For the first time since 2014, the deoccupation of Crimea was discussed at the highest international level. We have returned Crimea to the world agenda. The Crimea Platform will be enshrined in a UN General Assembly resolution. We are waiting for it to receive the official status of the international organization. For the first time since the occupation, we are fighting for Crimea not on billboards, but on all international platforms and meetings. Not by slogans, but by official documents. For the first time since 2014, the Strategy of deoccupation and reintegration of Crimea has been developed and approved. The area is 27 thousand square kilometers. Larger than some countries in Europe and the world. But we are not fighting for hectares, we're fighting for people, for our citizens. And for the first time in history, we passed a law on indigenous peoples, which consolidated the status and rights of Crimean Tatars. We are fighting for our youth and have significantly simplified access to higher education in Ukraine for schoolchildren from Crimea and the temporarily occupied Donbas: without external testing, free of charge, without restrictions, without any conditions at any university. We are fighting for the temporarily occupied consciousness of our citizens, so we launched a broadcast for the temporarily occupied territories. This is our land. Our goal is to release it. No one will do it for us. This is our philosophy. This year, we have maintained the bipartisan support of the United States and taken our relationship to a new, higher level. Following my meeting with President Biden, a Joint Statement was adopted. Military support. The Charter of Strategic Partnership between Ukraine and the United States has been updated. At the heart of our relations with the European Union is trust, solidarity and mutual support. This is evidenced by the results of the 23rd EU-Ukraine Summit and its ambitious final statement. Our goal is to implement the Association Agreement. According to government estimates, about 60% of all Ukraine's commitments under the Agreement have been fulfilled, with 25% this year alone. Thank you, dear people’s deputies. We prove every day that we are able not only to cooperate effectively with NATO in Alliance operations and exercises - cooperation in the Black Sea, the Lithuanian-Polish-Ukrainian Brigade - but also to defend democracy, freedom and our own state with weapons in hands. For the first time, together with the United Kingdom, we are implementing an ambitious project to develop the Ukrainian Navy worth £ 1.7 billion. We are already building the first corvette for our Navy with Turkey. For the first time, four large-scale agreements with France worth € 1.3 billion have been signed for major investment projects. We have achieved important results in cooperation with our partners: the IMF, the World Bank, the EBRD and other international institutions totaling more than $ 2.7 billion. For the first time, we have invited EU leaders to create a regional platform to strengthen energy security. The urgency of this initiative is confirmed by the current energy crisis in Europe. We consistently prove that Nord Stream 2 is an energy weapon that poses a threat to the entire region. We are grateful to all partners who support us. An important component of our international policy is to support Ukrainians in the world. I know how important the issue of multiple citizenship is for Ukrainians living in the United States, Canada, and the EU. Today I am submitting the relevant bill to the Parliament. There are 65 million of us. For the first time Ukrainians all over the world will feel not like a diaspora or just people of ""Ukrainian origin"", but like people of Ukrainian citizenship! Equal Ukrainians. And this is also part of independence, when people with equal rights drive on smooth roads. In 30 years, Ukrainians have become great drivers, learning to bypass potholes on the roads. For the first time in history, the opposition has criticized the government for building roads and bridges. Special criticism of the ""Large Construction"" comes from those who at their time in power could not make either medium or small construction. And they drove on the roads with holes, leaving the same holes in the budget. Everyone thought that good roads and Ukraine are antonyms. We have proved that they have become synonymous. We have already built 13,000 kilometers of roads. But there can’t be too many quality roads, so the goal for the next two years is not reduced - it's 15 thousand kilometers of roads. Another important area is the national bridge reconstruction program. 560 bridges and overpasses have already been built and renovated within it, including the legendary bridge in Zaporizhzhia, which was unfinished for 15 years. Over the next two years, we plan to connect the shores across our Ukraine with another 810 bridges and overpasses, including the Kremenchuh and Yampil bridges. Independence must be felt in the air. That is why we are creating a Ukrainian national air carrier. For the first time in many years, the carrier will be able to fly to our new regional airports that we are building. In total, we are currently building them in 16 cities of Ukraine. We also want to build an airport of international importance in Zakarpattia, between Uzhhorod and Mukachevo - this is a new project, and two airports in eastern Ukraine. Because Donbas is Ukraine. The first flight of the national carrier will take place in 2022. By 2025, the company's fleet will be fully formed - at least 20 aircraft. Regular flights will be launched both inside and outside. The Ukrainian carrier should be seen not only in Ukraine, but also all over the world. And this will be greatly helped by the open skies agreement, the visa-free air travel, which we have finally signed with the European Union. Therefore, UNA will definitely land in the EU. And such big plans really inspire. Independence is a natural driving force of every person. Therefore, we will launch 10 new Intercity + trains, 80 new electric trains and almost 500 new modern Ukrainian-made sleeping cars. An independent country is where you will be healthy, regardless of your social status. To do this, we launched the Healthy Ukraine program for the first time, within which we have already built 600 activity parks, 900 sports grounds, 193 stadiums and 25 swimming pools. There are 9,000 sports grounds ahead and the beginning of the state program - 19 ice arenas, hundreds of CYSS and sports boarding schools, new sports palaces. They will become our new places of strength and health of the nation, health of our future - our children. We have set clear goals from the very beginning. Driving children to schools and kindergartens must take no more than 30 minutes on a quality road. Everything must be clear, modern, and meet all international standards. And more and more such new schools and kindergartens must be built every day. So far we are building, maybe not too much, but more than 150 kindergartens. There will be another 300. 200 new schools have been built. There will be another 300. For the first time in many years we started to build our domestic locomotives and wagons in Kremenchuh. For the first time in many years, we began to build our modern Ukrainian tanks in Kharkiv. And this construction is really big and is getting bigger every day. Infrastructure is new jobs, a new quality of life for everyone. An independent country is a smart country. Educated. That is why a strong country is impossible with a weak education. We support talented students. New state and presidential prizes have been introduced: UAH 100,000 to the winners of international student competitions in mathematics, physics, computer science and chemistry. This year, for the first time, we are awarding prizes not only to the students, but also to the teachers who trained these champions. Graduates with the highest external testing score receive UAH 10,000 per month. 250 students. 10 best from each region of Ukraine. And for us, each region of Ukraine is the best. This year we have increased student scholarships to the subsistence level. At the same time, we will not reduce the number of scholarship holders. It is very important. This year we have provided more than 60,000 teachers with laptops, and by 2023 every teacher in our country will have a new laptop! For the first time for the state, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, aerospace, energy and biotechnology are not just clever words, but priority programs of study at the Presidential University, which we are beginning to create. Two years ago, the National Research Foundation was established. This is a grant support for science. In two years, 222 research projects received about 1 billion hryvnias. These are scientific developments involving more than 1,500 leading and young Ukrainian scientists. For the first time in many years we are restoring the scientific fleet of Ukraine. Imagine, the last voyage of a Ukrainian scientific ship in the World Ocean took place 20 years ago, and in the Black Sea - 10 years ago. We've got two ships this year - not many, but we got them! This is the ship ""Boris Alexandrov"", which will perform scientific and environmental research in the Black Sea, and the icebreaker ""Noosphere"" to explore the World Ocean, as well as to carry out our expeditions to the Ukrainian Vernadsky Research Base in Antarctica. Our independence is an opportunity to remember and cherish our past, being confident in the future. We are finally building the Babyn Yar Memorial Complex, and next year we will complete the construction of the Holodomor Memorial Complex. Shared memory, shared pain is what unites us and makes us stronger. And the bearers of this memory are people of respectable age. Some will say that it is correct to say ""elderly people"". No! For everything they really did, it is right to say ""people of respectable age."" I am ashamed that we have done too little for them all these years. For some it is just the main electorate, and for me it is people who have given their whole lives for the benefit of Ukraine, for the benefit of our state. Therefore, one of my key priorities is caring for people of respectable age. In particular, we have already implemented a program of additional payments to pensions for people aged 80 and 75. Next year, we will extend this program to people who have reached the age of 70. We clearly comply with our commitment in respect of the annual indexation of pensions. Thus, since March 2021, the pensions of 7.9 million pensioners have been indexed. For the first time in many years, pensions for liquidators and victims of the Chornobyl disaster have been significantly increased. For the first time in all years of independence, we have agreed on the parameters of a reliable mandatory funded pension system, which will allow us to save money for a decent old age. In the near future, the parliament will consider a relevant bill. Dear deputies, especially deputies of respectable age, I count on you. For the first time, we have introduced a comprehensive approach to solving the problems of people who face various barriers. These are people with disabilities from childhood, the amount of care allowance has been increased for them; these are low-income families, for which the amount of benefits has increased by 50% equaling UAH 5,500; these are also children who have suffered from explosive objects - they have been provided with assistance for the first time; these are also people who have suffered from domestic violence - for the first time a subvention has been introduced to create shelters for them; this includes families with children; fathers who for the first time got the right to go on leave to care for newborns. We have increased state aid for children with serious illnesses. All these are features of a country with a European face. Or, more simply, a country with a human face. The same goes for the digital country. Independence is a digital freedom from bureaucracy, queues and corruption. And more than 11 million users of our state application ""Diia"" have already seen this. Ukraine became the first country in the world to introduce a digital passport of a citizen of its state. We've introduced a digital driver's license that allows you to travel or open a bank account online. “Diia” includes a digital student ID, a car insurance, an electronic signature on a smartphone, a digital tax number, payment of taxes and fines and much more. This is not an imaginary metaworld - these are real services that help real citizens in real time. Already today, now, 24/7. And today, a residence registration is added to these functions - that is, the ability to change residence registration online. In the 21st century, people can move freely around the country, regardless of passport stamps. ""Diia"" is first and foremost a social application for all citizens. Now it is not the woman in the office who will be able to assign or transfer the pension to our esteemed people, but the grandson on the sofa. We are already starting the launch of this feature, and ""Diia"" will cover all Ukrainians, regardless of age. Independence is the opportunity to do business independently, honestly and transparently in an independent state. Business opening services in Ukraine will be the fastest in the world. You can already open a sole proprietor in 10 minutes. See and fill out a tax declaration, pay taxes. We are building our own business, independent of the ""wishes"" of officials, which takes into account all the wishes of businessmen. To do this, we will finally launch ""Diia City"", which will allow Ukraine to create the most powerful IT hub in Central and Eastern Europe. Ukrainians and entrepreneurs from all over the world will be able to quickly implement the most ambitious innovative and business ideas and implement them effectively. In five years, ""Diia City"" will help double the size of the IT market - up to $ 11.8 billion, and increase the number of jobs up to 450 thousand. These will be some of the best conditions for running an IT business and creative industry in the world. There are plans to launch important functions soon: an e-census, which will later lead to an e-voting. At the heart of our transformation is the people, and we need to know how many of us are there, where we live. I am proud that Ukraine will be the second country in the world to conduct a census in cooperation with Apple in February 2023. Our goal is that Ukrainians can get 100% of the state's services online - without officials, without queues, without corruption. But the fight against corruption is both a fair and independent court. Judicial reform in Ukraine. There is nothing to be proud of here yet. We are just beginning this difficult path. We only voted for the first two laws. I thank every deputy who supported the laws on the High Council of Justice and the High Qualification Commission of Judges. Thank you. This is not the first time that judicial reform has been launched in Ukraine, but it will be completed for the first time. I thank all the deputies once again for their support of the bills, and I would also like to thank our international partners who support us on this difficult path. Thanks. And this path will be really difficult. For the first time in 30 years, land reform has been fully voted on. I congratulate you! For the first time in 30 years we are starting a full-scale arrangement of the state border around the perimeter of our state. Finally, we passed the law on territorial defense, we approved the Strategy for the deoccupation of Crimea. For the first time in 30 years, we have started a systematic fight against the oligarchs. And I am confident that Ukraine will win this fight. Ukraine will end with this. But I do not want to end my speech with this topic - about the oligarchs. I don't want to talk about small things at the end. I want to say about the main thing: about the state in its true colours, non-expurgated, to speak to you absolutely frankly, honestly, because that's how we were elected, because that's what we were, and I want to believe that we remain so. We must speak openly, in spite of all difficulties, tell the truth as it is, which we could tell or still can, I want to believe that. And then - let's be honest. The war in Donbas has been going on for eight years. Eight years since Russia annexed Crimea. And I'm not afraid to tell that to everyone and tell that directly to Russians. That is why, at the same time, I am not afraid to talk to them directly. We are not afraid of direct dialogue. We know which European countries support Ukraine, it is true, and we thank them. We know which European countries pretend to support Ukraine and our independence. We know that our army is the best in the world and it will protect us. Everyone supports us, but no one but our army will protect us. It's true. And we must admit that without our army we will not be able to stop the war. And we must tell the truth that we will not be able to stop the war without direct talks with Russia. And today it has been recognized by all, all external partners. All external partners have acknowledged that, and some internal partners still do not. We must speak, knowing that we have a strong, powerful army. And we must not be afraid to tell each other the truth now. If we want to return Donbas - let's do so. And if we just want to talk about it, let's do nothing. And let's put an end to this issue, simply and honestly. And let's finally understand - this is our state, let's fight for it, for our territories, by all means, all together with all politicians, regardless of the color of these politicians. And with all businessmen, regardless of their caliber, it's not too late. We are a great country! Glory to each of you! Glory to Ukraine!"
President submits to the Parliament a bill on the economic passport of a Ukrainian,2021-12-01T11:30:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that he was initiating a bill on the economic passport of a Ukrainian, according to which the fee for the use of subsoil would be accumulated on the personal accounts of children of Ukrainian citizens. In his address to the Verkhovna Rada on Ukraine's internal and external situation, the President thanked the deputies for voting on October 30 for a very important tax law that increases the fee for the use of Ukraine's natural resources, which belong to every citizen. ""We will direct these funds to our children. Therefore, by December 10 this year, for the first time in the history of our independence, I will submit (to the Verkhovna Rada - ed.) a bill on the economic passport of Ukrainians.

""We are already urging our citizens to refrain from traveling to countries where a new strain has been detected. It was decided not to allow persons who had been on the territory of certain countries of South Africa for more than 7 days during the last 14 days to enter the territory of Ukraine without undergoing 14 days of self-isolation. In the future, the list of countries may be expanded,"" said Viktor Lyashko.

Address by the President of Ukraine on the occasion of Holodomor Remembrance Day,2021-11-27T16:39:00Z,"Fellow Ukrainians! Dear people! Every year at the end of autumn, we are all united by a difficult date. And this fourth Saturday in November is actually the first for many of us. By the depth of pain and anger at the same time. By the polarity of what we experience this day. From the feeling of loss to the loss of any feelings. On this day, we are full of emotions and devastated at the same time. We light a candle and get cold shivers. On this day we cry so quietly that even our silence can be heard. On this day, we honor the millions of our dead ancestors and pray for the souls of millions of dead Ukrainians. This is Holodomor Remembrance Day. A day when we remember the night. Some of the darkest nights not of the year, not of the decade, but of the whole century in the life of our people. The life that is hard to call life. These are people who were left without a crumb of bread. Parents left without their children. Children left without parents. Generations left without hope. And questions that still remain unanswered. What is the exact number of Ukrainians killed? Will we ever be able to determine it? What truth do we still not know? Will we ever be able to discover it? How could the government live with all this and conceal crimes for years, decades? Will we ever be able to forget about them? We know the answer to this question - no. We will never forget our ancestors who died in 1921, 1922 and 1923. In 1946 and 1947. And in the worst 1932 and 1933, arranged by the totalitarian Stalinist regime, the years of the Holodomor-genocide. We have actually completed the reconstruction of the first stage of the Holodomor Museum. Next year marks the 90th anniversary of this terrible tragedy. And by this date we must build the second stage of the historically important museum. I signed a corresponding decree on this and a number of other measures. And it's not just a matter of duty, respect or honor. This is a question of our existence. Because as soon as the memory of millions of dead and unborn Ukrainians disappears, we will disappear ourselves. We will die ourselves. As a nation, as a society, as a state. As people. We still do not know the names of many Ukrainians who died from the Holodomor. It destroyed entire families, streets, villages. So there is no one to ask. But it could not destroy us completely. So there is someone to remember. And there is someone to pass the memory to the next generations. About the fact that the horror called “Holodomor” has not been described by any dictionary before. Because no ruler has ever been able to invent such an atrocity before. We as a nation have survived this horror. The key word is “survived”. And we won. And the innocent victims of the Holodomor are tortured, murdered, but not forgotten! May their souls rest in peace! May the memory of them all live forever!"

The war, which has been going on for eight years,"" the President added. The President also noted that he would like to see practical steps to ensure the energy security of Ukraine and Europe.

"Russia is trying to de-actualize the Normandy format, but Ukraine will continue to look for the ways to end the war in Donbas through diplomacy",2021-11-26T17:38:00Z,"The Russian Federation is trying to divert the international community's attention from the issue of ending the war in Donbas with the help of hybrid steps, but Ukraine has received assurances from allies that they remain on our side, said President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a press marathon “30 questions to the President of Ukraine”. ""There is a Normandy format. The French side wants to put further pressure on Russia to hold a meeting of the ""Normandy Four"" with the new Chancellor of Germany. And in parallel, we expect negotiations between the United States and the Russian Federation. Without Ukraine, a decision on Ukraine will not be made, but one of the most important issues of these talks will still be Ukraine,"" the President said. At the same time, Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that from the very beginning of his presidency he had been looking for other formats of negotiations on ending the war in Donbas, parallel to Normandy and Minsk. ""We started it in advance (negotiation process - ed.). And now it is in progress. We will see whether the result of the diplomatic path will be achieved with the involvement of the United States,"" he said. As for the negotiations in the Normandy format, according to the President, Russia is now using powerful hybrid means to make the situation in Ukraine lose relevance for the world leaders. ""Like, wait with Normandy, with this Ukraine, here's energy, here's the immigration crisis in Belarus,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Nevertheless, Ukraine has publicly and privately received assurances from allies - the United States, Canada, Great Britain, the EU, Turkey - that they will remain on the side of our state and will support us in the event of escalation.

"President: Big business should not ""buy"" deputies, distort information in their media and force employees to vote for a certain candidate",2021-11-26T16:02:00Z,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy states that he does not intend to fight big business in Ukraine, but the oligarchs should not blackmail society and the Ukrainian people. He stated this during a press marathon ""30 questions to the President of Ukraine"". ""We live in a free country, and you should not influence people's opinion because you have something. For example, you have control over a large number of people due to a large number of enterprises, but you cannot tell them to vote for this or that person and give them a salary for that or delay the payment of this salary,” the President said. The President stressed that big business has no right to ""buy"" people's deputies.

""You have no right to blackmail society, to blackmail the people of Ukraine,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, referring to the influence of oligarchs on political processes in the country. At the same time, he noted that there are many big businessmen in Ukraine who do not seek to influence politics. In his opinion, business representatives should talk to the state about certain incentives for the development of their enterprises and industries in general. ""Create jobs - the state is very interested in that. Because it is very difficult to attract international investments in the country, but there are domestic investments, there is money, it is necessary to reinvest it,"" the President said."
Regarding the appointment of judges of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine under the President's quota,2021-11-26T15:45:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy has fulfilled his constitutional duty and appointed two judges to the Constitutional Court of Ukraine to the relevant positions, which have remained vacant since March this year. Candidates were selected through an open and transparent competition.  22 domestic lawyers, including OSCE experts, judges, CEC members, academic scholars, lawyers, etc., expressed their desire to take part in the competition. Seven of them were defined by the competition commission as the most worthy and professional. Based on the results of interviews conducted with these candidates, Volodymyr Zelenskyy identified two of the most professional among them: The relevant presidential decrees were signed on November 26, 2021. Thanks to the President's decision and a competitive procedure, which can't be doubted, Ukraine overcame the constitutional crisis provoked by the Constitutional Court's decision of October 27, 2020, which threatened the entire system of anti-corruption institutions and the country's European future. On that day, the Constitutional Court declared certain provisions of the anti-corruption legislation of Ukraine unconstitutional, among other things, abolished criminal liability for inaccurate declaration and inclusion of knowingly inaccurate information in the declaration. The content of this decision, the nature of its adoption, the arguments and internal motives of individual judges of the then Constitutional Court caused fair indignation not only of Ukrainians, but also of representatives of international institutions and partner states of Ukraine. ""We were simply confronted with the fact that several people related to Yanukovych could adopt a decision in violation of all possible rules, which destroys Ukraine's achievements over decades,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Together with the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, a mechanism was developed to restore the system of declaration and return real responsibility for lies and manipulation in the declarations of officials and deputies. The President signed laws passed by the Parliament to restore the anti-corruption system and the powers of the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption to verify declarations and monitor the lifestyles of those concerned, taking into account the peculiarities of the procedure for judges and judges of the Constitutional Court. ""Legally and politically, we have removed any threats to the anti-corruption system. The question of the functioning of the Constitutional Court remained. Functioning in accordance with the Constitution, not in the interests of individuals who for some reason believed that the Constitutional Court was their property. The state has resolved this issue as well,"" the President stressed. At a meeting of the National Security and Defense Council on March 19, 2021, among other things, a decision was made to audit all of Viktor Yanukovych's decrees. After a corresponding inspection and execution of this decision, on March 27, 2021, Viktor Yanukovych's decrees of May 14, 2013 ""On the appointment of O. Tupytsky as a judge of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine"" and September 17, 2013 ""On the appointment of O. Kasminin as a judge of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine"" were revoked. Thus, as of today, judges of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine appointed by the President of Ukraine are appointed and may perform their duties in accordance with the Basic Law."
President: Judicial reform will definitely be completed,2021-11-26T15:10:00Z,"Judicial reform in Ukraine will definitely be completed, but it is a long and difficult process, said President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during the press marathon ""30 questions to the President of Ukraine"". The President stressed that the implementation of this reform is supported by the Office of the President of Ukraine. And on the initiative of the President, the Verkhovna Rada has already adopted fundamental laws on the work of the High Qualification Commission of Judges (HQCJ) and the High Council of Justice (HCJ). ""This is my initiative, and you know very well that the Servant of the People party and some other deputies of some groups voted for these laws. The majority answered the voting question. Then they (these laws - ed.) must be implemented,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

I fully support that,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy summed up."

He stated this during a press marathon ""30 questions to the President of Ukraine"". ""I will not fight for power - I am fighting for Ukraine, no matter how pompously it may sound. As for some forceful pressure on me to resign, if that happens, you will see the exact opposite effect. Then there will be an answer, and I will fight to the last, as it was the first time I ran for the presidency,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. He added that as President he seeks to build Ukraine's infrastructure, work to end the war and establish peace in Donbas, and help overcome many other challenges.

The President noted that this decision will depend not on the format of the parliamentary coalition after the upcoming elections to the Verkhovna Rada, but on the support of his personality by the Ukrainian people, as well as on the opinion of his family."
Operation to detain Wagner militants was not thought out in detail - Head of State,2021-11-26T14:19:00Z,"The operation to detain the militants of the Wagner private military company was unprofessionally prepared and could have provoked numerous casualties. This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a press marathon ""30 questions to the President of Ukraine"". The Head of State noted that he had talked to the head of the special operation to detain the militants, and he had admitted the possibility of the Turkish plane being hijacked by members of the PMC. ""I had a feeling that we were being drawn into it (the operation - ed.). And I say that I want to know: the Turkish Airlines plane, which departs from Minsk, will have ordinary people on board, Turkish citizens and others - more than a hundred people,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The Head of State stressed that the possible casualties among the passengers of the Turkish Airlines plane would have caused indignation of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and, as a result, the deterioration of relations between Ukraine and Turkey. ""I said it was not our operation, it was not thought out in detail. I am ready to accept any operation, even this one, if things are calculated in detail and if people are not injured,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy added. He also noted that Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak could not approve the decision on the operation to detain Wagner militants, as he did not have such powers."
"The possibility of escalation on the part of Russia is constant, and Ukraine is ready for it - Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2021-11-26T13:55:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that the possibility of escalation by Russia and the illegal armed groups supported by it has been constant for many years, and Ukraine is fully prepared for it, but now Ukrainian citizens are being deliberately intimidated by certain forces and media resources under their control. ""We have been at war for eight years. And the likelihood of large-scale or continuation of a strong escalation by Russia or militants backed by the Russian Federation may take place any day. But I think that today there is intimidation from some sites and media that there will be a war tomorrow,"" the President said during a press marathon""30 questions to the President of Ukraine"". Volodymyr Zelenskyy assured that Ukraine fully controls its state borders and is fully prepared for any escalation. The President stressed that our state can always count on its powerful army, which is being modernized, receiving new equipment and increased military's financial support. ""We receive intelligence data on a daily basis. And not only from our intelligence service, but also from the intelligence of partner countries that support us,"" he said. According to the President, foreign leaders are trying to help in the negotiations between Ukraine and the Russian Federation.

I think that in the near future Yermak (Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak - ed.) will contact them,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. At the same time, the Head of State noted that Ukraine faces challenges not only from Russia, but also internal challenges. In particular, he noted that he had received information about the intention to organize a coup d'état in the country.

"President: Infrastructure reform is the biggest and most successful in recent decades, and we are moving forward",2021-11-26T13:40:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that during his term in office a number of important reforms have already been successfully implemented, and some of the changes have begun, and they are in the process of implementation. The Head of State said this during a press marathon ""30 questions to the President of Ukraine"" dedicated to the equator of his term. In particular, according to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, land and banking reforms have been launched, and the modernization of infrastructure is noted not only in Ukraine, but also in the world. ""Today, infrastructure reform is the largest and most successful in 50 years. I think this is a great progress. We measure progress in building a country in thousands of kilometers of roads. Not in one bridge, when we are proud that, for example, a bridge is being built in Zaporizhzhia. 150 bridges are already being built,” the President said. The Head of State also reminded that the Ukrainian national air carrier had recently been launched. Judicial reform continues. In addition, as Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized, de-oligarchization continues in Ukraine, one of the signs of which is the achievement of profitability of Ukrzaliznytsia JSC, state ports and Boryspil International Airport. ""This is de-oligarchization, because we understand what kind of people were everywhere - not just representatives of the oligarchs, but some former officials and some former employees. Their “tentacles” are in everything that belongs to the state of Ukraine, the people of Ukraine. And today we have these areas profitable,"" the President stressed. ""I respect big business in terms of jobs, but it is very important that big business is not oligarchic and does not influence the media and politicians,"" he added. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also noted that due to the COVID-19 pandemic and energy challenges, society pays little attention to important victories in other areas, and as President he does not always have enough time to explain everything. ""I make 100 decisions every day. I don't have time to communicate all my decisions with the public, I don't have my media in my ""wallet"" for someone to help communicate it. But there is a result,"" the Head of State stressed. At the same time, the President emphasized that Ukrainians use new roads, citizens are provided with vaccines, there are beds with oxygen in renovated hospitals, and so on."

The issue of support for Ukraine has received a prominent place in the new coalition agreement of the future German government - Ihor Zhovkva,2021-11-25T17:24:00Z,"Significant attention was paid to the issue of support for Ukraine in the text of the coalition agreement, which was presented by the Social Democratic Party, the Green Party and the Free Democratic Party of Germany, said Deputy Head of the President's Office Ihor Zhovkva. ""In Ukraine, not only has this process been closely monitored, but in recent months we have also been actively working with key representatives of these political forces. After all, the continuity of Germany's support for Ukraine is of key importance to us. Germany has traditionally played a leading role both in the peace process in Donbas and in shaping the EU's position on Ukraine. And it is also a strategic partner for Ukraine,"" said the Deputy Head of the Office of the President. Ihor Zhovkva stressed that due to systematic work with the German political elite, we managed to include a number of important provisions in support of our state in the text of the coalition agreement. ""First of all, it is the support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our state. Coalition partners demand that Russia stop the destabilization of Ukraine and illegal annexation of Crimea, as well as ensure the implementation of the Minsk agreements, to which sanctions against Russia are tied,” the Deputy Head of the Office of the President stressed. Important attention in the coalition agreement is also paid to the deepening of the energy partnership with Ukraine, in particular in the issues of renewable energy sources, production of ""green"" hydrogen and increase of energy efficiency. Although the text does not explicitly mention Nord Stream 2, the agreement also contains a clear provision on the application of European energy legislation to energy political projects. ""It is worth paying attention to the use of the term ""political"" to make it clear what kind of project is implied,"" said Ihor Zhovkva. The Deputy Head of the Office of the President stressed that the text of the coalition agreement contains provisions to support Ukraine's European integration aspirations. In particular, the aspirations of our state to become a member of the European Union are clearly recognized. In addition, Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova are mentioned in the context of the Eastern Partnership initiative, so the Associated Trio initiative launched by the three countries has become a new reality in the Eastern European region. ""On the basis of these provisions, we will continue to work both in the context of preparations for the Eastern Partnership Summit scheduled for December and with a view to signing, I hope, in the near future a bilateral declaration with Germany recognizing Ukraine's European aspirations,"" said Ihor Zhovkva. The Deputy Head of the Office of the President stressed that Ukraine looks forward to the completion of the formation of a new German government in order to start cooperation in many areas of the broad agenda."

""I have always said that we really need projects that sew our country together. Both metaphorically and literally - practically, project-wise,"" said the President, noting that the aircraft construction has once become one of the most important projects of the European Union. ""Today is an important day - we return the idea of a European aircraft to the world. Now it is our Ukrainian dream, shared with colleagues from Europe. Ukraine has a beautiful ""Antonov"", all production facilities for the full cycle of creation of a modern aircraft. It's not easy, but we are already doing it. This is both cargo planes and government orders. This year three planes are being built for our state. We have all the facilities for serial production, up to providing comprehensive after-sales support,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. At the same time, according to the President, negotiations are underway with Western partners on the creation of a modern air hub in Ukraine for the modernization of passenger planes into cargo ones.

We are ready to invest in the air fleet, provide orders for Ukrainian manufacturers and involve world leaders in joint projects in aircraft construction,"" the President stressed. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the working title of the future company is Ukrainian National Airlines (UNA, ""Ukrainian National Airlines""). There is already confirmation of the economic feasibility of this project from French consultants.

We are sewing our state together,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. He also recalled the main event of this year - the signing of the open skies agreement with the European Union, which is often called the second visa-free regime. ""The Common Aviation Area Agreement with Ukraine is unique, as the European Union does not have aviation agreements with any country in the world on such terms. In particular, Ukraine retains its powers as a state - manufacturer of aircraft. This is very important for our domestic brand ""Antonov"", the relevant certification powers are also retained in Ukraine,"" said the President. ""The launch of a national carrier, new modern airports - this is not a question of isolated cases, this is a dozen new modern airports - this is a big step forward. The transformation of Boryspil International Airport into the most powerful Eastern European aircraft hub, the revival of our modern Ukrainian aircraft construction and the strengthening of industrial cooperation in the Ukraine - European Union format are the main goals for us, for the Ministry, for ""Large Construction"". Obviously - ambitious, of course - difficult, but I'm sure - feasible,"" said the President."

Address by the President of Ukraine on the occasion of the Day of Dignity and Freedom,2021-11-21T09:00:00Z,"Fellow Ukrainians! There are about five thousand peoples on our planet. Their portrait, archetype, mentality is a confusing web of historical events for ethnographers. But there is one thing that, in my opinion, simply yet accurately depicts the character of the people. This is his national holidays. What unites everyone is important to everyone. November 21 is just such a day. The answer to the questions: who are Ukrainians and what is most important for them? Today we celebrate the Day of Dignity and Freedom. A holiday that shows that dignity and freedom is a holiday for us. This is our air. No. It doesn't sound too loud. When someone decides to restrain us, that's when it's too loud. When the authorities do not hear the Ukrainian people, then it is too loud. That is why we are free. Free to create the future. And we should be proud of that. We shouldn't act superior. But we should not lower our eyes as well. Yes. We have paid and continue to pay a high price for freedom. And we will never forget all those who gave their lives for Ukraine. And we will never forgive all those who took their lives and wanted to deprive us of our freedom. But the main thing is that they didn’t succeed and will never succeed. And it's time to change self-perception and thinking. We are not victims, we are not oppressed, we are not divided, we are not captured. We are beautiful, strong, brave, smart, talented people. Invincible. Precisely because we have dignity. For us, slavery is a humiliation. Loss of freedom is a loss of honor. Loss of honor is a loss of the heart. Loss of the heart is a loss of the soul. And loss of the soul for us is a loss of life. That is why we are ready to fight at the cost of our own lives. In order not to lose our life. For us, dignity and freedom have long gone beyond common understanding. I will never forget the story our sailors told when they returned home. They were in captivity, but they were not captivated by the spirit. Investigators asked them to laugh a little quieter: ""The authorities will not understand"". People usually cry here, and our sailors laugh incessantly. They sat in a paddy wagon, sang the national anthem and then told the driver: ""Boss, to Odesa! In Koblevo, let’s have a break and get some coffee."" They did not behave like captives. And they remained officers and soldiers. Because they have not lost their dignity. And they proved that in a foreign land, in captivity, in prison, you can be a free person. Because freedom is not the absence of handcuffs. This is the absence of prison in their heads. Vasyl Stus knew this for sure. When a wave of arrests of creative youth swept through Ukraine, at the premiere of Parajanov's “Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors”, he stood up and said: ""Everyone who opposes arrests, stand up."" A few people got up, then more, then more. Not all. But he was not alone. Stus knew that by doing so, he could lose his freedom. But he knew that if he didn't, he would definitely lose his dignity. Omelyan Kovch also knew this. A priest who rescued Jews in the Holocaust by giving them baptismal records. For this he was sent to the Majdanek concentration camp. And in order not to lose dignity, he was forced to lose his freedom forever. In the letter, he apologized to his children for not agreeing to early release and staying there. ""These people need me here. Feeling that they will soon die, they all come to me for confession. If I go, they will be left without hope. They have already been deprived of dignity, honor, freedom, home, relatives, names, they will soon be deprived of their lives. I will not allow taking away their hope."" Leonid Bykov did not give up principles and creative freedom. For this, for the filming of the ""Only ""Old Men"" Are Going Into Battle"" he was given not a color but a black-and-white film. Did this damage his dignity? Maybe. But did he lose it? No. And he made a film that is adored by millions. Not colored. But about people who have dignity. And freedom. Like everyone who stood on Maidan, on the barricades, on the granite. In 1990, in 2004 and 2014. Like those who then met in the trenches in the east of our state, defending it. All. Different. The guys from the West, and the guys from the Southeast. Speaking different languages. Residents of Volyn, Odesa, Galicia, Dnipro, Zakarpattia, Bukovyna. With the cross, with the crescent, with the star of David. From Kharkiv, from Ternopil, from Kryvyi Rih, from Ivano-Frankivsk. Cherkasy, Vinnytsia, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kherson, Khmelnytskyi, Zaporizhzhia. From Kyiv. From Donbas, from the Luhansk region, from Crimea. All. Different. But Ukrainians. Defenders. Everyone who knows: you have to be worthy, not give up. Because Ukrainians are not used to giving up. Because they have dignity. And therefore - freedom! Glory to Ukraine!"

It is a US initiative to build a community of allies and partners to improve the ability to detect, synchronize and jointly respond to simulated malicious actions in cyberspace targeting critical infrastructure and key resources.

In August this year, the President signed Decrees № 447/2021 and № 446/2021, which approved the Cyber Security Strategy of Ukraine and the decision to establish cyber troops in the Ministry of Defense, respectively. With the growing level of asymmetric, hybrid, in particular cyber threats, as well as their cross-border nature, the participation of domestic experts in Cyber Flag 21 reflects the intention not only to join the best world practices, but also to contribute to cybersecurity. In addition, participation in the event is another step towards the Euro-Atlantic integration of our country, enshrined in the Constitution."

Instead, you can make a few clicks in the Diia app. Comfortable conditions for doing business, transparency, and access to information are among the priorities of my work,"" the Head of State said. It will also be possible to automatically check the information provided by companies against the data of state registers, which will replace the long-term reconciliation of paper documents with electronic registers in manual mode and significantly speed up the registration process. The draft law also provides for the preparation and approval by the responsible authority of a detailed methodology for determining the ultimate beneficiary for legal entities and carrying out explanatory work in this regard. It is proposed that legal entities have at least six months to submit information from the date of approval of such a methodology, and those who have already submitted information have the opportunity to clarify it. These innovations were adopted in compliance with the norms of the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union, as well as with the aim of implementing the standards of the Financial Action Task Force in the legislation of Ukraine and harmonization of national legislation with EU legislation. The draft law initiated by the President envisages the implementation of all international obligations of Ukraine and the maximum simplification of the process of submitting information by Ukrainian companies and its further processing."

President: The next important direction of the Large Construction - the new Ukrainian railway - starts today,2021-11-09T14:50:00Z,"Renewal of the railway, modernization of rolling stock and railways will be the next important area of the Large Construction National Program. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a speech at the ""Large Construction: A New Railway"" Forum. The Head of State noted that two years ago, in the framework of the ""Large Construction"" program, construction and repair of thousands of kilometers of roads began in all regions of Ukraine. Then the construction and reconstruction of hundreds of schools, kindergartens and hospitals began, then - sports complexes, stadiums and swimming pools, regional airports, castles, cathedrals and museums. ""Today we present a new ""next"". The next, very important direction - the new Ukrainian railway - begins. For years, the railway has been destroyed by ""corrosion"": bad management and corruption. Like rust, it was covered with opacity and inefficiency. Because of that it has become accordingly not cheap, inconvenient and even dangerous. The condition to which our railway has been brought over the years can be briefly but aptly described as follows: a prehistoric locomotive that barely pulls a train with creaking carriages on worn-out tracks to dirty stations and uncomfortable stations,” the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that in the summer, after intervening in the situation by the National Security and Defense Council, the state managed to regain control of Ukrzaliznytsia. ""We can already see the first important positive results. For the first time in 12 months, Ukrzaliznytsia has become profitable. For the first time in a long time, the cost of freight transportation has increased; understated tariffs in favor of big business remained in the past. Instead, there are an additional 2 billion hryvnias that Ukrzaliznytsia has received this year, and more than 12 billion hryvnias that the company will definitely receive next year,” the President said. Also, according to him, conditions have been created for Ukrzaliznytsia to buy electricity directly from the state supplier, not through bogus companies, and thus save UAH 4 billion. In addition, cooperation was resumed with a key national enterprise in the field of car building - Kryukov plant, which today presented new diesel trains. Ukrzaliznytsia will receive three of them by the end of the year. ""Also this year, Ukrzaliznytsia will receive 20 new sleeping cars - the first of the announced hundred.

Roman Mashovets informed Tobias Thyberg about the complication of the situation in eastern Ukraine and the concentration of an armed group along the Ukrainian border ready to be used by the Russian Federation against our state at any moment. He focused on Russia's holding of a series of exercises against Ukraine this year, the asymmetry of Russia's actions and its use of Belarusian territory to possibly expand aggression.

The Normandy format is the only platform for negotiations on a peaceful settlement in Donbas: Press Secretary of the President,2021-11-08T18:30:00Z,"The Normandy format is the only platform for negotiations on a peaceful settlement in eastern Ukraine, and the responsibility for delaying the progress of the negotiation process lies with the Russian party. This was emphasized by Press Secretary of the President of Ukraine Serhiy Nykyforov in a video commentary. ""The Russian party remains solely responsible for the delay in the Normandy format. Ukraine, France and Germany are ready for contacts at the level of ministers and leaders in the near future. We believe that the essence of the negotiations is to get a result. If the Russian party insists that the outcome should be known before the start of negotiations, it calls into question the negotiation process itself. We call on Moscow to cooperate. Donbas is waiting for peace, and Russia must make a contribution to its achievement,"" Serhiy Nykyforov said. The President's Press Secretary also informed that after the appointment of Oleksiy Reznikov to the post of Minister of Defense, Iryna Vereshchuk, who was appointed Minister for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories of Ukraine, will join the Ukrainian delegation in the Trilateral Contact Group. MP Andriy Kostin will temporarily act as the first deputy head of the Ukrainian delegation to the TCG. According to Serhiy Nykyforov, the Ukrainian delegation to the Trilateral Contact Group should focus even more on resolving humanitarian and social issues. ""The Office of the President emphasizes the need to intensify work on the release of detainees, ensure normal working conditions of the checkpoints on the touch line. It is also necessary to create a new subgroup that will work to return control over the state border in Donbas to Ukraine. If the Russian party recognizes the Minsk agreements, it must also agree to implement the ""Minsk"" points at the level of the TCG,” said the President's Press Secretary. Serhiy Nykyforov noted that the Russian Federation has long kept specific groups of troops near Ukraine's borders, and Ukrainian special services and Ukraine's international partners are working on this issue. ""There is a kind of ongoing reinforcement. Such changes have become the cause of concern for our partners, which resulted in the publications of Western media. But it is too early to draw conclusions about Russia's specific goals and possible developments at the border. The key thing is that Ukraine and our partners carry out full and prompt communication at various levels, and we are ready to respond to any scenarios,"" the President's Press Secretary summed up."
"Despite the difficult situation with the spread of COVID-19, the rate of hospitalizations in Ukraine is being stabilized - conference call with the President",2021-11-08T15:48:00Z,"The situation with the spread of COVID-19 in Ukraine, the course of vaccination, the provision of hospitals with oxygen and business support during the ""red"" level of epidemic danger were discussed at a conference call chaired by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. According to Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, the trend of increasing the number of patients with COVID-19 continues: last week at the peak of the incidence, 27.3 thousand new cases were detected per day, and the total number of new patients remains at the level of 152 thousand people for two weeks in a row. However, according to the head of government, we can talk about some stabilization in terms of hospitalizations: 34.5 thousand last week and 34.3 thousand - a week earlier. Currently, 17 regions of Ukraine are in the ""red"" zone of epidemic danger. In the Kherson region, the dynamics is somewhat improving, which may allow the region to be one of the first to leave the ""red"" zone. At the same time, it was stated that the number of patients with coronavirus in Kyiv is growing. Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksiy Danilov emphasized the need to ensure a stable supply of oxygen to the capital's hospitals. Denys Shmyhal also reminded that government decree № 1096 came into force today, according to which representatives of certain professions, including teachers and civil servants, should be suspended from work unless they are vaccinated. Schools now employ, in particular offline, only vaccinated teachers. Minister of Health Viktor Lyashko reported to the President on the course of vaccination of the population. According to him, a total of 11.5 million people in Ukraine have already been vaccinated, including 8 million people who received two doses. However, this weekend a decrease in the number of vaccinations was recorded in a number of regions, including Zhytomyr and Odesa. An investigation is currently underway to determine why individual vaccination points did not operate in these regions. Viktor Lyashko said that on Sunday Ukraine received another 3 million doses of Moderna vaccine within the COVAX initiative. The Minister of Health reiterated the importance of vaccination, as more than 95% of those hospitalized with COVID-19 were not vaccinated. Such citizens have a more severe course of the disease and, unfortunately, a higher percentage of deaths is recorded among them due to complications. Therefore, the issue of vaccination is still relevant, said Viktor Lyashko. He added that Ukraine is currently experiencing the peak of the pandemic, which many countries have already passed, and this causes high mortality rates among patients with coronavirus. The Minister also assured that there is no oxygen deficiency in medical institutions treating patients with COVID-19. Despite the high level of consumption, oxygen is steadily supplied to all hospitals. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed the need to support businesses operating in the ""red"" zones. The Ministry of Economy of Ukraine is preparing a relevant bill, and it will be submitted to the Verkhovna Rada in the near future. Law enforcement bodies continue to combat the falsification of PCR tests and vaccination certificates. Currently, there are 1,400 mobile teams of the National Police of Ukraine, which check the availability of these documents in institutions visited en masse by citizens: shopping and entertainment centers, cafes, restaurants and public transport. All facts of violations are recorded and have appropriate legal consequences."
President: We will never forget the price at which Kyiv was liberated from the Nazi invaders,2021-11-06T12:11:00Z,"On the 78th anniversary of the liberation of Kyiv from the Nazi invaders, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy laid flowers in the memorial hall of the Monument - Museum of the Liberation of Kyiv, located on the territory of the National Museum-Reserve ""Battle for Kyiv in 1943"" in the village of Novi Petrivtsi, Kyiv region.

But according to a number of historians, the total death toll is at least twice as high, as those mobilized through field military enlistment offices were often not registered, so as not to worsen death toll statistics. ""Even not dressed in uniform and extremely poorly armed, hundreds of thousands of our ancestors were thrown into the battle for the liberation of Kyiv. To certain death. We will never forget the price at which the capital of Ukraine was liberated from the Nazi occupiers on November 6, 1943,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed.

In this regard, the interlocutors paid considerable attention to the role that the Council of Europe should play in the protection of human rights in the temporarily occupied Crimea and Donbas. ""I am confident that the activities of your organization in this extremely important direction for us will only intensify,"" said the President of Ukraine. The practical modalities of involving the Secretary General of the Council of Europe in monitoring the human rights situation in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine in accordance with the norms of international law and national legislation of our state were discussed separately. The President stressed that the Ukrainian side is waiting for the first report of Marija Pejčinović Burić on the human rights situation in the temporarily occupied Crimea and is ready to cooperate in this important area. ""I am convinced that your visit to the administrative border with the Autonomous Republic of Crimea has provided a deeper understanding of the importance of this issue and will help in the preparation of the report,"" the President said.

In this regard, the President informed the Secretary General of the Council of Europe about the signing of the anti-oligarchic law passed by the Verkhovna Rada. As agreed between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Gianni Buquicchio, President of the European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission), the text of the law signed by the President will be submitted to the commission for consideration and preparation of an opinion."
President immediately signed the anti-oligarchic law passed by the Verkhovna Rada,2021-11-05T15:39:00Z,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy immediately signed Law № 1780-IX adopted by the Verkhovna Rada “On Prevention of Threats to National Security Related to Excessive Influence of Persons Who Have Significant Economic and Political Weight in Public Life (Oligarchs)”. The document was developed to fulfill the key task of state policy, namely: ensuring the real transformation of the state in the interests of society as a whole and the implementation of Ukraine's strategic course towards European and Euro-Atlantic integration. ""In all successful European countries, there is no branch of government like the oligarchs. States there work in the interests of their citizens, not a handful of the richest. It is such changes in Ukraine that our citizens voted for in 2019,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The anti-oligarchic law provides a legal framework for separating big business from political struggle and for limiting the destructive influence of privileged (oligarchic) interests on the economic life of Ukraine. There are clear criteria for identifying oligarchs and requirements for transparent contacts of politicians and officials with oligarchs or their representatives. In particular, a person who has significant economic and political weight in public life (oligarch) will be considered a natural person who simultaneously meets at least three of the following characteristics: 1) participates in political life; 2) has a significant impact on the media; 3) is the ultimate beneficial owner of an economic entity, which after the date of entry into force of this Law is a subject of natural monopolies or occupies a monopoly (dominant) position in the market in accordance with the Law of Ukraine ""On Protection of Economic Competition"" and maintains or aggravates such a situation for a year; 4) the confirmed value of the assets of the person and business entities of which he is the beneficiary exceeds 1 million subsistence minimums established for able-bodied persons on January 1 of the respective year. The obligation to file a declaration of contacts with the oligarchs or their representatives will apply to all officials on whose decisions the fate of society or government decisions depend. The law gives big business enough time to adapt and abandon the practices of the old oligarchic system. After the publication of the document, the 6-month period begins for the full implementation of its norms. ""Big business is present in any democracy. But no matter how big a businessman is, he must work according to the law and on an equal footing with other economic entities. If someone is used to buying politicians to allow them to circumvent the law, then even the richest will have to say goodbye to this habit,” the President stressed. The Head of State reminded that the adoption of the anti-oligarchic law was opposed by dozens of influential people who depend on the oligarchs. ""There was resistance. Then there will be even more resistance from those who have earned billions from the state. But there can be no other option but to dismantle the oligarchic system. Without this, it is simply impossible to overcome poverty in Ukraine and fully join the European community,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The document was sent for official publication."

"President: Community safety begins where the street is lit at night, where people are not afraid to turn to the police",2021-11-04T13:22:00Z,"The Ukrainian state, together with local authorities and territorial communities, must create a safe environment for every Ukrainian. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a speech at the All-Ukrainian Forum ""Ukraine 30. Safe Community"" in Kyiv. The Head of State noted that the issue of ensuring the security of Ukrainians is more relevant than ever, and today at the forum it will be considered for the first time in the context of the role and place of the territorial community in this process. The President stressed that every resident of the community has the right to protection of his or her life, health and property from criminal encroachments, civil protection, prevention and elimination of the consequences of emergencies, natural disasters, fires, quality and affordable administrative services. ""Community safety begins where there is light on the street at night, where there are no potholes on the roads, where people are not afraid to turn to a police officer for help, because they know him personally, because they trust this person,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “Community safety begins where the local volunteer fire brigade, which has all the necessary tools and professional equipment, works in a coordinated and fast manner. Where the protection of children, women and the elderly from domestic violence is not only a matter of the police, but also a social problem. Where it is possible to use a helicopter to provide emergency medical care in any part of our large country, to quickly evacuate the injured or sick to the hospital. These are simple, at first glance, things, but complex, in my opinion, we should talk about today,"" he added. According to the President, the state and local authorities, together with the concerned community, must create a safe environment for the life of each resident, ""so that these issues are addressed directly by those people who live in a particular region."" ""Security begins with each of us. Today, exclusively those who support this approach are in this room: those who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 ensure not only their own safety, but also the safety of those around them. I really urge you to convey this to every resident of every territorial community who has elected you and who trusts you,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. For his part, Minister of the Interior Denys Monastyrskyi noted that communication between law enforcement agencies and local communities is very important in ensuring the safety of citizens. In order to improve cooperation, communication chats will be created, in which the heads of territorial communities will be able to communicate directly with the leadership of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and representatives of the National Police and the State Emergency Service of Ukraine on the ground. In addition, according to the Interior Minister, it is planned to triple the number of community police officers from next year (up to 2,000). According to him, 3,554 people died on the roads of Ukraine last year alone. Therefore, in order to improve road safety, complexes for auto-recording violations should actively be installed. Among the priorities is the full provision of patrol police officers with chest cameras (video recorders), as most conflicts take place on the roads. ""Starting next year, there will be a body camera in every patrol police unit, and police officers will be obliged to turn it on when communicating with citizens. Thus, we are convinced that we will be able to achieve higher standards of protection of rights,"" said Denys Monastyrskyi. As part of the implementation of the barrier-free policy, police officers already use the application, which allows them to communicate with people with speech and hearing impairments. The security area should be the school and other institutions where children study. To this end, the President initiated the Security Educator project. According to Denys Monastyrskyi, this will be the person who will coordinate security issues in each school and work closely with the police and civil defense agencies. ""Because if we allow offenses there, if we allow the spread of drugs, bullying and so on, citizens who then violate public order and are a threat to society will grow up from there,"" the minister said."

Presenting Oleksiy Reznikov's candidacy for the post of Defense Minister in the session hall of the parliament, Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed confidence that the new minister, like his predecessor, would work to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities. ""Today, the most important thing for the Minister of Defense is to be in the ""hall of glory"" of Ukrainian fighters - that is, to enjoy unquestioning respect and high authority among them. To strengthen the defense capabilities of our army. What is important is to provide decent conditions for our defenders of Ukraine,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The President also thanked Andriy Taran for his work as Minister of Defense of Ukraine and called on people's deputies to support Oleksiy Reznikov's candidacy. Addressing the MPs, Oleksiy Reznikov noted that the Ministry of Defense, a civilian agency, should shape the policy and vision of the army and create conditions for the Armed Forces of Ukraine to effectively repel the enemy. ""The war with Russia has been lasting for eight years. The hybrid nature of the conflict, the military potential of the occupying power and the security situation in the world require Ukraine's response to these challenges to be comprehensive and adaptive. The price of escalation should be unacceptable for the aggressor, and the cost of temporary occupation of our territories should constantly increase for them,"" Oleksiy Reznikov stressed. He also outlined the main directions of his work in the new position. In particular, ensuring synergies in the activities of the Ministry of Defense, the General Staff and the profile committee of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. The Ministry of Defense should also work closely with the Ministry of Strategic Industries. ""Together, we must gradually change the structure of the defense budget so that it is the budget of a modern combat-ready army,"" he said. In addition, Oleksiy Reznikov stressed the priority of expanding strategic cooperation with NATO and the United States. There is a significant potential for deepening cooperation with Great Britain, Canada, Poland, Turkey and the Baltic States. ""In the framework of strategic relations with the United States, the agreements established during the visit of the President of Ukraine to Washington should be filled with content,"" Oleksiy Reznikov said. He called another priority a change in the approach to personnel policy in the army and the transformation of the Armed Forces into a powerful employer that competes for the best staff and cares for people from the beginning of choosing a profession to the adaptation after service. The next direction, according to Oleksiy Reznikov, is to improve the quality of management. ""My first step will be a full audit of the Ministry, analysis of internal processes and document management. ""The Ukrainian ""paper"" army must remain in the past,"" he stressed. According to Oleksiy Reznikov, special attention will be paid to the organization of defense procurement, as well as to the completion of the division of powers between the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces. ""A strong army is one of the most powerful diplomatic arguments in the peace process. If we want peace, if we want to return Crimea, the occupied territories of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, we need to increase the country's defense capabilities and resilience,"" he stressed. ""The results of the Ministry's activities affect the entire sector and the resilience of the country as a whole. Therefore, I consider the submission for this position as a great honor and at the same time I understand the full weight of responsibility,"" Oleksiy Reznikov summed up."

"President at COP26: Global thinking and world policy priorities need to change - not only financial, but also environmental growth",2021-11-01T19:26:00Z,"Stopping the process of global warming is possible only by changing global thinking and priorities of world politics, when a territory is considered not only as a market, but also as a home for thousands of flora and fauna representatives. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a speech at the COP 26 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (UK). The Head of State reminded that in the summer the Intergovernmental Group of Climate Change Experts published the 6th report, in which the best climatologists came to the paradoxical conclusion: increasing the efficiency of resource use increases, not reduces its consumption. ""It is a paradox, but the implementation of the Paris Agreement is endangered by the implementation of the Paris Agreement,"" the President said. According to him, the desire to keep warming at 2-1.5 degrees Celsius, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the use of coal and oil has led to record demand and gas prices. As a result, coal consumption in the G20 countries increased by 5%, and in coal-fired power plants in Europe in September - by a third. ""According to forecasts, the sector will continue to replace gas with these carriers, and emissions will be higher. According to the UN, the concentration of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere is a record of ten years. The temperature on Earth can rise much more than two degrees. New calculations show that in order to curb warming and achieve carbon neutrality, we will have to make many times more efforts than planned in Paris in 2015,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The President reminded that Ukraine had been one of the first in Europe to ratify the Paris Agreement and ranked 4th among 45 parties to the UN Framework Convention in terms of emission reduction. ""Our goal by 2030 is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 65% (from 1990 levels - ed.). And to achieve climate neutrality not later than 2060,"" the Head of State stressed. Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine supports a number of initiatives of this conference, including the Declaration on Forest and Land Use. It is also important for our country to have access to stable and long-term financing, in particular in the framework of the Green Climate Fund. The Head of State noted that neither the convention on stabilizing the concentration of greenhouse gases, nor the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement solve the problem, because these documents do not keep up with the challenges of today. Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, the extinction of the Great Barrier Reef, earthquakes in Haiti and the Indian Ocean, tsunamis, floods, fires, droughts around the world and even abnormal rainfall that flooded Glasgow two days before the climate summit, do not become alarm bells and do not speed up each of us. To overcome global warming, we need global warming in the relations of states where trust melts every year. Agreements are worthless if they are just words for someone. Both environmental agreements, and those that do not relate to the environment,"" the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy reminded that in 1994 Ukraine received security guarantees that were not fulfilled, and the planet received ""two eco-bombs in the center of Europe"": the occupied Crimea and part of Donbas. ""The Crimean peninsula with its unique flora and fauna has become a naval base of the Russian Federation. And in parts of Donbas there are flooding of mines, soil degradation, lack of drinking water. And all this takes place now. This is a common threat to the whole world. In our time, disaster, no matter where it happens, affects everyone,"" said the President. According to him, this is proved by the Chornobyl tragedy, which affected everyone, not just Ukraine. But this catastrophe has also shown that human intervention is an effective mechanism for restoring the environment, as nature in Chornobyl is recovering faster than expected. At the same time, the Head of State added that this does not mean that nothing should be done at all. ""We can give up. There will be floods and fires every week. We will be able to swim in the sea only in chemical protection suits. We will spend the rest of our lives in respirators. Clean drinking water will be available only on weekends. Products grown on non-toxic soil will be only for the New Year and special holidays. And the average life expectancy in the world will be 25-30 years. Perhaps this would be a fair punishment for us, for humanity. For those who have forgotten that this is our planet. And for those who forgot that this is not our planet - this is the planet of bears, tigers, pandas, koalas, whales, sharks,"" said the President. He added that there are thousands of species of living beings on Earth who cannot hold a summit, give up plastic, reduce CO2 emissions and so on. ""We are the only ones who can change it. And it is not the symptoms that need to be treated, but the root cause. We must change not the principles of production and subsoil use, but global thinking, global behavior. Priorities of world politics and each state. We must measure not only financial, but first of all ecological growth. Not only the level of GDP or inflation, but above all the level of purity of air, water, land. We must perceive a territory not as a market for goods or services, but as a home for thousands of flora and fauna representatives. We must be proud not of new models of technology, not only of the fact that we create something, but also of the fact that we preserve something,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. The President of Ukraine urged to implement the agreements that will be reached at the UN Climate Change Conference as soon as possible and to do that ""quickly and without delay, jointly and without exceptions""."

President at a meeting of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities in Odesa: Vaccination is necessary - this is the only solution for today,2021-10-29T15:36:00Z,"During a working trip to the Odesa region, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a meeting of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities discussing in detail the issue of combating the spread of COVID-19. ""Today we are witnessing another powerful wave of COVID-19, the ""Delta"" wave and the emergence of new strains. Every day there are anti-records around the world, and we are no exception. Every day in Ukraine there are anti-records of both the sick and, unfortunately, the dead,"" the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that the losses from the pandemic per day are already approaching the daily losses of the military during the Second World War. Therefore, officials, businesses and citizens should take steps to increase the number of vaccinated. ""We understand that the only way out is vaccination. We need to increase the percentage of people vaccinated to get out of this collapse. Leaders on the ground, I beg you to fall asleep and wake up with this topic,"" the Head of State urged. The President reminded that at the last meeting of the National Security and Defense Council the task was set to increase the number of vaccinations to 300,000 per day. And today in Ukraine about 290 thousand vaccinations are already made, but it is necessary to increase the rate of vaccination even more actively, because the number of patients and deaths is increasing. In this context, Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the media, including the central media, which joined the campaign to inform people about the importance and safety of vaccination. ""I beg you all to exclude social networks in this issue and turn on the brain. It is necessary to be vaccinated - today it is not a ""horror story"", it is the only solution. I want us not to be afraid of these ""horror stories"" in the media and social networks, but to be afraid of this virus,"" the President said, adding that today in the civilized world, a person's attitude to vaccination is almost an indicator of literacy and awareness. Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak noted that every official should warn citizens about the danger of COVID-19 on a daily basis and demonstrate the importance of vaccination by his own example. According to him, today there are enough vaccines against COVID-19 in Ukraine and a significant number of vaccination points have been opened. ""The government, the President's team, and all government agencies have done everything possible to organize this process, but there are still questions in some cities,"" Andriy Yermak said. He also said that in order to fulfill the task of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, representatives of the Cabinet of Ministers and the Office of the President will more often visit the regions of Ukraine, monitor and assist in resolving problematic issues on the ground. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, who took part in the work of the Congress via video call, spoke about the supply of oxygen to medical institutions where patients with COVID-19 are treated. ""There is enough oxygen. Enough oxygen stations have been established that generate oxygen on the ground. Where there is a need to deliver (oxygen - ed.), the Ministry of Health strictly adheres to the logistics of supplies. I am convinced that we can talk about providing hospitals with oxygen wherever it is needed,"" the head of government stressed. According to Minister of Health Viktor Lyashko, currently 16 regions of Ukraine have moved to the ""red"" level of epidemic danger. The healthcare system has 70,000 beds for COVID-19 patients, more than 48,000 of which are occupied, he said. Viktor Lyashko also reminded that oxygen consumption by the infected had increased five to six times. ""Today, 80% of hospitalized patients are oxygen dependent. Oxygen consumption has increased many times. In October, the two plants stopped for maintenance check to reboot and continue operating at a higher capacity. One plant has already resumed operations on Friday, another one will do so on Monday,"" the Minister said. According to forecasts, the plateau of morbidity is expected in a week. In conclusion, the President thanked the doctors, without whom Ukraine would not be able to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. The Head of State also called on the government not to allow delays in the payment of salaries and surcharges to doctors and other medical staff. ""From next year, our medical staff will receive at least thirteen and a half thousand, and doctors - at least twenty thousand hryvnias… But please note that there should be no delays on our part… I understand that they are short, not all over Ukraine, however, there can be no delays in the issue of salaries of our doctors,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed."

""We pass on the James Clark Ross icebreaker to the scientists of our Vernadsky Research Base. So far it has such a name. But most importantly, it was purchased by the state. This is the first time. I don't consider it a feat, but the news is really good. Ukraine is a member of prestigious world clubs of space and Antarctic states. And today Ukraine is returning or is beginning to return to the World Ocean,"" the President said. According to him, this provides Ukraine with great opportunities to research ocean resources and participate on an equal footing in global projects. The President stressed that the World Ocean is the area where the most scientific discoveries are taking place in the 21st century, and in order to have a worthy place in this space, our country must build its ships. In view of this, Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that he expects from Minister of Education and Science Serhiy Shkarlet a full-fledged, large-scale program of revival of the research fleet of Ukraine for a period of 5-10 years. ""We suggest setting such a high bar, it is not easy, but pretty logical. 36 research vessels, 12 of them ocean, ice class. Why so much? This is a very symbolic figure. Everything is simple. This is the number of ships in Ukraine's research fleet in 1991. When I became President, when our team came, there were zero research vessels in Ukraine. In 30 years, 36 ships have been lost,"" he said. The Head of State also called on the regions to join the development of this program, especially those with a shipbuilding tradition, relevant staff, educational institutions and production facilities."
