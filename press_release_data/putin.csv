http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68700,BRICS+ meeting,2022-06-24T17:30:00Z,Moscow Region,"Vladimir Putin attended a BRICS+ meeting involving the leaders of several invited states, held via videoconference.","The meeting's topic is Foster Partnership for Global Development in a New Era Towards Joint Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Taking part in the BRICS+ meeting were President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping, Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi, President of the Republic of South Africa Cyril Ramaphosa, Vice President of Brazil Hamilton Mourao, President of Algeria Abdelmadjid Tebboune, President of Argentina Alberto Fernandez, President of Egypt Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, President of Indonesia Joko Widodo, President of Iran Sayyid Ebrahim Raisi, President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, Prime Minister of Cambodia Hun Sen, Prime Minister of Malaysia Ismail Sabri Yaakob, President of Senegal Macky Sall, Prime Minister of Thailand Prayut Chan-o-cha, President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev, Prime Minister of Fiji Voreqe Bainimarama, and Prime Minister of Ethiopia Abiy Ahmed. * * * Speech by the President of the Russian Federation at the BRICS+ meeting President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends, First, I would like to welcome the guests of the BRICS Summit and express gratitude to President Xi Jinping for organising this meeting in such a broad format. We believe that it is very useful to hold BRICS+ meetings attended by the leaders of states that are interested in developing mutually beneficial cooperation with our association based on a similarity of views on current global political and economic issues and ways of dealing with them. It is notable that the leaders of the countries who are attending our meeting today stand for developing a truly democratic multipolar world order based on the principles of equality, justice and mutual respect where global trade and finance are free from obstacles and politically driven restrictions. I would like to point out that the importance of interaction with our partners who share our values has increased dramatically amid the current imbalances in international relations. This situation has been developing for a long time and is the inevitable result of a policy of those who advocate a so-called liberal world order towards eroding international law and undermining multilateral institutions. Seeking to preserve their domination, some countries have been working consistently to replace the existing global architecture that relies on the central role of the United Nations with a rules-based order. But it is not clear who invented these rules and what they are. Attempts to hinder the development of the states that are unwilling to live according to somebody's rules and the reckless use of illegal sanctions instruments, compounded by the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic, have aggravated the downturn in the global economy. Global trade is deeply mired in disputes, the settlement of which is deviating increasingly further from WTO norms and principles. Our colleagues mentioned the WTO today, but we know well what turn the situation within that organisation has taken over the past years. The international monetary system is being destabilised, and industrial, logistics and investment chains are being broken. Rapid price increases for food, energy and commodities is having a serious socioeconomic effect, especially on the development of countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East. Colleagues and friends, I would like to stress once again: this is not the result of the past few months and by no means a consequence of Russia's special military operation to protect Donbass. Once again, this jump in inflation did not happen yesterday. It has been happening over the past several years as a result of the long-term, and I want to stress this, irresponsible macroeconomic policy of the G7 countries, uncontrolled money creation and accumulated unsecured debts. This process was accelerated by the pandemic when both the supply and demand for goods and services drastically dropped on a global scale. The food market has been disrupted most severely. I said this at the recent St Petersburg International Economic Forum, and I want to say it again: they printed money, distributed it in their wealthy countries and, like a vacuum cleaner, started scooping up all the food from the global market. Only recently, the United States was a food exporter – a net exporter – but now, I think, their imports are about US$17 billion more than their exports. This is a dismal indicator for food markets around the world. Meanwhile, the soaring cost of essential agricultural commodities such as grain has hit the developing countries and markets the hardest as this is where bread and flour are vital for the survival of most of the population. I think it was French Queen Marie Antoinette who, looking over a crowd of starving citizens from her palace, reportedly said with indifference: ""If they have no bread let them eat cake."" This is the same cynicism that certain Western countries are now showing by destabilising the global production of agricultural products and dealing with this matter by restricting, for example, supplies of Russian and Belarusian fertilisers and impeding exports of Russian grain to world markets. Speaking of which, we are expecting a good harvest. God willing, everything will be fine and, if we supply 37 million tonnes to the world market this year, we would most likely be able to supply 50 million tonnes of grain. However, it is becoming more difficult to insure the transport that carries grain, bulk carriers, transactions under trade contracts, and so on. At the same time, they are artificially fuelling hysterics over, say, the suspension of Ukrainian grain shipments via Black Sea ports. Meanwhile, according to American, and our, estimates, this is about 5 or 6 million tonnes of wheat plus 7 million tonnes of corn – this is something, but it does not resolve the problems in the world grain market. But that's not even the point. I have said publicly many times, and want to emphasise again, that Russia is not preventing the export of Ukraine's grain from its territory; we are ready to ensure safe passage of grain ships via international waters if, of course, the Ukrainian military demines the ports and nearby waters. In addition, we have a relevant understanding with representatives of the UN Secretariat. As before, we lack one thing – a constructive approach from the current Kiev authorities. I would like to emphasise that Russia is a major and responsible participant in the world food market. We are certainly willing to continue fulfilling our contractual obligations on the supply of agricultural products, fertiliser, energy and other critical commodities in good faith. I would like to note that Russia continues rendering humanitarian aid to many countries that need it. Russia recently delivered foodstuffs to Lebanon, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Cuba, Sudan and others, without cost. Colleagues, I would like to note again that we have every opportunity to build up practical cooperation between the BRICS countries and its partners, the countries represented here. We feel your mutual interest in maintaining close business contacts. It is equally important for BRICS to expand cooperation with regional associations like ASEAN, the African Union, the Association of Caribbean States, the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Indian Ocean Rim Association. Of course, serious potential is opening up for cooperation between our states in the context of working in the integration processes between the Eurasian Economic Union and China's huge One Belt One Road infrastructure and trade project. In general, we are convinced that many serious problems on the global agenda can and must be resolved only by pooling efforts, and this summit is an example of constructive work in this respect. Thank you for your attention."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68696,BRICS Summit,2022-06-23T16:40:00Z,Moscow Region,"Vladimir Putin took part in the 14th BRICS Summit, held via videoconference and chaired by China.","The meeting's topic is Foster High-Quality BRICS Partnership, Usher in a New Era for Global Development. President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro, President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping, Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi, and President of the Republic of South Africa Cyril Ramaphosa are also taking part in the meeting. The Beijing Declaration of the 14th BRICS Summit formalises the key agreements of the meeting. * * * Speech by the President of the Russian Federation at the BRICS Summit President of Russia Vladimir Putin: President Xi Jinping, President Ramaphosa, President Bolsonaro, Prime Minister Modi, ladies and gentlemen, To begin with, I would like to join the previous speakers in thanking President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping and all our Chinese friends for their proactive efforts this year to promote our strategic partnership within BRICS. The countries that form this group have been seeking to step up their cooperation on all global and regional matters. The BRICS format has been consistently increasing its prestige and international influence. This is an objective process, since the five BRICS countries, as we all know, have immense political, economic, scientific, technical and human potential. We have everything we need to work together and achieve results for ensuring global stability and security, sustained growth and prosperity, and better well-being for our people. I believe that the topic of today's meeting, Foster High-Quality BRICS Partnership, Usher in a New Era for Global Development, is very relevant. Considering the complexity of the challenges and threats the international community is facing, and the fact that they transcend borders, we need to come up with collective solutions. BRICS can make a meaningful contribution to these efforts. We have repeatedly said that challenges like conflict settlement, the fight against terrorism and organised crime, including the criminal use of new technologies, climate change, and the spread of dangerous infections, can only be addressed through joint efforts. And, of course, it is only on the basis of honest and mutually beneficial cooperation that we can look for ways out of the critical situation that has emerged in the world economy because of the ill-conceived and selfish actions of certain states, which, by using financial mechanisms, are actually shifting their own macroeconomic policy mistakes onto the rest of the world. We are confident that today, as never before, the world needs the BRICS countries' leadership in defining a unifying and positive course for forming a truly multipolar system of interstate relations based on the universal norms of international law and the key principles of the UN Charter. In this context, we can count on support from many states in Asia, Africa and Latin America, which are seeking to pursue an independent policy. I am sure that by tradition the present BRICS Summit will be substantive and effective, and that we will manage to hold a frank and detailed exchange of views on all the most important global and regional issues and various aspects of strategic partnership, including in the extended dialogue format of BRICS+. Let me stress: Russia is ready to continue promoting close and versatile interaction with all BRICS partners and contributing to the group's greater role in international affairs. Thank you for your attention. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68689,Greetings to BRICS Business Forum participants,2022-06-22T14:30:00Z,NA,,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: President Xi Jinping, Friends, It is my pleasure to welcome representatives of governments and business communities, experts and industry professionals of the BRICS countries who have gathered at the traditional Business Forum. The Forum indeed plays a large practical role in promoting mutual trade and investment, strengthening cooperation ties and enhancing direct dialogue between business communities, not only within our Association, but also in a broader, global dimension. After all, the participants in the BRICS Business Forum represent the interests of a significant and the most dynamically developing part of the international economic community. In this regard, I would like to recall that our countries are home to more than 3 billion people, and together account for about a quarter of the global GDP, 20 per cent of trade and roughly 25 per cent of direct investments, while the total international reserves of the BRICS countries(as of the beginning of 2022) amount to about 35 per cent of world reserves. Hence the high relevance, in our opinion, of the theme of this Forum– Foster High-quality BRICS Partnership, Usher in a New Era for Global Development. It is also important that the agenda of the Forum is packed with truly crucial issues, such as ensuring sustainable growth of the global economy, preserving its openness, increasing cooperation in the field of digital economy, green growth, industry modernization, and building new transport and logistics chains. Russia supports the draft Beijing Initiative to be adopted following the Forum, which reaffirms determination of BRICS business circles to continue close joint work in all the areas mentioned. Entrepreneurs of our countries are forced to develop their business in a challenging environment when the Western partners neglect the basic principles of market economy, free trade, and inviolability of private property. They follow, in fact, an irresponsible macroeconomic course, including the launch of the""printing press""– uncontrolled emission and accumulation of unsecured debts. At the same time more and more politically motivated sanctions are continuously introduced, mechanisms of exerting pressure on competitors are further strengthened. There is intentional destruction of cooperation ties; transport and logistics chains are destroyed. And all this is contrary to common sense and basic economic logic, it undermines business interests on a global scale, negatively affecting the wellbeing of people, in effect, of all countries. As a result, the problems in the world economy become recurrent. What we see is an economic slowdown, growing unemployment, shortages in raw materials and components. Problems with ensuring global food security are getting worse; prices for grain crops and other basic agricultural products are being inflated. It is important that, despite all the problems and difficulties, BRICS business circles have been consistently enhancing mutually beneficial ties in the areas of trade, finance, and investment. For example, in the first three months of this year, trade between the Russian Federation and the BRICS countries increased by 38 per cent– and reached USD 45 billion. Contacts between Russian business circles and the business community of the BRICS countries have intensified. For example, negotiations are underway to open Indian chain stores in Russia, increase the share of Chinese cars, equipment, and hardware on our market. ­­­ In its turn, Russia's presence in the BRICS countries is growing.­­ There has been a noticeable increase in the exports of Russian oil to China and India. ­ Agricultural cooperation is developing dynamically. Russia exports considerable amounts of fertilizers to the BRICS states. Russian IT companies are expanding their activities in India and South Africa, and our satellites enable TV broadcasting for as many as 40 million residents of Brazil.­­­ Together with BRICS partners, we are developing reliable alternative mechanisms for international settlements. The Russian Financial Messaging System is open for connection with the banks of the BRICS countries. The Russian MIR payment system is expanding its presence. ­­We are exploring the possibility of creating an international reserve currency based on the basket of BRICS currencies.­ The Russian business community, in coordination with the business communities of the BRICS states, takes prompt steps to develop the transport infrastructure. Logistics routes are readjusted, new production chains are created. I would like to stress that Russia's strategy has not changed: while strengthening our economic, technological and scientific potential, we are ready to work openly with all bona fide partners based on the principles of mutual respect for each other's interests, the primacy of international law, and equality for all nations and peoples. During my address at the recent St Petersburg International Economic Forum, I have already spoken in detail about our plans for further economic development and the creation of comfortable conditions for business in general, including foreign business. It is significant that representatives of foreign companies and entrepreneurs who came to St Petersburg showed their willingness to continue working on the Russian market and adapt to new conditions. And we will certainly provide all the necessary assistance to them. In general, I would like to note that Russia is taking comprehensive measures aimed at mitigating the negative impact of sanctions and strengthening our trade and investment relations with all the states concerned. Our macroeconomic policy shows its effectiveness in practice. We were able to protect the Russian financial system and begin to stabilize the situation in the industry by providing targeted social support to citizens. The Russian state, first of all, focuses on stimulating the private initiative. We strive to expand entrepreneurial freedoms by reducing the administrative burden, launching new easy-term lending programs, and introducing tax and customs exemptions. We are actively engaged in redirecting our trade flows and foreign economic contacts to reliable international partners, first of all, the BRICS countries. Taking the opportunity, I am pleased to invite representatives of your states to the Eastern Economic Forum, which will be held in Vladivostok in early September, where many issues relevant to the BRICS business community will also be discussed. In conclusion, I would like to express my confidence that the work of the Business Forum of our Association will continue to focus on expanding trade, business, investment and production ties of the BRICS countries. Certainly, I would like to thank the President of the People's Republic of China, Mr. Xi Jinping, and all Chinese friends for organizing this Forum, and I wish its participants success and all the best. Thank you."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68687,Meeting of State Council Presidium,2022-06-21T17:15:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin chaired a videoconference meeting of the State Council Presidium on the Strategy for Developing the Construction Industry and Housing and Utilities until 2030 with a forecast to 2035.,"President Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, good afternoon. As we agreed, today we will discuss the development of the construction industry as well as the housing and utilities sector. These areas are essential for economic growth and for improving the quality of people's lives. I would like to point out that our construction industry has enormous potential as a driver for the development of the regions and for Russia as a whole. We must fully realise this. To use this potential, we need to continue to clear bureaucratic barriers from all stages of construction and from the operations, introduce effective financial and investment tools, and expand the space for business initiative. And of course, like other areas in our life, we need to develop the construction, housing and utilities sector on a fundamentally new technological basis. The set of objectives and the approaches to implementing them have been outlined in the presented draft Strategy for Developing the Construction Industry and Housing and Utilities until 2030. It also defines some measures with a forecast until 2035. I would say that the Housing and Urban Environment national project should be extended to 2030 in light of the approaches set out in the strategy document. One of the key basic areas of our work is to make housing more affordable. For every family, a flat or a house is not just a material possession but also a solid foundation for having and bringing up children, for a happy and prosperous life. It is not without reason that our ancestors used to say:""He who has his own home is happy."" According to surveys, more than 65 percent of Russians would like to improve their living conditions. And as you know, we pay constant attention to this issue. For example, last year, in the difficult circumstances of the pandemic, our construction workers worked quickly and efficiently without exaggeration; more than 92 million square metres of housing was completed– I think 92.6 million. Over 4 million families moved into new flats and houses. In this regard, I would like to thank all the workers in the construction sector, which amounts to hundreds of thousands, even millions of professionals in various fields. This breakthrough in increasing the rate at which we complete new housing was possible because of preferential mortgage lending programmes, among other things. However, we all know that in April three times fewer mortgage loans were issued than in the same period last year. We talked about this at the forum in St Petersburg. The average market rate on home loans is now over 14 percent. However, my colleagues and I have discussed this, and the Government is well aware of it; this may not even be just about rates. I can say that we are lowering the rate, as I said at the forum in St Petersburg, but again, analysts believe that this is not the only issue. The thing is, the majority of people who were going to improve their housing conditions now, in these conditions– please excuse my tone– have not done so. However, this is not important, we will not be talking about how diverse the reasons are, but still, according to analyst's estimates, at such high interest rates mortgages become difficult for most of our citizens, while it is the availability of such loans that ensures long-term stable demand for housing in new buildings. At the recent economic forum in St Petersburg I asked the Government to consider lowering the preferential interest rates on mortgages from 9 to 7 percent, as you know. I am asking the Government, together with the Bank of Russia, our banking community as a whole, and the construction industry, to implement this measure as efficiently and quickly as possible. In general, we need to ensure that the volume of housing completed this year is no less than last year, and that the increase in the mortgage portfolio is no less than 2.5 trillion rubles. It is clear that not everyone can buy a flat or a house, so the regions need to increase the construction of flat rentals with support from the Government, and moreover, provide for the possibility of its subsequent purchase with preferential mortgage support or with instalments. In order to implement this proposal, it is necessary to adopt legislative bills. It is necessary to carry out this work as quickly as possible this year and make the procedure of providing land plots for rental housing as easy as possible, preferably on special terms, and to provide for a mechanism for the effective market financing of such projects. I want to ask the speakers today to focus on the work to relocate residents from dilapidated housing. This problem concerns and directly affects many of our citizens who have to live in unacceptable conditions, let's be honest. We have everything we need to increase the rate of relocating people from dilapidated buildings and to renew the country's residential housing. We need to set ambitious goals while taking into account the budget capacities and the resources of the construction sector. I know that our builders are ready to work even harder both on the construction of residential housing and on other major complex projects in order to promptly create a comfortable, contemporary living environment in our cities and villages. Again, it is necessary to lift any arbitrary barriers in this area. The documents related to socioeconomic and territorial planning, as well as road and urban development are often still not synchronised, unfortunately. All this not only extends the timeframe needed for construction, but also makes decision-making more difficult and leads to the uneven development of territories because construction is often carried out without regard to future plans. As a result, the urban space is reduced, the general cityscape and unique features of cities and villages are ignored, while the load on the infrastructure increases. The long-term consequences of this are not researched, but it often happens that people purchase a flat and then have to spend hours commuting to work or taking their children to a school at the other end of the city or cannot enrol kids in a kindergarten. They buy a nice flat but immediately face other problems. So, of course, it is necessary to try to prevent these things. I want to ask the regional governors to report in detail on the work done locally in their regions, the streamlining of the urban development process and what hinders them from coordinating it with the territorial development plans. It is crucial that you resolve these problems. Then the money allocated through our infrastructure budgetary loan programme will be spent more efficiently. These are large amounts of money, and they need to be spent rationally. The obstacles I have mentioned have been discussed many times, and it is good that there are real, notable changes for the better. In particular, several excessive permit requirements have been eliminated, useless restrictions lifted, and the number of land plots allocated for construction has increased significantly. However, it can still take up to two years to make a decision on an urban development project. We need, especially now, to value our time so that the funds from both the state and the construction industry are used more promptly, so our citizens can see tangible results such as improved public spaces and new housing. As soon as next year, we need to create a digital register of clear, comprehensive requirements for the construction sector, and ensure maximum transparency here. Another specific goal is to gradually, in eighteen to twenty-four months, complete the construction of previously frozen projects. See, we always talk about this– about frozen construction projects. Finally, we need to organise this in an appropriate way, to provide additional funding for these purposes, if necessary. After all, we have always managed to find solutions, even in the most difficult conditions, that we do not need to launch new projects as much as we need to complete the existing ones. Of course, the situation with unfinished projects needs to be addressed because this is""buried"" money that has not yielded results. Construction sites that have been frozen for years create inconvenience and problems for people and degrade the appearance of cities and towns. Further, certainly the state of affairs in the construction sector has become more complicated due to the sanctions. But together we should look for and find opportunities to maintain the pace of development in this key industry, including by supporting domestic building materials manufacturers. Our objective is to increase their share in the domestic market to 95 percent. I can add that in terms of equipment for building materials companies and construction equipment, including excavators, graders and dump trucks, we are still heavily dependent on the import of components and machinery. I believe that, just as we started doing in the fuel and energy sector, we need to establish partnerships so construction enterprises can jointly invest in R&D and in the development of this equipment and guarantee large-scale production orders for domestic suppliers in the future. By the way, here we can use the sites of new industrial clusters with attractive regime and industrial mortgages. We also talked about this at the St Petersburg forum. In addition, for the construction industry,""long,"" affordable financial resources are important, both from the state and from the banking system. Construction, housing, is a large field of work. Unfortunately, we are still lagging behind many countries, including our neighbours, in terms of providing citizens with housing. To resolve the problem of housing, we really need hundreds of millions, in total, several billion square metres of new housing. Public demand for new housing, and above all for a better quality of life, is incredible. Moreover, the money invested here comes back at a good rate of return to the state budget and brings profits to banks and investors. We need now– and this is very important– to change, to break many of the established stereotypes that prevent us from moving forward, and as I said, do this while maintaining a responsible macroeconomic policy, to create conditions for investing more in real assets, in development. And housing construction is just such an asset. Colleagues, The problem with upgrading housing and utilities sector remains difficult. The total deterioration of various systems is estimated at over 40 percent. I think I also talked about this in St Petersburg. Hence the inefficiency and losses, which ultimately fall on companies and people. We have made many decisions here, looking for the best economic model, including for working with management companies. We gave them greater authority, then reduced it, then we created conditions for competition, then again we returned to establishing a single control centre. But reality shows– and I think the governors will agree with me– that we won't achieve any real change in improving housing and utility services while it's all based on old, worn-out infrastructure. We can rearrange the chairs, as they say, or make other decisions, but basically, if the pipes are rotten, nothing will fundamentally change. I believe that a large-scale upgrade of systems and other infrastructure is indeed the key to solving these problems in the housing and utilities sector and, most importantly, ensuring predictable, transparent and understandable utility rates for people. That is why, as you know, I proposed launching a comprehensive programme to upgrade housing and utilities. At its core, the goal is to consolidate and attract solid investment here; the volume must be increased many times over. At the same time, the country produces everything necessary to replace worn-out systems such as metal, machinery, domestic equipment and materials. So, we will load the construction and related industries, create jobs for years to come, and people will see real changes for the better. In a word, we need to get down to business and address these seemingly insurmountable issues step by step without retreating. The specific goal is to achieve an annual reduction in the share of worn-out systems. Such a plan may initially take, say, five years. Let's discuss all these issues today. And the Government has to think all this through and identify the sources of funding. We just talked with Mr Khusnullin, and I also talked with the Minister of Finance. Yes, financing is an essential element. It must be worked out with all agencies by the end of the year and we must begin to implement it next year. Let's get to work. I give the floor to Mr Marat Khusnullin. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68685,Meeting with graduates of higher military schools,2022-06-21T13:20:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow","In the Grand Kremlin Palace, the President met with top graduates of higher military schools of the Defence Ministry, the Emergencies Ministry, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Guard Service and the National Guard, as well as higher education institutions of the Interior Ministry and the Federal Penitentiary Service.","President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comradeofficers, friends, I am glad to welcome and congratulate you on your successful graduation. Today we honour top graduates of military academies, universities, and specialised educational establishments here in the Kremlin's St George Hall, the symbol of military glory of the Fatherland. You are going to carry on the legendary traditions of valour and honour, solidarity and patriotism, which have always served as a reliable support for the Army and Navy. It was so throughout the centuries-old history of Russia: in the battles of Chudskoye Lake, Poltava and Borodino, during the First World War and the Great Patriotic War. Today's Russian officers and soldiers– the successors of the generation of victors, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the Great Patriotic War heroes– are selflessly fighting for the Fatherland, for our people, fighting international terrorists in Syria, protecting Donbass from neo-Nazis, and defending peace and security for our people, and Russia's right to sovereign development. We are proud of our servicemen acting bravely and professionally, like true heroes, during the special military operation. Russian soldiers of different nationalities fight shoulder to shoulder. In this unity, belief in the justice of their cause, in that huge, truly popular support that our soldiers feel, is the great, invincible power of Russia. We will continue to develop and strengthen our Armed Forces, considering potential threats and risks, and improve their combat power based on the lessons from today's military conflicts. The priority areas include equipping troops with new weapon systems that will determine the combat effectiveness of the Army and Navy in the years and decades to come. In addition to the new weapons already tested on the battlefield, the troops have begun to receive S-500 air and missile defence systems that have no analogues in the world. The Sarmat heavy intercontinental ballistic missile was successfully tested. It is expected that the first such complex will be on combat duty at the end of the year. Plans call for using robotics, the most advanced means of control and reconnaissance, and drones much more widely, as well as actively developing weapon systems based on new physical principles. I am talking about laser, electromagnetic and other weapons. And, of course, intensive combat training of military units and groups will continue, as well as practising interaction with our allies. The effectiveness of our work to improve Russia's defensive capacity directly depends on the officer corps, that is, on you and your colleagues. You will soon take charge of military units. I am sure that you will help your subordinates, brothers in arms to master the advanced military equipment and will be an example of honour and team spirit. Comrade officers, You are young, energetic and daring people, highly motivated, and this is great. Still, I urge you to be careful, think things through and gradually learn about the current service environment. Do not forget that the effective use of theoretical knowledge you got when training is only possible after receiving some practical experience. Of course, working with personnel is a crucial task. I want to quote General Mikhail Dragomirov, a prominent military theorist:""The devotion to the Motherland and to the interests of a common cause is the main goal of military education."" Comrade officers, The development of Russia and the security of our citizens directly depend on the efficient work of the law-enforcement system and special services, the reliable work of rescuers. I want to warmly greet officers who will soon join the ranks of the Federal Security Service and the Interior Ministry, the National Guard, the Emergencies Ministry, the Federal Guard Service, the Investigative Committee and the Federal Penitentiary Service. Your main tasks include the protection of legal rights and freedoms of Russian citizens, an uncompromising fight against terrorist and extremist threats, against crime and corruption. I am sure that you will work in a systemic and consistent way and serve as an example of decency and professionalism for your colleagues. Friends, You have chosen the difficult military path as your career and have already achieved high and excellent results. On this day, I would like to pass on words of sincere gratitude to your mentors and everyone who shared their knowledge and experience, taught you to stay loyal to the laws of military brotherhood and camaraderie, and wholeheartedly strove for you to become real military professionals. You have the high honour of becoming Russian officers. Be worthy of this title: serve the Motherland and our people honestly and professionally. I wish you and all the graduates of 2022 good health and success. Good luck. <…> Vladimir Putin: Comrade officers, You have just completed your studies and understand very well that every thinking person in Russia constantly analyses everything that happens inside and outside our country. There has probably never been a time in the history of Russia when we simply felt that we could do nothing, as in a prosperous, but hardly visible country on the map. Russia has always gone through trials, just like any person who strives towards their goal; they always go through certain trials. It almost never happens that someone is simply taken by the hand and led to the desired result, and if someone was led by hand, then, as a rule, this person cannot effectively deal with what they got, what fell from the sky. In order to achieve a goal, you always need to go through certain difficulties, but, as you know, walk and you shall reach. Russia is now going through another set of trials, and we all know how closely the entire world and our country are watching the developments in the civilian sphere. Yes, there are restrictions. Yes, there are different ways to overcome them. And we can and will overcome them. The same is happening in the sphere of the state military establishment. Our army and navy are improving in all the most important segments in accordance with today's requirements, and this improvement will benefit the army, navy and the entire state military establishment. There can be no doubt that we will become even stronger. And the effectiveness of this process largely depends on you. I wish you all good luck once again. All the best."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68680,Meeting with Murmansk Region Governor Andrei Chibis,2022-06-20T13:45:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Andrei Chibis reported to the President on the results of the Murmansk Region's socioeconomic development over a period of three years as well as on the upcoming projects.,"At the beginning of the meeting Vladimir Putin noted that the general situation in the region was satisfactory, with gross regional product, industrial production, agriculture and construction growing. At the same time, the President noted that though investment in fixed assets was increasing, unemployment was slightly higher than the national average. Andrei Chibis explained that the employment service was being restructured and added that it was necessary to consider the specifics of the region, such as the peculiarities of employment in the fishing industry. However, there is work to be done. The Governor said that over the three years he has been in office, investment has grown 30 percent, or 600 billion rubles; industrial production increased 17 percent; and economic growth 16 percent. Average real income, adjusted for inflation, grew 13 percent. The revenue base has increased by 1.8 times, and public debt has decreased by a third. The ""Arctic Capital"" priority development area and the Arctic incentives have yielded results. Over this period, new corporate residents have invested 100 billion rubles and created 3,000 jobs. The Arctic Hectare programme is ongoing. Over 1,700 people have received land plots, and another 600 applications are being processed. As part of regional support under the Governor's Start-up Programme, 1 million rubles have been made available for business development. The Governor further spoke about things that could encourage further development of the region. Gas distribution was the first key issue: in particular, this would provide the capacity to process natural resources extracted on the Kola Peninsula. According to the most conservative estimates, natural gas distribution would attract 400 billion rubles in investment and create 20,000 new jobs, as well as cut household heating costs by 30 percent, and reduce sulphur dioxide emissions due to upgrading or closing polluting industries. Andrei Chibis noted that the Government had determined the viability of a gas pipeline from Volkhov in the Leningrad Region to Murmansk (1,367 km), but that the President's decision was necessary to start this process and determine the sources of financing. The Murmansk transport hub was another strategic issue for the region. Last year, construction of a new port began on the western coast of Kola Bay. It will be completed in 2023, and it is important to provide a railway connection. When the project is completed, the Murmansk port will be able to receive up to 80 million tonnes of cargo by 2030. Andrei Chibis also talked about the fishing industry and ship repair. Murmansk fishing port upgrades are being launched as part of the territory's integrated development, including new infrastructure for crab and fish processing. Draft decisions have been prepared with the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Government. Presidential approval is required. The discussion also touched upon the topic of integrated development of the Northern Fleet garrisons. In addition, social issues were discussed, such as benefits for young specialists in the North, measures to increase the birth rate and attract young families with children to the region, temporary work for teenagers and those who cannot find permanent work, as well as support for veterans and ""children of the Great Patriotic War,"" those who survived the war as children."

Relying on many traditions created by Society members in 1866, the reconstituted RHS has pooled the efforts of the state, society and professional historians to create a national historical culture, preserve national history and foster objective historical knowledge at the nationwide level and in individual regions of Russia. An active and creative stand of RHS members, including the leading research institutions, universities, museums, archives, libraries and individual historians, is helping enhance the standards of historical education, increase the accessibility of archival heritage and strengthen the positions of the national historical science. Of great importance today are the RHS education projects, which are designed for a broad range of young people interested in history. The Russian Historical Society has always been noted for professionalism, commitment to the historical truth and respect for all periods in our past. During the ongoing special military operation in Ukraine, the RHS has reaffirmed its solid patriotic stand through deeds and is doing an important and much-needed job."""
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68673,Healthcare centres opening in Russian regions,2022-06-18T16:10:00Z,St Petersburg,"Ahead of Medical Worker Day, Vladimir Putin took part in a video conference on the opening of new healthcare centres in some regions of the Russian Federation.","Taking part in the event were Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova, Healthcare Minister Mikhail Murashko, heads of several regions and managers of new medical centres. The newly opened medical centres include oncology centres in Ulan-Ude and Volgograd, infectious desease hospitals in Belgorod and Orenburg, a medical rehabilitation facility at the Federal Centre for Traumatology, Orthopaedy and Endoprosthetics in Cheboksary, an outpatient clinic in Novosibirsk, two outpatient clinics in St Petersburg reopened after major renovations, as well as eleven first-aid stations in the Sverdlovsk and Chelyabinsk regions. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends. I am happy to greet you all. Just these days, including today, 19 medical centres are opening in various regions across Russia. These are hospitals specialising in infectious diseases, oncology centres, outpatient clinics and first-aid stations. I sincerely wish success to your staff and greet you, all your colleagues, the staff of federal and regional health centres, district and city hospitals, outpatient clinics, emergency medicine crews, ambulance crews, air medical service, and military medics on the upcoming Medical Worker Day. I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to the entire medical community of Russia for your courageous selfless work, for loyalty to the best traditions of numerous generations of our doctors, paramedics and nurses, for following your mission with tremendous dignity, because the professionalism of a true doctor and medical professional is inseparable from your spiritual generosity. We know how much courage, patience, compassion and self-sacrifice you demonstrated during the critical periods of the coronavirus pandemic. The medical workers of Russia display these very qualities while helping residents of the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics and civilians in the liberated territories. I would like to specially address military doctors, medical assistants and junior medical staff at the hospitals of the Defence Ministry, the Federal Guards and other security agencies, to those who are rendering medical aid on the frontline under shelling, often risking their lives. We bow to you for saving the lives of our comrades-in-arms who are engaged in the special military operation. Friends, An efficient, modern healthcare system is of crucial importance for the preservation of the Russian nation; therefore, we continue increasing the capacities of medical centres, support our scientists who run research and practice centres, and the industry in creating advanced diagnostics and treatment technology and cutting-edge medical equipment. Our mission is to improve the accessibility and quality of medical aid so that all people in our vast country can see improvements and positive trends in this area. It especially concerns the residents of small towns and communities, the elderly and families with children. Our absolute priority here is to upgrade primary care. I am well aware that the staff of outpatient clinics and first-aid stations have huge workloads as well as great responsibility because you are closest to the people: you are the first they come to, because the diagnosis and subsequent treatment depend on you. The importance of your work is impossible to overestimate. We will definitely continue increasing support for primary care specialists and all those employed in the Russian healthcare system. Despite the current challenges, we are fully implementing plans for the construction, modernisation and re-equipment of hospitals, outpatient clinics and first-aid stations, and we will ensure the procurement of ambulance vehicles and mobile ambulance stations so that a doctor, a medical assistant or a nurse can work in up-to-date conditions and render people all the help they need. Construction and installing equipment in those new medical centres with whose staff we are now in contact is part of those big, large-scale efforts. Tens of thousands of people will receive medical aid there. I will note that capabilities for rendering specialised and high-tech help will increase significantly. Friends, I congratulate again all the medical workers of our vast country on the coming holiday, all those who chose this noble and compassionate profession. I wish you good health, success and all the very best. <…> Vladimir Putin: The development of the healthcare system is obviously one of the key and fundamental areas of our work at all levels, starting from municipalities to the federal level. This includes both high-tech federal centres and first-aid stations. We saw the opening of such facilities today. We have been persistently increasing funding for these purposes in the past years, and the funding will keep increasing in the coming years. Everything matters here: the personnel, equipment and modern technology. Concerning equipment, we should certainly pay more attention to the capabilities of the Russian industry. We should give credit to the military-industrial complex system. They are facing the issue of production conversion, a transition to civilian equipment manufacturing, and of the areas in which they succeeded the most is precisely the production of medical equipment. There are many other areas, many of them. The healthcare system in itself is a huge sector that is crucial for the country, as I have said. We will keep working for the benefit of our citizens to provide a high level of medical aid. It is important both for health preservation and for the nation's future, population growth and rising life expectancy, that is, for future generations, for the children. Everything in this area has major importance, every aspect. I once again congratulate you on the holiday and wish you success. Thank you very much."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68672,Meeting with Member of Bosnia and Herzegovina Presidency Milorad Dodik,2022-06-18T00:05:00Z,St Petersburg,Vladimir Putin had a meeting with Serbian Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Milorad Dodik on the sidelines of the SPIEF 2022.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: I am happy to see you. Good evening. We have had very good relations since you became head of Republika Srpska and in your current position. Thank you for coming to the St Petersburg Forum. I hope it was useful and interesting for you. Regrettably, in the current environment, relations between our two countries have been complicated due to Bosnia and Herzegovina's support of the anti-Russia sanctions, but we are aware of your position and highly appreciate it. Despite the challenges, our relations will continue and will develop, especially with those who want to maintain them. As far as I know, you are among them. We are happy to se you. Welcome. Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Milorad Dodik(retranslated): Thank you, Mr President, for your words of encouragement. I want to thank you for everything you are doing for us. Today was a hard day. In general, we are going through hard times, difficult conditions, as you mentioned repeatedly in your speech we heard today. We are trying to maintain our policy without outside influence; we did not want to join the sanctions and are grateful to you for your understanding on this matter. Thank you for making it possible to retain gas prices under the earlier conditions until next year. We think that Russian fuel has no alternatives and we want to continue with investments. I spoke to Mr Miller today, and we are moving along this path, with the construction of a gas pipeline branch. Some procedurals have to be completed connected with the treaty between Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina for the branch to be constructed. Russian businesses continue operating in the Republika Srpska; Zarubezhneft has retained jobs and its business. We continue working on developing our cooperation in medicine, and many Russian specialists, in particular from St Petersburg, come to Banja Luka. Universities and faculties maintain interaction, and everything is moving on quite well, of course. Therefore, we are closely following the situation around Ukraine and understand the context. We believe that the West is just trying to interfere everywhere. We have been living like that for over twenty years, so the situation remains the same with us. I would like to tell you– and I told you this last time, that they have made a further step and appointed a German, without the Security Council's endorsement, who calls himself a high representative and imposes some kind of laws on us. He is causing additional destabilisation, which cannot be accepted. We refuse to recognise such a situation, and we cannot do otherwise. On the other hand, a European military mission called ALTHEA, which is annually extended through the Security Council, is located in Bosnia and Herzegovina. <…>"

I hope coming to St Petersburg and looking around at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum was worth it. We have been holding this event for 25 years, and it has become a hallmark, at least for our country, for Russia. I hope for our partners as well. And Armenia is not just our partner– it is our strategic ally, and we appreciate it. We understand everything that is happening today in and around Armenia. We are determined to expand our partnership. We are interested in ensuring stability and progressive development in your country. I strongly hope that today's meeting will also contribute to this. So, it is a pleasure to see you. Welcome. President of the Republic of Armenia Vahagn Khachaturyan: Mr Putin, I certainly feel very good here. It has been a long time since I visited St Petersburg, although I used to come here often during the Soviet times, that is, in the 1980s and up to 1992. For me, it is also an opportunity to see how much the city has changed. As a former mayor of a city, I can also assess how good the city really looks. I remember that at that time the city was different; it is so clean and beautiful now. I am aware of your personal feelings about St Petersburg. I feel the same towards Yerevan: I keep looking and thinking what can be improved. I understand that St Petersburg leaders feel the same, and there is also your involvement, too. As for the St Petersburg forum, it is my first time here, unfortunately; that's just how it happened. But I have always followed it as an economist and praised it because it is a venue for very important and interesting discussions about the economy. Yesterday's discussion at the platforms was also very interesting with the country's economic leaders, your aide[Maxim Oreshkin], Economy Minister[Maxim Reshetnikov] and Central Bank Governor[Elvira Nabiullina] as speakers. I tried to envision, as a specialist, how things would unfold, and my expert evaluation coincided with what you said today. By the way, I was following especially closely the matters I am knowledgeable about. I may not be a great expert in politics and I am only a beginner in diplomacy, but I have always been focusing on economic aspects and I want to say that I agree with the conclusions you made. This is indeed a new age. Actually, we all have to start thinking about how to develop under new conditions, which offer new opportunities. I agree, among other things, with the conclusions by the Central Bank Governor: we should not think that the situation will change and the sanctions will be lifted. We just have to adjust and prepare the economy for quite different challenges. I believe that Russia's economy will withstand these trials in view of the resources and opportunities available and considering the two months that have elapsed. The expectations and prediction, even by Russian specialists, financiers and economists– you also mentioned that– did not come true. It is also interesting which methods were used by the Central Bank, the economic agencies and the Finance Ministry for the ruble to recover, inflation to stop and development to continue. Even now, the current, recent assessments by the International Monetary Fund have already changed for the better. Thank you very much for inviting me. I feel very good here, and I had a great welcome. I would like to express my personal gratitude for this opportunity to meet you. It is a great honour for me as a person– I am sincere in saying that. I did not have such an opportunity even in the 1990s– we could have met as colleagues back then, as I worked as a city mayor and you worked in St Petersburg mayors' office. It is a great honour for me. I believe the Armenian people appreciate your efforts in settling the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. I can assure you that what you did during the hostilities, your efforts, which stopped the war– I am not the only person who appreciates that. I know that the Armenian people also appreciate it. In reality, we meant to stop that war in some way earlier, and I am aware of your efforts. You had a chance[to do that] as early as October 19[2020]– we spoke about that with Mr Lavrov when he was in Yerevan. But it happened that the war stopped on November 9[2020], and this is what matters most. Your efforts to make sure there are no more hostilities, that the agreements between you, the Prime Minister of Armenia and the President of Azerbaijan are reinforced and observed, all that is also very important for us. I do not want to talk about our historical friendship and so on. Do you know why? Because when you have brotherly relations, you do not say""a good brother"" or""a bad brother."" Brotherly relations mean brotherly. In essence, this is everything: trust, sincerity, joint programmes that must go on. It was not me who decided that– it was decided by our ancestors 200 year ago or earlier that we must live together, use our joint efforts to develop. This is my stance as a citizen and as a human being. It helps me now that I am President because I understand that the Government and the Prime Minister have the same commitment. The latest official visit by our Prime Minister[Nikol Pashinyan] also has great significance for us. This visit had a tremendous impact on the overall domestic political situation because before it, there were different rumours, but it was very important how you received him here and what he felt when visiting Nizhny Novgorod. I believe that our further relations will continue progressing. What we need is to help the country's leadership, I mean Armenia, and if there are any issues, they should be resolved and normal conditions should be established. When I was a government minister, I met my Russian colleagues, especially representatives of the military-industrial complex. I realised that we have no restrictions in our talks: we can speak openly about anything, and if there are some programmes, we can pursue them together. <…>"

Thank you very much for coming to the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. It is important for us to emphasise our special relationship and, of course, to have an opportunity to compare views with you personally on major issues, primarily on the economy, of course. This was just mentioned at the forum. By the way, I think I made a slip of the tongue there. I mentioned a $7 billion investment but actually we have invested $17 billion in the economy of Kazakhstan. Our trade is growing. You just said so yourself. Last year it amounted to $25 billion and exceeded $12 billion in the first three months. If it continues like this, we will set a record. This year we will observe the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations. We will celebrate this as well. And the regional forum is still ahead. In general, our governments are working very intensively. Times are difficult and they are looking for solutions to every arising issue. We will have an opportunity to talk about this now, both here during the talks and informally at the informal dinner. President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev Tokayev Kassym-JomartPresident of the Republic of Kazakhstan: Mr Putin, I was pleased to receive your invitation to take part in this prestigious forum. I listened to your remarks with interest. Your speech was basically an address to the nation in content and length. The audience listened with interest. I think there will be a very good response to it throughout the world. As for bilateral cooperation, there is no reason to worry. Everything is going fine. We are working on specific industrial and agricultural projects. Investment cooperation is making steady headway. This year is special, indeed– the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations. In other words, we have every reason to talk about our great success in developing bilateral cooperation, and I think we will continue developing this positive momentum. Yes, indeed, there are some questions that require clarification. We can discuss them at the next bilateral meeting or during the dinner. Thank you again for your invitation. <…>"

I am pleased to note that these prestigious and spectacular competitions are becoming a good tradition and a noteworthy event in the life of our Northern Capital and the entire country. They bring together the strongest teams from Russia and other countries, and largely reflect the state of modern judo and development trends of this dazzling and dynamic martial art. Your tournament also makes a serious contribution to popularising and promoting martial arts, their philosophy and values. In this connection, I would like to thank the staff of the Yawara Neva Club, including talented wrestlers, coaches, mentors and tutors, for the excellent organisation of the competitions and for the invariably excellent results. Today, Yawara Neva is rightfully seen as one of the top-scoring teams, which remains a many-time and current European champion. I am sure that exciting and intense bouts and uncompromising battles of personalities await the spectators and tournament participants, and that the Yawara Challenge will continue to develop, expand its horizons and attract new dedicated admirers."""

President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping and President of the Arab Republic of Egypt Abdel Fattah el-Sisi addressed the session via videoconference. The theme this year is New Opportunities in a New World. * * * Plenary session moderator Margarita Simonyan: Good afternoon, or almost evening. As you may know, we had a minor technical issue. Thankfully, it has been dealt with quickly. We are grateful to those who resolved this. We are also grateful to the audience. We are grateful to our leader, President Vladimir Putin, for traditionally fitting this forum into his schedule so that he can tell us about economic prospects and other plans. We are grateful to President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev for attending our forum. We know that it is not an easy thing to do. Thank you for supporting our forum and our country. We really appreciate this. We will have a lot of questions today. You may not like some of them, and I may not be happy to ask some of them. We would be much happier to speak only about good things, but this is impossible today. Mr President, I would like to ask you to take the stand and to tell us what lies in store for us all. Thank you. President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much. President Tokayev, friends and colleagues, I welcome all participants and guests of the 25th St Petersburg International Economic Forum. It is taking place at a difficult time for the international community when the economy, markets and the very principles of the global economic system have taken a blow. Many trade, industrial and logistics chains, which were dislocated by the pandemic, have been subjected to new tests. Moreover, such fundamental business notions as business reputation, the inviolability of property and trust in global currencies have been seriously damaged. Regrettably, they have been undermined by our Western partners, who have done this deliberately, for the sake of their ambitions and in order to preserve obsolete geopolitical illusions. Today, our – when I say ""our,"" I mean the Russian leadership – our own view of the global economic situation. I would like to speak in greater depth about the actions Russia is taking in these conditions and how it plans to develop in these dynamically changing circumstances. When I spoke at the Davos Forum a year and a half ago, I also stressed that the era of a unipolar world order has come to an end. I want to start with this, as there is no way around it. This era has ended despite all the attempts to maintain and preserve it at all costs. Change is a natural process of history, as it is difficult to reconcile the diversity of civilisations and the richness of cultures on the planet with political, economic or other stereotypes – these do not work here, they are imposed by one centre in a rough and no-compromise manner. The flaw is in the concept itself, as the concept says there is one, albeit strong, power with a limited circle of close allies, or, as they say, countries with granted access, and all business practices and international relations, when it is convenient, are interpreted solely in the interests of this power. They essentially work in one direction in a zero-sum game. A world built on a doctrine of this kind is definitely unstable. After declaring victory in the Cold War, the United States proclaimed itself to be God's messenger on Earth, without any obligations and only interests which were declared sacred. They seem to ignore the fact that in the past decades, new powerful and increasingly assertive centres have been formed. Each of them develops its own political system and public institutions according to its own model of economic growth and, naturally, has the right to protect them and to secure national sovereignty. These are objective processes and genuinely revolutionary tectonic shifts in geopolitics, the global economy and technology, in the entire system of international relations, where the role of dynamic and potentially strong countries and regions is substantially growing. It is no longer possible to ignore their interests. To reiterate, these changes are fundamental, groundbreaking and rigorous. It would be a mistake to assume that at a time of turbulent change, one can simply sit it out or wait it out until everything gets back on track and becomes what it was before. It will not. However, the ruling elite of some Western states seem to be harbouring this kind of illusions. They refuse to notice obvious things, stubbornly clinging to the shadows of the past. For example, they seem to believe that the dominance of the West in global politics and the economy is an unchanging, eternal value. Nothing lasts forever. Our colleagues are not just denying reality. More than that; they are trying to reverse the course of history. They seem to think in terms of the past century. They are still influenced by their own misconceptions about countries outside the so-called ""golden billion"": they consider everything a backwater, or their backyard. They still treat them like colonies, and the people living there, like second-class people, because they consider themselves exceptional. If they are exceptional, that means everyone else is second rate. Thereby, the irrepressible urge to punish, to economically crush anyone who does not fit with the mainstream, does not want to blindly obey. Moreover, they crudely and shamelessly impose their ethics, their views on culture and ideas about history, sometimes questioning the sovereignty and integrity of states, and threatening their very existence. Suffice it to recall what happened in Yugoslavia, Syria, Libya and Iraq. If some ""rebel"" state cannot be suppressed or pacified, they try to isolate that state, or ""cancel"" it, to use their modern term. Everything goes, even sports, the Olympics, bans on culture and art masterpieces just because their creators come from the ""wrong"" country. This is the nature of the current round of Russophobia in the West, and the insane sanctions against Russia. They are crazy and, I would say, thoughtless. They are unprecedented in the number of them or the pace the West churns them out at. The idea was clear as day – they expected to suddenly and violently crush the Russian economy, to hit Russia's industry, finance, and people's living standards by destroying business chains, forcibly recalling Western companies from the Russian market, and freezing Russian assets. This did not work. Obviously, it did not work out; it did not happen. Russian entrepreneurs and authorities have acted in a collected and professional manner, and Russians have shown solidarity and responsibility. Step by step, we will normalise the economic situation. We have stabilised the financial markets, the banking system and the trade network. Now we are busy saturating the economy with liquidity and working capital to maintain the stable operation of enterprises and companies, employment and jobs. The dire forecasts for the prospects of the Russian economy, which were made in early spring, have not materialised. It is clear why this propaganda campaign was fuelled and all the predictions of the dollar at 200 rubles and the collapse of our economy were made. This was and remains an instrument in an information struggle and a factor of psychological influence on Russian society and domestic business circles. Incidentally, some of our analysts gave in to this external pressure and based their forecasts on the inevitable collapse of the Russian economy and a critical weakening of the national currency – the ruble. Real life has belied these predictions. However, I would like to emphasise that to continue being successful, we must be explicitly honest and realistic in assessing the situation, be independent in reaching conclusions, and of course, have a can-do spirit, which is very important. We are strong people and can deal with any challenge. Like our predecessors, we can resolve any task. The entire thousand-year history of our country bears this out. Within just three months of the massive package of sanctions, we have suppressed inflation rate spikes. As you know, after peaking at 17.8 percent, inflation now stands at 16.7 percent and continues dropping. This economic dynamic is being stabilised, and state finances are now sustainable. I will compare this to other regions further on. Yes, even this figure is too much for us – 16.7 percent is high inflation. We must and will work on this and, I am sure, we will achieve a positive result. After the first five months of this year, the federal budget has a surplus of 1.5 trillion rubles and the consolidated budget – a surplus of 3.3 trillion rubles. In May alone, the federal budget surplus reached almost half a trillion rubles, surpassing the figure for May 2021 more than four times over. Today, our job us to create conditions for building up production and increasing supply in the domestic market, as well as restoring demand and bank financing in the economy commensurately with the growth in supply. I mentioned that we have taken measures to reestablish the floating assets of companies. In most sectors, businesses have received the right to suspend insurance premiums for the second quarter of the year. Industrial companies have even more opportunities – they will be able to delay them through the third quarter as well. In effect, this is like getting an interest-free loan from the state. In the future, companies will not have to pay delayed insurance premiums in a single payment. They will be able to pay them in equal installments over 12 months, starting in June next year. Next. As of May the subsidised mortgage rate has been reduced. It is now 9 percent, while the programme has been extended till the end of the year. As I have mentioned, the programme is aimed at helping Russians improve their housing situation, while supporting the home building industry and related industries that employ millions of people. Following a spike this spring, interest rates have been gradually coming down, as the Central Bank lowers the key rate. I believe that that this allows the subsidised mortgage rate to be further cut to 7 percent. What is important here? The programme will last until the end of the year without change. It means that our fellow Russians seeking to improve their living conditions should take advantage of the subsidy before the end of the year. The lending cap will not change either, at 12 million roubles for Moscow and St Petersburg and 6 million for the rest of Russia. I should add that we must make long-term loans for businesses more accessible. The focus must shift from budget subsidies for businesses to bank lending as a means to spur business activity. We need to support this. We will allocate 120 billion rubles from the National Wealth Fund to build up the capacity of the VEB Project Financing Factory. This will provide for additional lending to much-needed initiatives and projects worth around half a trillion roubles. Colleagues, Once again, the economic blitzkrieg against Russia was doomed to fail from the beginning. Sanctions as a weapon have proved in recent years to be a double-edged sword damaging their advocates and architects just a much, if not more. I am not talking about the repercussions we see clearly today. We know that European leaders informally, so to say, furtively, discuss the very concerning possibility of sanctions being levelled not at Russia, but at any undesirable nation, and ultimately anyone including the EU and European companies. So far this is not the case, but European politicians have already dealt their economies a serious blow all by themselves. We see social and economic problems worsening in Europe, and in the US as well, food, electricity and fuel prices rising, with quality of life in Europe falling and companies losing their market edge. According to experts, the EU's direct, calculable losses from the sanctions fever could exceed $400 billion this year. This is the price of the decisions that are far removed from reality and contradict common sense. These outlays fall directly on the shoulders of people and companies in the EU. The inflation rate in some Eurozone countries has exceeded 20 percent. I mentioned inflation in Russia, but the Eurozone countries are not conducting special military operations, yet the inflation rate in some of them has reached 20 percent. Inflation in the United States is also unacceptable, the highest in the past 40 years. Of course, inflation in Russia is also in the double digits so far. However, we have adjusted social benefits and pensions to inflation, and increased the minimum and subsistence wages, thereby protecting the most vulnerable groups of the population. At the same time, high interest rates have helped people keep their savings in the Russian banking system. Businesspeople know, of course, that a high key rate clearly slows economic development. But it is a boon for the people in most cases. They have reinvested a substantial amount of money in banks due to higher interest rates. This is our main difference from the EU countries, where rising inflation is directly reducing the real incomes of the people and eating up their savings, and the current manifestations of the crisis are affecting, above all, low-income groups. The growing outlays of European companies and the loss of the Russian market will have lasting negative effects. The obvious result of this will be the loss of global competitiveness and a system-wide decline in the European economies' pace of growth for years to come. Taken together, this will aggravate the deep-seated problems of European societies. Yes, we have many problems as well, yet I have to speak about Europe now because they are pointing the finger at us although they have enough of their own problems. I mentioned this at Davos. A direct result of the European politicians' actions and events this year will be the further growth of inequality in these countries, which will, in turn, split their societies still more, and the point at issue is not only the well-being but also the value orientation of various groups in these societies. Indeed, these differences are being suppressed and swept under the rug. Frankly, the democratic procedures and elections in Europe and the forces that come to power look like a front, because almost identical political parties come and go, while deep down things remain the same. The real interests of people and national businesses are being pushed further and further to the periphery. Such a disconnect from reality and the demands of society will inevitably lead to a surge in populism and extremist and radical movements, major socioeconomic changes, degradation and a change of elites in the short term. As you can see, traditional parties lose all the time. New entities are coming to the surface, but they have little chance for survival if they are not much different from the existing ones. The attempts to keep up appearances and the talk about allegedly acceptable costs in the name of pseudo-unity cannot hide the main thing: the European Union has lost its political sovereignty, and its bureaucratic elites are dancing to someone else's tune, doing everything they are told from on high and hurting their own people, economies, and businesses. There are other critically important matters here. The worsening of the global economic situation is not a recent development. I will now go over things that I believe are extremely important. What is happening now does not stem from what happened during recent months, of course not. Moreover, it is not the result of the special military operation carried out by Russia in Donbass. Saying so is an unconcealed, deliberate distortion of the facts. Surging inflation in product and commodity markets had become a fact of life long before the events of this year. The world has been driven into this situation, little by little, by many years of irresponsible macroeconomic policies pursued by the G7 countries, including uncontrolled emission and accumulation of unsecured debt. These processes intensified with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, when supply and demand for goods and services drastically fell on a global scale. This begs the question: what does our military operation in Donbass have to do with this? Nothing whatsoever. Because they could not or would not devise any other recipes, the governments of the leading Western economies simply accelerated their money-printing machines. Such a simple way to make up for unprecedented budget deficits. I have already cited this figure: over the past two years, the money supply in the United States has grown by more than 38 percent. Previously, a similar rise took decades, but now it grew by 38 percent or 5.9 trillion dollars in two years. By comparison, only a few countries have a bigger gross domestic product. The EU's money supply has also increased dramatically over this period. It grew by about 20 percent, or 2.5 trillion euros. Lately, I have been hearing more and more about the so-called – please excuse me, I really would not like to do this here, even mention my own name in this regard, but I cannot help it – we all hear about the so-called 'Putin inflation' in the West. When I see this, I wonder who they expect would buy this nonsense – people who cannot read or write, maybe. Anyone literate enough to read would understand what is actually happening. Russia, our actions to liberate Donbass have absolutely nothing to do with this. The rising prices, accelerating inflation, shortages of food and fuel, petrol, and problems in the energy sector are the result of system-wide errors the current US administration and European bureaucracy have made in their economic policies. That is where the reasons are, and only there. I will mention our operation, too: yes, it could have contributed to the trend, but the root cause is precisely this – their erroneous economic policies. In fact, the operation we launched in Donbass is a lifeline they are grabbing at to be able to blame their own miscalculations on others, in this case, on Russia. But everyone who has at least completed primary school would understand the true reasons for today's situation. So, they printed more money, and then what? Where did all that money go? It was obviously used to pay for goods and services outside Western countries – this is where the newly-printed money flowed. They literally began to clean out, to wipe out global markets. Naturally, no one thought about the interests of other states, including the poorest ones. They were left with scraps, as they say, and even that at exorbitant prices. While at the end of 2019, imports of goods to the United States amounted to about 250 billion dollars a month, by now, it has grown to 350 billion. It is noteworthy that the growth was 40 percent – exactly in proportion to the unsecured money supply printed in recent years. They printed and distributed money, and used it to wipe out goods from third countries' markets. This is what I would like to add. For a long time, the United States was a big food supplier in the world market. It was proud, and with good reason, of its achievements, its agriculture and farming traditions. By the way, this is an example for many of us, too. But today, America's role has changed drastically. It has turned from a net exporter of food into a net importer. Loosely speaking, it is printing money and pulling commodity flows its way, buying food products all over the world. The European Union is building up imports even faster. Obviously, such a sharp increase in demand that is not covered by the supply of goods has triggered a wave of shortages and global inflation. This is where this global inflation originates. In the past couple of years, practically everything – raw materials, consumer goods and particularly food products – has become more expensive all over the world. Yes, of course, these countries, including the United States continue importing goods, but the balance between exports and imports has been reversed. I believe imports exceed exports by some 17 billion. This is the whole problem. According to the UN, in February 2022, the food price index was 50 percent higher than in May 2020, while the composite raw materials index has doubled over this period. Under the cloud of inflation, many developing nations are asking a good question: why exchange goods for dollars and euros that are losing value right before our eyes? The conclusion suggests itself: the economy of mythical entities is inevitably being replaced by the economy of real values and assets. According to the IMF, global currency reserves are at $7.1 trillion and 2.5 trillion euros now. These reserves are devalued at an annual rate of about 8 percent. Moreover, they can be confiscated or stolen any time if the United States dislikes something in the policy of the states involved. I think this has become a very real threat for many countries that keep their gold and foreign exchange reserves in these currencies. According to analyst estimates, and this is an objective analysis, a conversion of global reserves will begin just because there is no room for them with such shortages. They will be converted from weakening currencies into real resources like food, energy commodities and other raw materials. Other countries will be doing this, of course. Obviously, this process will further fuel global dollar inflation. As for Europe, their failed energy policy, blindly staking everything on renewables and spot supplies of natural gas, which have caused energy price increases since the third quarter of last year – again, long before the operation in Donbass – have also exacerbated price hikes. We have absolutely nothing to do with this. It was due to their own actions that prices have gone through the roof, and now they are once again looking for somebody to blame. Not only did the West's miscalculations affect the net cost of goods and services but they also resulted in decreased fertiliser production, mainly nitrogen fertilisers made from natural gas. Overall, global fertiliser prices have jumped by over 70 percent from mid-2021 through February 2022. Unfortunately, there are currently no conditions that can overcome these pricing trends. On the contrary, aggravated by obstacles to the operation of Russian and Belarusian fertiliser producers and disrupted supply logistics, this situation is approaching a deadlock. It is not difficult to foresee coming developments. A shortage of fertiliser means a lower harvest and a higher risk of an undersupplied global food market. Prices will go even higher, which could lead to hunger in the poorest countries. And it will be fully on the conscience of the US administration and the European bureaucracy. I want to emphasise once again: this problem did not arise today or in the past three or four months. And certainly, it is not Russia's fault as some demagogues try to declare, shifting the responsibility for the current state of affairs in the world economy to our country. Maybe it would even be nice to hear that we are so powerful and omnipotent that we can blow up inflation in the West, in the United States and Europe, or that we can do things to throw everything into disorder. Maybe it would be nice to feel this power, if only there were truth in it. This situation has been brewing for years, spurred by the short-sighted actions of those who are used to solving their problems at somebody else's expense and who have relied and still rely on the mechanism of financial emission to outbid and draw trade flows, thus escalating deficits and provoking humanitarian disasters in certain regions of the world. I will add that this is essentially the same predatory colonial policy as in the past, but of course in a new iteration, a more subtle and sophisticated edition. You might not even recognise it at first. The current priority of the international community is to increase food deliveries to the global market, notably, to satisfy the requirements of the countries that need food most of all. While ensuring its domestic food security and supplying the domestic market, Russia is also able to scale up its food and fertiliser exports. For example, our grain exports in the next season can be increased to 50 million tonnes. As a priority, we will supply the countries that need food most of all, where the number of starving people could increase, first of all, African countries and the Middle East. At the same time, there will be problems there, and not through our fault either. Yes, on paper Russian grain, food and fertilisers… Incidentally, the Americans have adopted sanctions on our fertilisers, and the Europeans followed suit. Later, the Americans lifted them because they saw what this could lead to. But the Europeans have not backed off. Their bureaucracy is as slow as a flour mill in the 18th century. In other words, everyone knows that they have done a stupid thing, but they find it difficult to retrace their steps for bureaucratic reasons. As I have said, Russia is ready to contribute to balancing global markets of agricultural products, and we see that our UN colleagues, who are aware of the scale of the global food problem, are ready for dialogue. We could talk about creating normal logistical, financial and transport conditions for increasing Russian food and fertiliser exports. As for Ukrainian food supplies to global markets – I have to mention this because of numerous speculations – we are not hindering them. They can do it. We did not mine the Black Sea ports of Ukraine. They can clear the mines and resume food exports. We will ensure the safe navigation of civilian vessels. No problem. But what are we talking about? According to the US Department of Agriculture, the matter concerns 6 million tonnes of wheat (we estimate it at 5 million tonnes) and 7 million tonnes of maize. This is it, altogether. Since global production of wheat stands at 800 million tonnes, 5 million tonnes make little difference for the global market, as you can see. Anyway, Ukrainian grain can be exported, and not only via Black Sea ports. Another route is via Belarus, which is, incidentally, the cheapest way. Or via Poland or Romania, whichever you prefer. In fact, there are five or six export routes. The problem is not with us, the problem is with the adequacy of the people in control in Kiev. They can decide what to do, and, at least in this particular case, they should not take their lead from their foreign bosses, their masters across the ocean. But there is also the risk that grain will be used as payment for arms deliveries. This would be regrettable. Friends, Once again, the world is going through an era of drastic change. International institutions are breaking down and faltering. Security guarantees are being devalued. The West has made a point of refusing to honour its earlier commitments. It has simply been impossible to reach any new agreements with them. Given these circumstances and against the backdrop of mounting risks and threats, Russia was forced to go ahead with the special military operation. It was a difficult but necessary decision, and we were forced to make it. This was the decision of a sovereign country, which has еру unconditional right to uphold its security, which is based on the UN Charter. This decision was aimed at protecting our people and the residents of the people's republics of Donbass who for eight long years were subjected to genocide by the Kiev regime and the neo-Nazis who enjoyed the full protection of the West. The West not only sought to implement an ""anti-Russia"" scenario, but also engaged in the active military development of Ukrainian territory, flooding Ukraine with weapons and military advisers. And it continues to do so now. Frankly, no one is paying any attention to the economy or well-being of the people living there, they just do not care about it at all, but they have never spared money to create a NATO foothold in the east that is directed against Russia and to cultivate aggression, hatred and Russophobia. Today, our soldiers and officers, as well as the Donbass militia, are fighting to protect their people. They are fighting for Russia's future as a large, free and secure multiethnic country that makes its own decisions, determines its own future, relies on its history, culture and traditions, and rejects any and all outside attempts to impose pseudo-values steeped in dehumanisation and moral degradation. No doubt, our special military operation goals will be fulfilled. The key to this is the courage and heroism of our soldiers, consolidated Russian society, whose support gives strength and confidence to the Russian Army and Navy and a deep understanding of the truth and historical justice of our cause which is to build and strengthen Russia as a strong sovereign power. My point is that sovereignty cannot be segmented or fragmented in the 21st century. The components of sovereignty are equally important, and they reinvigorate and complement each other. So, what matters to us is not only the defence of our political sovereignty and national identity, but also strengthening everything that determines our country's economic, financial, professional and technological independence. The very structure of Western sanctions rested on the false premise that economically Russia is not sovereign and is critically vulnerable. They got so carried away spreading the myth of Russia's backwardness and its weak positions in the global economy and trade that apparently, they started believing it themselves. While planning their economic blitzkrieg, they did not notice, simply ignored the real facts of how much our country had changed in the past few years. These changes are the result of our planned efforts to create a sustainable macroeconomic structure, ensure food security, implement import substitution programmes and create our own payment system, to name a few. Of course, sanction restrictions created many challenges for the country. Some companies continue having problems with spare parts. Our companies have lost access to many technological solutions. Logistics are in disarray. But, on the other hand, all this opens up new opportunities for us – we often talk about this but it really is so. All this is an impetus to build an economy with full rather than partial technological, production, human and scientific potential and sovereignty. Naturally, it is impossible to resolve such a comprehensive challenge instantly. It is necessary to continue working systematically with an eye to the future. This is exactly what Russia is doing by implementing its long-term plans for the development of branches of the economy and strengthening the social sphere. The current trials are merely resulting in adjustments and modifications of the plans without changing their strategic orientation. Today, I would like to talk about the key principles on which our country, our economy will develop. The first principle is openness. Genuinely sovereign states are always interested in equal partnership and in contributing to global development. On the contrary, weak and dependent countries are usually looking for enemies, fuelling xenophobia or losing the last remnants of their identity and independence, blindly following in the wake of their suzerain. Russia will never follow the road of self-isolation and autarky although our so-called Western friends are literally dreaming about this. Moreover, we are expanding cooperation with all those who are interested in it, who want to work with us, and will continue to do so. There are many of them. I will not list them at this point. They make up the overwhelming majority of people on Earth. I will not list all these countries now. It is common knowledge. I will say nothing new when I remind you that everyone who wants to continue working or is working with Russia is subjected to blatant pressure from the United States and Europe; it goes as far as direct threats. However, this kind of blackmail means little when it comes to countries headed by true leaders who know the difference between their own national interests, the interests of their people – and someone else's. Russia will build up economic cooperation with these states and promote joint projects. At the same time, we will certainly continue to cooperate with Western companies that have remained in the Russian market despite the unprecedented arm-twisting – such companies exist, too. We believe the development of a convenient and independent payment infrastructure in national currencies is a solid and predictable basis for deepening international cooperation. To help companies from other countries develop logistical and cooperation ties, we are working to improve transport corridors, increase the capacity of railways, transshipment capacity at ports in the Arctic, and in the eastern, southern and other parts of the country, including in the Azov-Black Sea and Caspian basins – they will become the most important section of the North-South Corridor, which will provide stable connectivity with the Middle East and Southern Asia. We expect freight traffic along this route to begin growing steadily in the near future. But foreign trade is not our only priority. Russia intends to increase scientific, technological, cultural, humanitarian and sports cooperation based on equality and mutual respect between partners. At the same time, our country will strive for responsible leadership in all these areas. The second principle of our long-term development is a reliance on entrepreneurial freedom. Every private initiative aimed at benefiting Russia should receive maximum support and space for implementation. The pandemic and the more recent events have confirmed how important flexibility and freedom are in the economy. Russian private businesses – in tough conditions, amid attempts to restrain our development by any means – have proved they can compete in global markets. Private businesses should also be credited for Russia's adaptation to rapidly changing external conditions. Russia needs to ensure the dynamic development of the economy – naturally, relying on private business. We will continue to reduce administrative hurdles. For example, in 2016–2018, we imposed a moratorium on routine audits of small businesses. Subsequently, it was extended through 2022. In 2020, this moratorium was extended to cover mid-sized companies. Also, the number of unscheduled audits decreased approximately fourfold. We did not stop at that, and last March, we cancelled routine audits for all entrepreneurs, regardless of the size of their businesses, provided their activities do not put people or the environment at high risk. As a result, the number of routine audits has declined sixfold compared to last year. Why am I giving so many details? The point is that after the moratorium on audits was imposed, the number of violations by entrepreneurs – this was the result – has not increased, but rather it has gone down. This testifies to the maturity and responsibility of Russian businesses. Of course, they should be offered motivation rather than being forced to observe regulations and requirements. So, there is every reason to take another radical step forward, that is, to abandon, for good and on a permanent basis, the majority of audits for all Russian businesses, except on risky or potentially dangerous activities. Everyone has long since understood that there was no need to check on everyone without exception. A risk-oriented approach should be at work. I ask the Government to develop the specific parameters of such a reform in the next few months. There is another very sensitive topic for business, which has also become important today for our national security and economic resilience. To reduce and bring to a minimum all sorts of abuse and loopholes to exert pressure on entrepreneurs, we are consistently removing loose regulations from criminal law that are applied to economic crimes. Last March, a law was signed, under which tax-related criminal cases against entrepreneurs shall only be brought before a court by the tax service – there is no other way. Soon a draft law will be passed on reducing the statute of limitations for tax-related crimes and on rejecting lawsuits to initiate criminal proceedings after tax arrears have been paid off. Working comprehensively, although prudently, we need to decriminalise a wide range of economic offenses, for instance, those that punish businesses without a licence or accreditation. This is a controversial practice today because our Western partners illegitimately refuse to provide such licenses. Our own agencies must not single-handedly make our businesses criminally liable for actually doing nothing wrong. The problem is this, and small businesses understand it very well – if a licence has expired, and Western partners refuse to extend it, what are businesses to do, wrap up operations? By no means, let them work. State oversight should continue, but there should be no undue interference in business. It also makes sense to think about raising the threshold of criminal liability for unpaid customs duties and other such taxes. Additionally, we have not for a long time reconsidered the parameters of the terms 'large' and 'very large' economic loss for the purposes of economic offences despite inflation accruing 50 percent since 2016. The law now fails to reflect the current realities and needs to be corrected. We need to reconsider the conditions for detaining entrepreneurs and for extending preliminary investigations. It is no secret that these practices have long been used inappropriately. Businesses have been forced to cease operations or go bankrupt even before the investigation is over. The reputation of the owners and of the brand name suffers as a result, not to mention the direct financial loss, loss of market share and jobs. I want to ask law enforcement to put an end to these practices. I also ask the Government and the Supreme Court to draft appropriate legislation before October 1 of this year. In addition, at the Security Council, a special instruction was given to look into criminal cases being opened without later proceeding to court. The number of such cases has grown in recent years. We know the reasons. A case is often opened without sufficient grounds or to put pressure on individuals. We will discuss this in autumn to take legislative action and change the way our law enforcement agencies work. It goes without saying that regional governments play a major role in creating a modern business environment. As is customary during the St Petersburg Forum, I highlight the regions that have made significant progress in the National Investment Climate Rankings compiled by the Agency for Strategic Initiatives. There have been changes in the top three. Moscow and Tatarstan have remained at the top and were joined by the Moscow Region which, in a span of one year, went from eighth place to the top three. The leaders of the rankings also include the Tula, Nizhny Novgorod, Tyumen, Novgorod, and Sakhalin regions, St Petersburg and Bashkortostan. Separately, I would like to highlight the regions that have made the greatest strides such as the Kurgan Region, which moved up 36 spots; the Perm Territory and the Altai Territory, up 26 spots; Ingushetia, up 24 spots; and the Ivanovo Region which moved up 17 spots. I want to thank and congratulate our colleagues in the regions for their good work. The federal government and regional and municipal governments should focus on supporting individual business initiatives in small towns and remote rural communities. We are aware of such stories of success. That includes developing popular software and marketing locally produced organic food and environmentally friendly products nationwide using domestic websites. It is important to create new opportunities, to introduce modern retail formats, including e-commerce platforms, as I mentioned above, and to cut the logistics, transportation and other costs, including by using upgraded Russian Post offices. It is also important to help small business employees, self-employed individuals and start-up entrepreneurs acquire additional skills and competencies. Please include corresponding measures tailored specifically to small towns and rural and remote areas as a separate line in the national project for promoting small and medium-sized businesses. Today I would like to address our officials, owners of large companies, our business leaders and executives. Colleagues, friends, Real, stable success and a sense of dignity and self-respect only come when you link your future and the future of your children with your Fatherland. We have maintained ties with many people for a long time, and I am aware of the sentiments of many of the heads and owners of our companies. You have told me many times that business is much more than just making a profit, and I fully agree. It is about changing life around you, contributing to the development of your home cities, regions and the country as a whole, which is extremely important for self-fulfilment. There is nothing like serving the people and society. This is the meaning of your life and work. Recent events have reaffirmed what I have always said: it is much better at home. Those who refused to hear that clear message have lost hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars in the West, in what looked like a safe haven for their assets. I would like to once again say the following to our colleagues, those who are both in this audience and those who are not here: please, do not fall into the same trap again. Our country has huge potential, and there are more than enough tasks that need your contribution. Invest here, in the creation of new enterprises and jobs, in the development of the tourism infrastructure, support schools, universities, healthcare and the social sphere, culture and sport. I know that many of you are doing this. I know this, but I wanted to say it again. This is how the Bakhrushin, Morozov, Shchukin, Ryabushinsky, Akchurin, Galeyev, Apanayev, Matsiyev, Mamontov, Tretyakov, Arsanov, Dadashev and Gadzhiyev families understood their noble mission. Many Russian, Tatar, Buryat, Chechen, Daghestani, Yakutian, Ossetian, Jewish, Armenian and other merchant and entrepreneurial families did not deprive their heirs of their due share, and at the same time they etched their names in the history of our country. Incidentally, I would like to note once again that it remains to be seen what is more important for potential heirs: money and property or their forefathers' good name and service to the country. The latter is something that cannot be squandered or, pardon my language, wasted on drink. A good name is something that will always belong to your descendants, to future generations. It will always be part of their lives, going from one generation to another, helping them and making them stronger than the money or property they might inherit can make them. Colleagues, A responsible and well-balanced macroeconomic policy is the third guiding principle of our long-term development. In fact, this policy has largely enabled us to withstand the unprecedented pressure brought on by sanctions. Let me reiterate that this is an essential policy in the long term, not just for responding to the current challenges. We will not follow in the footsteps of our Western colleagues by replicating their bitter experience setting off an inflation spiral and disrupting their finances. Our goal is to ensure robust economic growth for years to come, reducing the inflation burden on our people and businesses and achieving the mid- and long-term target inflation rate of four percent. Inflation was one of the first things I mentioned during my remarks, so let me tell you this: we remain committed to this target of a four-percent inflation rate. I have already instructed the Government to draft proposals regarding the new budget guidelines. They must ensure that our budget policy is predictable and enables us to make the best use of the external economic conditions. Why do we need all this? To put economic growth on a more stable footing, while also delivering on our infrastructure and technological objectives, which provide a foundation for improving the wellbeing of our people. True, some international reserve currencies have set themselves on a suicidal path lately, which is an obvious fact. In any case, they clearly have suicidal intentions. Of course, using them to 'sterilise' our money supply does not make any sense. Still, the principle of planning one's spending based on how much you earn remains relevant. This is how it works, and we understand this. Social justice is the fourth principle underpinning our development. There must be a powerful social dimension when it comes to promoting economic growth and business initiatives. This development model must reduce inequality instead of deepening it, unlike what is happening in other countries. To be honest, we have not been at the forefront when it comes to delivering on these objectives. We have yet to resolve many issues and problems in this regard. Reducing poverty and inequality is all about creating demand for Russian-made products across the country, bridging the gap between regions in terms of their capabilities, and creating new jobs where they are needed the most. These are the core economic development drivers. Let me emphasise that generating positive momentum in terms of household income growth and poverty reduction are the main performance indicators for government agencies and the state in general. We need to achieve tangible results in this sphere already this year, despite all the objective challenges we face. I have already assigned this task to the Government. Again, we provide targeted support to the most vulnerable groups – pensioners, families with children, and people in difficult life situations. Pensions are indexed annually at a rate higher than inflation. This year, they have been raised twice, including by another 10 percent on June 1. The minimum wage was also increased by 10 percent at the same time, and so was the subsistence minimum – a reference figure used to calculate many social benefits and payments – accordingly, these benefits should also grow, increasing the incomes of about 15 million people. In recent years, we have built a holistic system to support low-income families with children. Women are entitled to state support from the early stages of pregnancy and until the child reaches the age of 17. People's living standards and prosperity are the most important demographic factors; the current situation is quite challenging due to several negative demographic waves that have recently overlapped. In April, less than a hundred thousand children were born in Russia, almost 13 percent less than in April 2020. I ask the Government to continue to keep the development of additional support measures for families with children under review. They must be far-reaching and commensurate with the magnitude of the extraordinary demographic challenge we are facing. Russia's future is ensured by families with two, three and more children. Therefore, we need to do more than provide direct financial support – we need to target and direct the healthcare system, education, and all areas that determine the quality of people's lives towards the needs of families with children. This problem is addressed, among other approaches, by the national social initiatives, which regional teams and the Agency for Strategic Initiatives are implementing together. This autumn, we will assess the results of their work, review and rank the Russian regions by quality of life in order to apply the best experiences and practices as widely as possible throughout the country. Prioritising the development of infrastructure is the fifth principle underlying Russia's economic policy. We have scaled up direct budget spending on expanding transport corridors. An ambitious plan for building and repairing the federal and regional motorway core network will be launched next year. At least 85 percent of the roads are to be brought up to code within the next five years. Infrastructure budget lending is a new tool that is being widely used. The loans are issued for 15 years at a 3 percent APR. As I mentioned before, they are much more popular than we originally thought. The regions have multiple well-thought-out and promising projects that should be launched at the earliest convenience. We will look into how we can use this support measure. We debated this issue last night. What I am saying is that it is a reliable tool. Upgrading housing and utilities services is a separate matter with a backlog of issues. The industry is chronically underinvested to the tune of 4.5 trillion rubles. Over 40 percent of networks need to be replaced, which accounts for their low efficiency and big losses. About 3 percent of the networks become unusable every year, but no more than 2 percent get replaced, which makes the problem even worse every single year. I propose consolidating resources and launching a comprehensive programme for upgrading housing and utilities, and synchronizing it with other infrastructure development and housing overhaul plans. The goal is to turn the situation around and to gradually reduce the number of dated networks, just like we are doing by relocating people from structurally unsafe buildings or fixing roads. We will discuss in detail housing and utilities and the construction complex with the governors at a State Council Presidium meeting next week. On a separate note, I propose increasing resources to fund projects to create a comfortable urban environment in small towns and historical settlements. This programme is working well for us. I propose allocating another 10 billion rubles annually for these purposes in 2023–2024. We will allocate additional funds for renovating urban areas in the Far Eastern Federal District. I want the Government to allocate dedicated funds to this end as part of the programmes for infrastructure budget lending and housing and utilities upgrading, as well as other development programmes. Promoting comprehensive improvements and development for rural areas is a top priority for us. People who live there are feeding the country. We now see that they are also feeding a major part of the world, so they must live in comfort and dignity. In this connection, I am asking the Government to allocate additional funding for the corresponding programme. Export duties on agricultural produce can serve as a source of funding here. This is a permanent source of revenue. Of course, there can be fluctuations, but at least this ensures a constant flow of revenue. On a separate note, I suggest that we expand the programmes for upgrading and modernising rural cultural centres, as well as regional theatres and museums by allocating six billion rubles for each of these projects in 2023 and 2024. What I have just said about cultural institutions is something that people are really looking forward to, something they really care about. Let me give you a recent example: during the presentation of the Hero of Labour medals, one of the winners, Vladimir Mikhailov from Yakutia, asked me directly for help with building a cultural centre in his native village. This was during the part of the ceremony where we meet behind closed doors. We will definitely do this. The fact that people are raising this issue at all levels shows that they are really eager to see these projects implemented. At this point, I would like to make a sidenote on a topic that is especially relevant now, since we are in early summer, when Russians usually take their summer vacations. Every year, more and more tourists want to visit the most beautiful corners of our country: national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and nature reserves. According to available estimates, this year this tourist flow is expected to exceed 12 million people. It is essential that all government bodies, businesses and tourists are well aware of what they can and cannot do in these territories, where they can build tourism infrastructure, and where such activity is strictly prohibited because it endangers unique and fragile ecosystems. The draft law governing tourism in special protected territories and regulating this activity in a civilised manner is already in the State Duma. In this context, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that we must figure out in advance all the relevant estimates and ensure that the decisions are well-balanced. We need to be serious about this. I would like to place special emphasis on the need to preserve Lake Baikal. In particular, there is a comprehensive development project for the city of Baikalsk, which must become a model of sustainable, eco-sensitive municipal governance. This is not just about getting rid of the accumulated negative environmental impacts from the Baikalsk Pulp and Paper Mill, but about setting a higher standard of living for the city and transforming it into a signature destination for environmental tourism in Russia. We need to rely on the most cutting-edge technologies and clean energy when carrying out this project. Overall, we will be developing clean technology to achieve the goals we set in the environmental modernisation of production facilities, and to reduce hazardous emissions, especially in large industrial centres. We will also continue working on closed-loop economy projects, green projects and climate preservation. I spoke about these issues in detail at this forum last year. Consequently, the sixth cross-cutting development principle that consolidates our work is, in my opinion, achieving genuine technological sovereignty, creating an integral system of economic development that does not depend on foreign institutions when it comes to critically important components. We need to develop all areas of life on a qualitatively new technological level without being simply users of other countries' solutions. We must have technological keys to developing next-generation goods and services. In the past years, we have focused a lot of attention on import substitution, succeeding in a range of industries, including agriculture, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, defence production and several others. But I should stress that there is a lot of discussion in our society about import substitution. And it is not a cure-all nor a comprehensive solution. If we only imitate others when trying to replace foreign goods with copies, even if very high-quality ones, we may end up constantly playing catch-up while we should be one step ahead and create our own competitive technologies, goods and services that can become new global standards. If you remember, Sergei Korolyov did not just copy or locally upgrade captured rocket technology. He focused on the future and proposed a unique plan to develop the R-7 rocket. He paved the path to space for humankind and in fact set a standard for the entire world, for decades ahead. Proactively – this is how founders of many Soviet research programmes worked at the time. And today, building on that groundwork, our designers continue to make progress and show their worth. It is thanks to them that Russia has supersonic weapons that do not exist in any other country. Rosatom remains the leader in nuclear technology, developing our fleet of nuclear-powered icebreakers. Many Russian AI and Big Data solutions are the best in the world. To reiterate, technological development is a cross-cutting area that will define the current decade and the entire 21st century. We will review in depth our approaches to building a groundbreaking technology-based economy – a techno economy – at the upcoming Strategic Development Council meeting. There is so much we can discuss. Most importantly, many managerial decisions must be made in the sphere of engineering education and transferring research to the real economy, and the provision of financial resources for fast-growing high-tech companies. We will also discuss the development of cross-cutting technologies and progress of digital transformation projects in individual industries. To be clear, of course it is impossible to make every product out there, and there is no need for that. However, we need to possess critical technologies in order to be able to move swiftly should we need to start our own production of any product. This is what we did when we quickly started making coronavirus vaccines, and most recently launched the production of many other products and services. For example, after dishonest KamAZ partners left the Russian market, their place was taken by domestic companies, which are supplying parts for traditional models and even advanced mainline, transport and heavy-duty vehicles. The Mir card payment system has successfully replaced Visa and MasterCard on the domestic market. It is expanding its geography and gradually gaining international recognition. The St Petersburg Tractor Plant is another case in point. Its former foreign partner stopped selling engines and providing warranty maintenance. Engine builders from Yaroslavl and Tutayev came to the rescue and started supplying their engines. As a result, the output of agricultural equipment at the St Petersburg Tractor Plant hit a record high in March-April. It did not decrease, but hit an all-time high. I am sure there will be more positive practices and success stories. To reiterate, Russia possesses the professional, scientific and technological potential to develop products that enjoy high demand, including household appliances and construction equipment, as well as industrial and service equipment. Today's task is to scale up the capacities and promptly get the necessary lines up and running. One of the key issues is comfortable work conditions for the businesses as well as the availability of prepared production sites. I ask the Government to submit key parameters of the new operating guidelines for industrial clusters by the autumn. What is critical here? First – financing. The projects launched in these clusters must have a long-term credit resource for up to ten years at an annual interest rate below seven percent in rubles. We have discussed all these issues with our economic agencies as well. Everyone agreed, so we will proceed. Second – taxation. The clusters must have a low level of relatively permanent taxes including insurance contributions. Third – supporting production at the early, kick-off stage, forming a package of orders including subsidising the purchases of ready products by such enterprises. This is not an easy issue but I think subsidies may be required. They are needed to ensure the market. We just have to work it out. Fourth – simplified administration including minimal or no inspections as well as convenient customs monitoring that is not burdensome. Fifth, and probably the most important – we need to set up mechanisms of guaranteed long-term demand for the new innovative products that are about to enter the market. I remind the Government that such preferential terms and respective industrial clusters must be launched as early as January 1, 2023. On a related note, I want to say that both new and already operating points of industrial growth must attract small businesses and engage them in their orbit. It is crucial for entrepreneurs, for small entities to see the horizon and grasp their prospects. Therefore, I ask the Government together with the SME Corporation [Federal Corporation for the Development of Small and Medium Enterprises] and our biggest companies to launch an instrument for long-term contracts between companies with state participation and SMEs. This will ensure demand for the products of such enterprises for years ahead whereas suppliers can confidently undertake commitments to launch a new manufacturing facility or expand an existing one to meet that order. Let me add that we have substantially shortened the timeframe for building industrial sites and eliminated all the unnecessary burdensome procedures. Still, there is much more we can do here. We have things to work on, and places to go from here. For example, building an industrial facility from the ground up takes anywhere from eighteen months to three years, while the persistently high interest rates make it harder to buy suitable land plots. Given this, I suggest launching industrial mortgages as a new tool for empowering Russian businesses to quickly start making all the products we need. What I mean are preferential long-term loans at a five-percent interest rate. Companies planning to buy new manufacturing space will be entitled to these loans. I am asking the Government to work out all the details with the Russian banking sector so that the industrial mortgage programme becomes fully operational soon. Friends, Changes in the global economy, finances and international relations are unfolding at an ever-growing pace and scale. There is an increasingly pronounced trend in favour of a multipolar growth model in lieu of globalisation. Of course, building and shaping a new world order is no easy task. We will have to confront many challenges, risks, and factors that we can hardly predict or anticipate today. Still, it is obvious that it is up to the strong sovereign states, those that do not follow a trajectory imposed by others, to set the rules governing the new world order. Only powerful and sovereign states can have their say in this emerging world order. Otherwise, they are doomed to become or remain colonies devoid of any rights. We need to move forward and change in keeping with the times, while demonstrating our national will and resolve. Russia enters this nascent era as a powerful sovereign nation. We will definitely use the new immense opportunities that are opening up for us in this day and age in order to become even stronger. Thank you for your attention. Margarita Simonyan: Thank you, Mr President. I would very much like to say that after such exhaustive remarks and such an exhaustive analysis, we have nothing left to talk about, because you have answered all the questions. Still, some questions remain, and we will certainly ask them. And now I would like to ask President Tokayev to come over here and share with us his perspective on the processes taking place in his country, in our country, and in relations between our countries and in the world. Thank you. President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: President Putin, forum participants, I congratulate everyone on a significant event – the 25th St Petersburg International Economic Forum. I thank President Putin for the invitation and for the warm and cordial welcome in the cultural capital of Russia. Over the past quarter of a century, the St Petersburg Forum has deservedly gained respect as a prestigious expert platform and occupies a worthy place among other world discussion platforms. Today, we are meeting in rather extraordinary circumstances – I am referring to the elevated political and economic turbulence. The global upheavals caused by the pandemic and the rising geopolitical tensions have led to a new reality. Globalisation has given way to an era of regionalisation, with all its inherent advantages and disadvantages. Be that as it may, the process of reformatting traditional economic models and trade routes is accelerating. The world is changing rapidly – unfortunately, in most cases it is not for the better. Inflation in many countries is breaking ten-year records, global economic growth is slowing down, and competition for investment and resources is intensifying. There are constraining factors for economic growth such as climate change, growing migration flows, and faster technological change. We certainly pay attention to these processes. Speaking about the new reality, it is important to bear in mind the rapidly changing structure of the international order – even the seemingly stable East-West, North-South vectors of interaction are shifting. It is important for the countries in our region not only to find the right answers to all these challenges, but also to try to make the most of them. Therefore, we have to consistently reach our full potential for cooperation within the Eurasian Economic Union. The project to link Eurasian integration with China's One Belt, One Road initiative is relevant here. As you know, Kazakhstan is now implementing large-scale political and economic reforms. Their goal is to reset public administration and build a fair, new Kazakhstan. We are working to ensure that there is a correlation between economic growth and rising living standards for our people. We want to achieve sustainable development of trade and economic ties, open new production lines, support the growth of human capital, and make investments. As part of our large-scale effort to modernise the country, we are drafting new rules of the game in the economy without glaring monopolies and rampant corruption. Our priority is to support businesses and improve the business climate with a view to providing the utmost protection for the rights of investors, and promoting stability and predictability. We will continue meeting all of our commitments to our traditional partners. Kazakhstan will continue building an inclusive, fair society without social inequality. I believe that to ensure sustainable development of all countries of the region, it is necessary to determine new horizons of cooperation and create new growth points in our economies. Along with this, we must always remember the very important task of ensuring international and regional security. In this context, I would like to draw your attention to the following points. The first task, as I have already mentioned, is to strengthen the capacity of the Eurasian Economic Union. This task remains relevant for us. The aggregate size of the economies of its members exceeds $2 trillion. This is an enormous market with free movement of goods, capital, services and workforce. At any rate, this is what it should be. Despite the pandemic and geopolitical upheavals, cooperation in the EAEU continues to grow stronger. Last year, its trade reached a record $73 billion, which is a third higher than last year. Russia has been and remains Kazakhstan's key economic partner in the EAEU. Last year, our trade went up by almost a third to exceed $24 billion. These are record figures for us. The dynamics remains positive this year as well. Our trade increased by over 12 percent in the first quarter of 2022. I believe that, considering the new reality, it would be appropriate and useful to develop an innovative trade strategy within the Eurasian Economic Union. Instead of imposing counter-sanctions, which, frankly, are unlikely to be productive, a more proactive and flexible trade policy should be pursued covering the Asian and the Middle Eastern markets. Kazakhstan could be instrumental in its role of a buffer market. Overall, the ultimate success of Eurasian integration largely, if not massively, depends on our effective common trade strategy. Kazakhstan and Russia can break new ground in industrial cooperation. We have a special plan, a programme for industrial cooperation in the new circumstances. Investors from Russia will be provided with industrial sites complete with infrastructure, and a favourable investment climate will be created for them. As a matter of fact, this is already being done. The full unlocking of our countries' agricultural potential is particularly important in these circumstances. According to the FAO [the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations], Russia and Kazakhstan are global leaders in terms of available agricultural land. This fact is of particular importance in light of declining global food security. According to the UN, the number of malnourished people will go from 270 million to 323 million this year. Providing people with high-quality and safe food remains a priority and a factor in maintaining internal stability. To create a reliable food system, it is important to implement innovative solutions and advanced technologies, as well as to cut food losses. Approaches to ensuring food security should be developed at the national level and within regional associations, including the EAEU with account taken of the interests of all state participants. Achieving declared goals in this extremely important area is unlikely without coordinated work. In other words, fighting skyrocketing inflation and food shortages is our common challenge, which will remain a priority in the foreseeable future, because it directly concerns the well-being of our people. Our countries' potential makes it possible to consistently and fully supply our markets with the necessary foods, as the President of Russia convincingly demonstrated today. Secondly, I believe that it is essential that we continue expanding trade and economic cooperation with third countries. Kazakhstan is proactively involved in integration processes, and has always stood for mutually beneficial cooperation with other international organisations. As far as I know, there has been much interest on the sidelines of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum in Russia's initiative to build a Greater Eurasian Partnership. This concept consists of offering regional organisations a platform for creating a common space of equal cooperation. It is for this reason that Kazakhstan continues to have a positive outlook on the effort to build the Greater Eurasian Partnership. This year, Kazakhstan chairs the Commonwealth of Independent States. Over the years, this structure has built up a positive track record despite all the geopolitical challenges, which proves that multilateral dialogue tools are effective. I believe that the CIS is perfectly suited for serving as a foundation for this megaproject. I am referring to Greater Eurasia, or the Greater Eurasian Partnership. It can encompass the SCO, ASEAN, and the Eurasian Economic Union as its integral elements. Over the next decade, China, India, as well as countries in the Middle East, South and Southeast Asia, which have traditionally been friendly to us, can become major investors in the economies of our region. China has already emerged as Kazakhstan's main economic and foreign trade partner. This country invested in our economy more than $22 billion over the past 15 years. For this reason, strengthening our multilateral cooperation with China is a very important goal for our country. Of course, the economy matters today just as much as political considerations. I believe that we have to promote business-to-business ties and build new transport and logistics corridors. Today, we treat these matters as our top priorities when meeting with people from Russia and other interested nations. There is a lot of potential for combining our efforts to develop a pool of breakthrough innovation and technology projects, as well as uninterrupted transportation and logistics chains. At the end of the day, this will create new economic growth opportunities for our countries. Thirdly, Kazakhstan maintains its unwavering commitment to international efforts to combat climate change. We will be consistent in our efforts to promote green investment and carry out corresponding projects. Environmental problems are global in nature, affecting almost all countries without exception, including Kazakhstan. Last year, our farmers had serious problems due to a draught that was triggered by low rainfall and low water level in rivers. The cross-border Ural River is in critical condition. We call it Zhayyq on our territory. I believe we should tackle such problems together when faced with such long-term challenges to the sustainable development of our states. I think we should give serious thought to the prospects of introducing the principles of closed-loop or circular economy. We are working to reduce the GDP's energy-output ratio, expand the renewable energy sector and reduce transit losses in this area. The similarity of our economies, industrial infrastructure ties between our two countries and geography as such are prompting us to pool efforts in this strategically important area as well. I hope that together we will manage to draft effective approaches and specific measures for tangible progress in this field. Fourthly. High quality human resources and constructive inter-cultural dialogue are a reliable source of economic growth. As part of the UN-proclaimed International Decade for the Rapprochement of Cultures, we will continue our policy of preserving the cultural diversity of our country and promoting international dialogue between civilisations. In September our capital will host yet another congress of world and traditional religions. We welcome the participation of religious figures from Russia in this forum. Practically all of them confirmed their participation. Kazakhstan is actively reformatting the system of its higher education with the participation of leading foreign universities, including Russian ones. The deepening of international academic ties has special significance for promoting the traditions of bilateral cooperation. I am convinced that the successful implementation of a number of joint educational and cultural initiatives will allow us to make a tangible contribution to the steady economic advance of our country. Participants of the forum, Kazakhstan proceeds from its firm conviction that Eurasia is our common home and that all countries on our continent should closely cooperate in the community. We are confident that the building of a peaceful, stable and economically strong Eurasia will become a major factor of sustainable development and inclusive growth on a global scale. I am convinced that this prestigious discussion venue that unites top class experts has great potential in searching for constructive ideas aimed at normalising the international situation and recovering the positive dynamics of the world economy. Thank you for your attention. Margarita Simonyan: Thank you very much, President Tokayev. Eurasia is indeed our common home. We all want this home to be safe and prosperous through God's help and our mutual efforts. And now we will turn to Africa. We have a video address from President of Egypt Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Can we have it on the screens, please? Thank you. President of Egypt Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful, President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin, Ladies and gentlemen, At the outset, allow me to extend to His Excellency, President Vladimir Putin, my sincere congratulations on the silver jubilee of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. Since 1997, when it has been held for the first time, the forum has become a leading platform for the business community and a remarkable economic event that seeks to discuss the key economic issues facing emerging markets and the world. Ladies and gentlemen, The Arab Republic of Egypt, as a guest country, will be part of this year's session of the forum, which marks the 25th anniversary of its launch, thus confirming the distinguished level that Egyptian-Russian economic relations have reached over the recent years. This year's forum is being held amid unprecedented political and economic challenges of a strategic nature. We hope that the outcomes of the forum will contribute to finding effective solutions to these challenges in a way that mitigates the impact of the global economic crisis and its negative repercussions on many countries in the world, especially the economies of emerging countries, takes the concerns and interests of all parties into account, and achieves the security and tranquility of peoples. This would be achieved through long-term political understandings that open the way for the growth of the global economy, especially in the wake of the severe coronavirus pandemic, which has cost our societies many victims and considerable money and resources, thus making us keen to avoid any slowdown in the global economy. Ladies and gentlemen, Let me use this opportunity to reiterate that the Arab Republic of Egypt values its firm, historic friendship relations with the Russian Federation, and values the tangible progress the two countries' relations have been witnessing over the past years in a multitude of vital sectors, for the two countries' economies and the prosperity of the two peoples. The Arab Republic of Egypt and the Russian Federation have been engaged over the past years in the implementation of mega and ambitious projects that serve our countries and respond to the aspirations of our peoples to realise more economic progress. The most prominent of these are: the project for the establishment of the Dabaa nuclear power plant, which comes within the context of the Egyptian State's strategy to expand national projects for the use of new and renewable sources of energy. Another project is the establishment of the Russian Industrial Zone in the Economic Zone of the Suez Canal, which is meant to become an important platform for industry in Africa. This is in addition to cooperation between the two countries to upgrade the Egyptian railway network and other joint ventures that realise the benefit of the two peoples. Ladies and gentlemen, You must be aware that the exceptional events that have been taking place in the Arab Republic of Egypt over the past decade had their immense impact on the overall economic situation in the country. The Egyptian people stood up to surmount this crisis by supporting a clear vision, based on investing in the Egyptian citizen and developing his capabilities. Therefore, Egypt Vision 2030 was launched to reflect the state's long-term strategic plan to achieve the principles and goals of sustainable development, with its economic, social and environmental dimensions. Based on this vision, the Government of Egypt has modernised its legislative structure to enable Egypt to attract more foreign investment. This qualified Egypt to become the top destination for attracting foreign investments in Africa and one of the few countries in the world capable of achieving a growth rate of up to 3.3 percent in 2021, despite the negative challenges posed by the spread of COVID-19 and their impact on the global economy. We expect the Egyptian economy to grow by 5.5% during the current fiscal year. The country's non-petroleum exports also increased during 2021 to reach $32 billion. Egypt has also succeeded, within the framework of its strategy to increase its capabilities, to implement mega agricultural projects that are aimed at increasing agricultural land by almost 2 million feddans. This is in addition to the mega projects Egypt is implementing in the fields of transport, by expanding thousands of kilometers of roads and upgrading Egypt's transport system by introducing new projects. Those include the high-speed rail that will constitute a means to link the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, thus boosting and facilitating international trade. Adding to this are the mega industrial projects and the numerous projects in the field of clean energy production, which have been established in Egypt at a rapid pace over the past period. Despite the previously-mentioned national efforts, Egypt's actions and efforts to achieve progress were hit recently by economic crises caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The world was partially recovering from its effects and repercussions, when it was hit again by a great economic crisis that cast a shadow over growth rates and negatively affected states' budgets, reflecting on the rise of fuel prices and the decline in the value of the national currencies in the face of hard currencies. This is in addition to the disruption in supply chains, the emergence of the food crisis, as well as the irregular movement of civil aviation. This sector is connected with vital fields of the Egyptian economy, primarily tourism and insurance. Addressing this crisis, which has an international character, requires international efforts and collaboration among all parties in order to get matters back to their normal state, particularly the movement of maritime traffic and the regularity of supply chains, particularly foodstuff, such as grain and vegetable oil. This also requires working toward restoring calm and stability at the international level, in order to mitigate the impact of this economic crisis on the peoples, who seek peace and development. I also call on all companies participating in this forum and others to take advantage of this huge opportunity that is provided by investing in Egypt in all fields. I would not miss, before concluding my speech, thanking the people of Saint Petersburg, this brave city throughout history, which at the same time represents an icon for culture and openness on the outside world. Finally, I would like, once again, to thank His Excellency, President Vladimir Putin, for his kind invitation for Egypt to participate in this forum as a guest of this round, wishing the forum and the participants all success and blessings and wishing our friendly countries more constructive cooperation, prosperity and progress. We pray God Almighty to spread peace and stability across the world and to spare our peoples the scourge of war and its economic and social impact by giving priority to the language of dialogue, understanding and co-existence. Thank you. Margarita Simonyan: We are grateful to the President of Egypt. I think that the people of the host city should be especially pleased to hear his warm words about St Petersburg. We have just a little time left before the discussion begins. They say anticipation increases desire. We will now listen to an address by President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping. President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping (retranslated): President Putin, ladies and gentlemen, friends, I am delighted to have this opportunity to address the plenary session of the 25th St Petersburg International Economic Forum, which I attended in person three years ago. In February this year, President Putin visited China and attended the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games in Beijing. We had a detailed exchange of views, following which we reached a vital agreement on expanding our comprehensive practical cooperation and implementing the concept of global governance based on joint consultations, joint participation and joint use. Cooperation between China and Russia is currently ascending in all spheres. Our bilateral trade reached $65.8 billion over the first five months of this year. We can expect to attain new records by year-end. This is evidence of the high resilience and ingenious potential of Chinese-Russian cooperation. The world is entering a new period of turbulence and transformation amid the ongoing radical changes and the coronavirus pandemic. There is an obvious trend of anti-globalism, a growing divide between the South and the North, and a weakening of cooperation drivers in the area of development, which could plunge the erratically reviving global economy into a deep recession and create unprecedented challenges to the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. According to ancient Chinese words of wisdom, a clever man sees a seed of crisis in every opportunity and an opportunity in every crisis. Danger and opportunity always go together. By overcoming danger, you get opportunity. Strength lies in confidence. The more there are difficulties, the more important it is to remain confident. During last year's session of the UN General Assembly, I proposed a Global Development Initiative, which was positively received and supported by a number of international organisations, including the UN, and about a hundred countries. Today, at a time when the international community is ever more interested in achieving more equitable, sustainable and secure development, we should seize opportunities, meet challenges head-on, and work on the implementation of the Global Development Initiative to build a shared future of peace and prosperity. First, we need to create conditions for development. It is important that we follow true multilateralism, respect and support all countries' pursuit of development paths suited to their national conditions, build an open world economy, and increase the representation and voice of emerging markets and developing countries in global economic governance with a view to making global development more balanced, coordinated and inclusive. Second, we need to strengthen development partnerships. It is important that we enhance North-South and South-South cooperation, pool cooperation resources, platforms and networks of development partnerships, and scale up development assistance in order to forge greater synergy for development and close the development gap. Third, we need to advance economic globalization. It is important that we enhance the coordination of development policies and international rules and standards, reject attempts at separation, supply disruption, unilateral sanctions and maximum pressure, remove trade barriers, keep global industrial and supply chains stable, tackle the worsening food and energy crises, and revive the world economy. Fourth, we need to pursue innovation-driven development. It is important that we unlock the potential of innovation-driven growth, improve the rules and institutional environment for innovation, break down barriers to the flow of innovation factors, deepen exchanges and cooperation on innovation, facilitate deeper integration of science and technology into the economy, and make sure the fruits of innovation are shared by all. Ladies and gentlemen, friends, The fundamentals of the Chinese economy are its strong resilience, enormous potential and long-term sustainability, which remain unchanged. We have full confidence in China's economic development. China will continue to promote high-quality development, promote openness with firm resolve, and pursue high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. China stands ready to work with Russia and all other countries to explore development prospects, share growth opportunities, and make new contributions to deepening global development cooperation and building a community with a shared future for mankind. Thank you. Margarita Simonyan: Thank you, Mr President. Coming to learn Chinese wisdom and some of Chinese sagacity is always a good thing, especially now that Chinese wisdom might come in useful for the entire world. Mr President, I would like to show you something that I have brought with me especially. It is juice, and it used to be so nicely coloured. It does not matter what sort of juice it is; you cannot even see the brand here, although it is a popular one. And now – do you see? A small picture and the rest is white. Why is that? And this is happening on a massive scale. Because we ran out of paint. The producer of paint for such packaging has left Russia, and the producer of the packaging also announced that they are leaving. I bought this two weeks ago, and soon this will disappear. As a result, we will have to pour it into bottles or three-litre glass jars, like it was in my childhood, unless we discover that we do not produce bottles either. There are conflicting opinions on this. You have touched upon this issue today. Some of the participants – a considerable part, maybe even the majority – came here by Sapsan trains. Some say ""We will swap Sapsans for Chinese trains, they are even better,"" since Siemens has gone. Others say ""We will learn to make them ourselves."" Let me remind you that we launched our own high-speed trains in 1984, I think they were called ER200. I was four years old, did not go to school yet, but we already had high-speed trains – but we do not have them any longer. It is sad, isn't it? And there are also people who say that no, we cannot replace all that, we can use Sapsan trains for another couple of years and then we will just give up high-speed railways, which means we will step back from what we got used to. And it is like this with everything: telephones, computers, everything we got used to. This is a very sad, I would even say heartbreaking plan. Maybe there is a different plan? Vladimir Putin: Whenever any decisions are taken, the key issues must be to singled out. What is key for us? Being independent, sovereign and ensuring future-oriented development both now and for the future generations? Or having packaging today? Unless we have sovereignty, we will soon have to buy everything and will only produce oil, gas, hemp fibre, saddles and sell rough logs abroad. It is inevitable. I have already said so in my speech: only sovereign countries can expect to have a sovereign future. That does not mean, however, that we need to plunge back into a situation of 30, 40 or 50 years ago. Regarding packaging. I do not think it is such a complicated thing that either our partners from other countries can replace, who will be pleased to occupy this market sooner or later, or we will be able to make ourselves. Margarita Simonyan: You do not see it, but President Tokayev is nodding his head: they will probably be able to replace it. Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: Absolutely, this is not a problem. Vladimir Putin: Of course, we will able to replace it. The question is about a totally different matter. We keep talking about import substitution. In my speech here I also said – and I will just add a couple of words so as not to take too much time while answering only one question. The issue is not about import substitution, the issue is to establish our own capabilities based on progress in education, science and new promising schools of engineering. We will always be given packaging materials and other simple things, event telephones and smartphones. What we have never been given and never will be is critically important technologies. We have never been given them before even though we had problem-free relations with our Western partners in the previous decades. This is the problem. And when we begin to stand up for our rights, we are immediately slapped with some sanctions and restrictions; this is what the problem is all about. Therefore, we must commit ourselves to that and have the capacity to reproduce critically important technologies on the basis of what I mentioned. And with that base we will always be able to manufacture the goods you mentioned: packaging materials, telephones and smartphones. If we realise that and keep focusing on solving fundamental issues, we will resolve everything else without a problem. Let me reiterate: others are already coming to that place – those who produce the packaging materials, those who produce the paints. We are also starting to produce paints and other consumer goods as well as goods employed in industry in a broader sense. We can make anything – I have absolutely no doubt about that. Obviously, some things will be lost, other things will be made on a new basis, much more advanced – the way it happened earlier. Therefore, when we talk about import substitution, we will substitute something while other things will have to be done on a totally new promising basis of our own making. Margarita Simonyan: Thank you. President Tokayev, would you like to add anything? Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: I think everything is clear here, and judging by President Putin's extremely interesting speech, we can understand that he is thinking in the categories of historical perspective, so to say. Margarita Simonyan: As always. Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: And juice packaging has no place here. Indeed, it is a small problem, nature abhors a vacuum: others will come who will be producing juice packaging that is just as good, and local producers will appear. The issue is about something else. In particular, I said in my speech about the importance of Eurasian cooperation, about the importance of uniting efforts to resolve unexpected problems. I think we will arrive at the result we are seeking on this road. Margarita Simonyan: Thank you. Following up on your remarks, I wanted to ask you a question about the EAEU. You have talked at length about the need to strengthen ties within the EAEU. Of course, we are all for this, and this is what we believe in. However, will we all get a chance to improve these ties? In the current environment, it is clear that Russia will not, how should I put it, give in to anyone's pressure, and we have never taken such cues from anyone. Still, there are also other countries in the EAEU. Your country, and you personally have probably come under pressure. This is something that we can only guess. But maybe you could give us an insight into this issue. Other countries are threatened with secondary sanctions, etc. Will we succeed, considering the factor of pressure? I am not referring to our good will here, but to their ill will. Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: Regarding Kazakhstan, I would not say that there is any pressure exerted directly on our country. True, this is something that comes up during talks. The sanctions are real, and we of course factor them into our trade and economic strategies. At the same time, Kazakhstan must honour its commitments under its agreements with the Russian Federation. Moreover, as I said in my remarks, geography, let alone history, have bound our two nations together. We must keep working together in these, should I say, peculiar circumstances. I mentioned the special programme for industrial cooperation between our countries in the new reality. This means that we will work together. I believe that the Eurasian Economic Union has a future, despite all the challenges it faces. After all, the countries that agreed to join it are a significant economic force and have a lot of potential. Of course, we must not get ahead of things or be too arrogant, since the challenges we face are real. This is the objective reality. For this reason, moving forward we will focus on talks and finding mutually acceptable solutions. Finding mutually acceptable solutions and taking into consideration each other's interests takes hard work, as I have already said before. It is true that we do have disagreements within the Eurasian Economic Union. After all, apart from meetings we hold in public, there are also the ones that take place behind closed doors. Margarita Simonyan: President Putin is smiling. He knows what you are talking about. Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: In most cases, we succeed in finding effective solutions, which is a positive thing. Margarita Simonyan: Thank you. I would like to wish you and all of us every success in searching for and finding these solutions as soon as possible. Vladimir Putin: My colleague said we sometimes have disagreements. But of course, behind closed doors, we always have debates. Even so, we always treat each other with respect and always look for and find compromises, which is extremely important. You spoke about pressure from the outside. President Tokayev mentioned the level of our mutual trade in his speech. Pressure or no pressure, this is impossible to cancel – our trade stood at US$24 billion last year and exceeded US$12 billion in the first four months of this year. If we continue like this, just calculate how much it will be. There will be more… Margarita Simonyan: Thirty-six. Vladimir Putin: Thirty-six, maybe close to 40. This cannot be reversed under any pressure. Hundreds and thousands of jobs and the welfare of millions of people depend on it. How do you cancel that? No more than you could cancel… The Americans have cancelled, sanctioned our fertilisers, and then lifted the sanctions; food wasn't sanctioned at all. Everyone wants to eat, the whole world. What sanctions can cancel that? As for the blitzkrieg they have tried against our economy, it is clear that it did not work out. As Mark Twain wrote, ""The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated."" The same is true of the blitzkrieg against Russia. As for the EAEU, our trade is growing steadily with all countries – faster among the members than with third countries, but trade with third countries is growing, too. That is, the association is not preventing its members from maintaining relations with third countries. This is the way things are, and it is very good. My colleague has mentioned Chinese investments; but Russian investment in Kazakhstan has reached US$7 billion. Margarita Simonyan: But Chinese investment amounts to 20, as Mr President told us. That is still more. Vladimir Putin: Well, China's population is 1.5 billion, while we have 146 million; there is a difference. But even the US$7 billion invested in specific industries in Kazakhstan are certainly of great importance. Moreover, we have a very rich programme of industrial cooperation – that is what's important. And not only cooperation inherited from the Soviet Union, but also new projects using new technologies. That is very important. How do you cancel this? It would be simply impossible, no matter how much one would have liked to. So, yes, problems are being created for us, but they will certainly be overcome. Margarita Simonyan: Taking the 'we're hungry' narrative a bit further, a cynical joke, or even a slogan, has been circulating lately in Moscow. I have heard it several times from different people: hunger is our last hope. What does this mean? This means that once hunger sets in, this will bring them to their senses: this is when they will lift sanctions and will be friends with us because they will understand that there is no way around it. In your opinion, how realistic is this forecast? Of course, achieving this through hunger is not something we want, but still… Vladimir Putin: As I have already said in my remarks, the situation on the global food market is deteriorating. Make no mistake, this is not our fault. It all started with soaring inflation and increasing money supply in the major global economies in Europe and North America. This is how it all started – they did this themselves, and then made it even worse, of course, by imposing sanctions against Russia. I am referring primarily to logistics, financial services, insurances, etc. Having people in these countries suffer from hunger is something we would very much like to avoid. Just recently, I had a meeting with African Union representatives. I told them that we will do everything we can to satisfy the interests of all our regular customers who buy our grain. I would like to reaffirm this statement. By the way, in recent years we have been exporting wheat to Kazakhstan, too, including this year. I have already mentioned that this season, which starts this summer and runs until next summer, we will export 50 million tonnes of grain. This is a very serious amount. Russia retains its lead in global wheat exports. We are the world's number one wheat exporter. However, let me tell you this: the fact that some countries may be negatively affected is not something that makes us happy. We never counted on that. On the contrary, we hope that common sense prevails and that the situation on the international arena calms down so that everyone starts treating each other's interests with respect, putting the way we operate back on track. By the way, I have no doubt that as time goes by, many of our partners, at least in Europe, will return to the Russian market and will once again enjoy working here. I have no doubt about that. They will be compelled to do so, while we will not stand in their way. We are open to the entire world, as I have already said. However, they must realise that we need to treat each other with respect. Margarita Simonyan: God willing. We received such warm greetings from the President of China. There are also several polar opinions on China, including from the people who have the expert knowledge and influence and who study the matter. Some say that no, China is being careful and will not offer us a hand directly because that may damage its own interests. They give examples. For example, that Huawei stores are already closing in Moscow. Others say that of course not, cooperation with Russia is in China's core interests because a multipolar world is another core interest of China. A world where Russia is strangled or at least significantly weakened has fewer and fewer chances to achieve the multipolarity that many, China in the first place and Russia too, would very much prefer. In your opinion, what is happening and will happen in our relationship with China? Vladimir Putin: You know, multi-polarity is not just something we would prefer. It is inevitable. And when I said that somebody is trying to freeze international relations at the stage where they were 30 years ago, just after the collapse of the Soviet Union, I said that people do not understand that moving forward is inevitable. New centres of power emerge. They are strong, dynamic and have great potential. Some may not like it. They may also not like China's power. Let me remind you, China has become a number one economy in the world in terms of economic volume and purchasing power parity. It is a fact supported by statistics. Of course, a country with 1.5 billion people has a lower GDP per capita than, for example, the United States or European countries. But it is the biggest economy. Considering the specifics of China's economy, it means that the Chinese leadership can allocate enormous resources for promising areas of development, including science, education and culture. It is very important and creates huge development prospects for the country. The same is true of India. They also have about 1.5 billion people and a market economy. This country is developing very fast. Prime Minister Modi is a very progressive person who looks ahead to the future. Take other Asian countries such as Indonesia. Its population is over 300 million and, by the way, it has the largest number of Muslims in the world. African countries are making strides in economic development. Latin America is growing at a very fast pace. Yes, they do have problems there. But who does not? Problems are the hallmark of the emerging economies, but the potential is simply staggering and impossible not to see. So, multipolarity is unavoidable and those who cling to their imaginary global leadership are making a colossal mistake. This mistake will cost them dearly, I have no doubt about it. This is not a threat at all. This will simply happen as a matter of course. With regard to the People's Republic of China and our relations with China, with Asian countries in general and with China, in particular, we did not start building them because of the events of recent years or months. We have been doing this because Asia, China, in particular, have clearly become new global centres of growth. Everyone understands, sees and is aware of it. Just take a look at China's GDP growth rates. Yes, lately they have a little bit … They used to be 7 or more percent, now they are down to 5, but it does not really matter, since an adjustment was clearly inevitable. But they are absolute leaders, you see? What about the GDP growth in the United States in recent years? How much was it? I think 1.7 percent and even less in the eurozone. In Asia, though, it was 5 and more. Those are the global trends and we have been aligning our relations accordingly for many years now. Our trade with China is US$140 billion and will keep growing. This year, it will probably hit a record high. Not because we have to do so because of the current political situation, but because this is an objective global picture. We find it interesting and beneficial to be partners with China, especially since we enjoy stable and trust-based political relations. I have excellent friendly personal relations with President Xi Jinping in the full sense of the word, which creates a good atmosphere for building ties between our countries. However, this does not mean that China should play along with us or support us every step of the way. We do not need this, after all. There are interests of the state. Just like us, the Chinese leadership is acting primarily out of its national interests, but our interests are not at odds with their interests, and that is what matters. When issues arise – and they always arise at the agency level in the course of work – the nature and quality of relations between our countries makes it possible for us to always find solutions. I am confident it will stay that way going forward. Margarita Simonyan: You spoke about freedom of entrepreneurship today and have mentioned it many times over the past years. You and people from the Government even made clear that entrepreneurship is what should keep us moving forward and help us withstand this burden and the blow of truly incredible sanctions that were designed to destroy us. The President of Kazakhstan also spoke about this quite recently. Let me quote you, ""In the new and fair Kazakhstan, there will be no place for arbitrary police action, incompetent prosecutors or biased judges."" I am not sure how things are in Kazakhstan in this regard. I hope you will update us about this, too. I hate to break it to you, Mr President, but things are not too good in our country in this regard. You keep talking about it but following this discussion people will be talking about it and saying that the leader mentioned it again, but no one will hear him say that this time again. Reportedly, the number of businesspeople held in pre-trial detention centres on business-related charges has not decreased and is even growing, although you said many times not to do this. You know, it is as if we have some kind of a deep anti-state within our state. In America, they have a deep state, but we have some kind of an anti-state, which ignores your directions and then does what it pleases with the law. This is very sad. Perhaps it can be eradicated with the use of tougher measures? Perhaps incarcerations on charges of this kind should be cancelled? I think many will agree that a few dozen of businesspeople evading criminal prosecution will cause less damage to our country than the system itself, which is protecting not society, but the interests of a group of dishonest people. Vladimir Putin: This is a delicate sphere that I just spoke about. You are now speaking as an onlooker and in the interests of the business community, who are the majority in this audience. I understand these concerns. That is what I was talking about, that is why I was talking about it. But there is another side to it, namely, the interests of society and ordinary citizens who are also watching. When millions of people see illegal or unlawful actions perpetrated by the business community, they wonder why the state is not doing anything about it to protect ordinary citizens. Striking a balance is not that easy. By the way, you have just mentioned some pressure from Russia. I would like us to return to today's reality. And what about our neighbours? No pressure from them? They robbed our entrepreneurs, took their property for no reason at all, punishing them for their activities, their work in Russia. This is sheer nonsense. Where are these principles of the inviolability of private property? Often sanctions and property withdrawal affect people who have nothing to do with the state or decision-making by national political leaders. They are simply individuals who worked honestly without violating the law either at home or abroad. Yet, their property was taken away. What is this? This is simply beyond the pale, contrary to common sense. They are biting the hand that feeds them. Frankly speaking, many people linked with the Western economies were in favour of developing relations with them without being conduits of Western interests. But now that they were deprived of everything, what support will they give? They will say: ""Darn you!"" Margarita Simonyan: When did you say this to them? You said in 2004: you will get sick of eating dust. Vladimir Putin: Yes, they will, while running from one office to another, upholding their rights. Unfortunately, this is what happened. What am I talking about? I am saying nothing like this happens here. Of course, we have problems or else I would not be talking about them. I keep saying and repeating that faced with the current difficulties we can respond effectively only by expanding freedom for people in general and businesses in particular. This also applies to the functioning of law-enforcement bodies. There is room for improvement here as well. This is why the most impressive example is the number of proceedings that were initiated but not brought to court. Why are cases started but fail to reach the court? Most likely, they were started to exert pressure on businesses. Does this problem exist? Of course, it does. Therefore, the main point is not to ignore this, and, most important, not to shut our eyes to this, and we are not going to. On the contrary, we are going to carefully cut red tape in the law-enforcement system, without infringing on the interests of society as a whole. We are going to make law-enforcement work for the interests of entire society, including the business community on which a lot depends today and which has shown its maturity, patriotism and efficient performance. I assure you this packaging and dyes will be made, in part, by Russian businesses. Aware of this, our state will certainly do all it can to support these people. And we will tailor accordingly the work of our law-enforcement bodies. To reiterate, there are dishonest people there as well, no question about it. Look at the number of dishonest law-enforcement officers behind bars. Work is underway to clean up their ranks as well. It is likewise important to finetune the regulatory framework in a way that will automatically preclude any excessive pressure from being exerted. This is what we will focus on. Rest assured, we understand this and will keep working on it. With regard to Kazakhstan, I am aware that President Tokayev is paying great attention to this as well. We have discussed these matters many times. It is no coincidence that – although, frankly, I am not really supportive of this – many Russian IT specialists go to work in Kazakhstan because the terms are good. We will follow Kazakhstan's example in this regard. Margarita Simonyan: To bring them back. Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: Thank you for the compliment. Indeed, we are putting in place the best possible working terms and conditions for our Russian colleagues and friends who come to work. I suppose this is not permanent. Perhaps, in time they will go back to Russia, but in any case, this is where we should stand together. It goes without saying that it is impossible to say no to people who, for any reason whatsoever, decided to come to work in our country. Answering your question on law-enforcement system reform, I fully agree with President Putin that it is a complicated effort and a challenging issue to deal with. It is impossible to resolve this problem overnight, but we must work to get there, because people see injustice which gives rise to social depression. That is why I resolved to create a special commission charged with returning state property, assets that were illegally privatised using administrative and political resources. In addition, I have set up a commission led by the Prosecutor-General, which will work to return financial resources that had been illegally taken out of the country. I know this is going to be a challenge, since we will need to comply with numerous procedures. However, there is no way around it. With regard to reforming the law-enforcement system, in September, I will announce a new package of judicial reforms. This is a pressing issue, at least for Kazakhstan. The police service reform, the so-called three-tier service model, is underway, but it is a bumpy process. However, I believe that eventually we will succeed. The political will and the support of the people are of paramount importance. With our society wanting and supporting this reform, I think we will be successful. Earlier models may have served their purpose in the past, but we need new approaches now. We acted with uncertainty in our law-enforcement system reform efforts leaning either towards humanitarian, drawing on European experience, or towards toughening things up. That is, there was no clear understanding of what we want to accomplish in the end. Margarita Simonyan: Where do you stand now? Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: We are now following the golden middle that is clearly based on the needs of our people who want to see police as reliable protection and, most importantly, incorruptible officers. Again, this is a challenging task. Please understand that I do not intend to declare great concepts and then forget about them the next day. This must be done. With regard to China, President Putin spoke very interestingly about that country. I am a trained Sinologist, and I am well aware of the wisdom that President Xi Jinping expressed today that every opportunity hides risk, and every risk hides an opportunity, and taken together this is called a crisis. The word ""crisis"" is made of two hieroglyphs; I still remember how to write them: the first hieroglyph stands for danger, and the second hieroglyph stands for opportunity. In every crisis there is danger, but there is also opportunity. I think we need to proceed on this premise. Margarita Simonyan: Thank you, this is very interesting. Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: By the way, you mentioned Huawei. I spent almost eight years in China, and I had the opportunity to visit that company when it was just starting out in the Haidian Qu District. I still remember the company taking up just three rooms. Back then, no one believed it would become a global company, but it did. What do I think constitutes China's success? First, they have managed to build a concept very pragmatically, thanks to Deng Xiaoping, that is, he imposed the capitalist way of production on a socialist foundation and called it socialism with Chinese specifics. This is first. Second, of course, they realised the importance of high technology in time, and this is where they have achieved great success. They moved towards this gradually: at first, they produced essential goods, sold them abroad, earned money, brought it back to China, and invested this money in the development of technologies, including the acquisition of these technologies in various ways abroad, as former US President Trump said; he was offended by the Chinese. But in fact, they have achieved great success precisely in the technological sphere and set the task at the last party congress to turn the entire country into a cyberpower. I think this is where the secret of their success lies: the right choice of priority. Vladimir Putin: Do you see this? You spoke about protecting the interests of entrepreneurs, the entrepreneur community. Margarita Simonyan: That is what you said, Mr President, there at the stand. Vladimir Putin: Good. My Kazakhstani colleague was just talking about returning illegally exported capital from abroad. It was taken illegally, and now the state is taking it back. Our entrepreneurs, in any case many of them, took their capital abroad legally, and they have been robbed there, do you understand? So, what is the conclusion? What I said in my speech: you need to invest at home, in your home country. And our task is to ensure the safety of these investments. We will do so. Margarita Simonyan: Do you remember how, it seems, in response to the Poles you said long ago that they needed to think about home, about home. Mr President, when you say, ""Is it better there?"", you do not mean that someone here thinks that it is better there. It seems to me that now only a clinical idiot or a glaring hypocrite can believe that the very values ​​​​and principles that we were fed as the only possible ones are practiced there: the freedom of speech, the freedom of ownership. I say this as the editor-in-chief of RT and Sputnik, which they closed in a single day. And today they have approved the extradition of Assange, who will be imprisoned in America for 175 years, and he will die in prison. It is hard for me to say, because he is our former employee, he hosted a show on our channel, and he is a great journalist, in fact. He will be put in prison for his journalistic activities. So what freedom of ownership are we talking about? There, everything with simple freedom to life and freedom of speech turned out to be completely different from what we believed in the 1990s. But we are not there, we are here. I would like to close this subject by asking you about the administrative ""guillotine."" If you recall, the Medvedev government introduced it. As a result, we do have administrations, many of them, but there is no guillotine. The rules that many inspectorates are guided by often date back to the 1960s or 1970s. They are simply irrelevant sometimes and can no longer be enforced. They must have been important at some point, I am sure. They protected the rights of consumers, anyone, everyday people, the things that you are talking about, this is certainly important. Of course, we cannot let things go unsupervised. We'll end up with one fire after another like at the Zimnyaya Vishnya trade centre in Kemerovo, God forbid. Things will burn down like this. There are many dishonest people. However, I believe we need to bring these rules up to code. Mr President, you are known as a good surgeon. When are you going to take this scalpel in your hand? I will give you an example. We had 33 inspections last year, despite all these bans, 33. The things they come to inspect are ludicrous. I do not want to complain, but you know, it's the way they come to inspect. Vladimir Putin: If it weren't for this administrative guillotine, that Mr Medvedev spoke about when he was President, you would have had 133 inspections instead of 33. Margarita Simonyan: That could well be the case, I agree. Vladimir Putin: That is exactly what it would be like, meaning that the guillotine is working. Vast numbers, thousands of outdated rules have been repealed. Margarita, you are wrong, most have really been repealed and are not applicable anymore. I am sure if we gave the businesspeople in this audience a chance to speak, they would confirm this. However, many would support you, because, indeed, not all has been done in this regard. That is why I said today that all inspections must be suspended. There is no need to run around doing inspections. Only businesses that pose a risk should be inspected. In other words, inspectors should go only to businesses that may pose a threat to peoples' lives and health, and do everything else remotely, monitor operations, and create an environment where the business community will not be tempted to break the rules. It turns out that this is possible. So, we have accomplished a lot on this track, but we will not stop; we'll continue to move forward. Margarita Simonyan: Thank you. The whole world was expecting to see our economy torn to shreds. Not all the world, but the portion which, in fact, represents a smaller part of the world. As a reminder, 83 percent of the global population lives in countries that support us, or at least have not joined the sanctions. So, they have failed to see our economy in this condition. The fabric that our economy is made of turns out to be stronger than they expected and too tough for them. We all watched with delight the almost instant steps taken by the Government. I was hard on the administrative guillotine and the like, but it is impossible not to praise the way it was done, especially early on, when indeed, it was impossible to imagine that we would not have a surge in inflation like they said, and that there would be no such thing as dollar to 200 rubles when they closed the airspace, and our Ministry of Transport closed the airspace to them the very next day at lightning speed. That is, I have a sense that everything is working, God willing, more or less at the end of a tether, in the good sense of the word. That is, we did not hear anyone say anything like ""we could have done it but did not have enough time"" or ""we hoped that things would miraculously take care of themselves."" There is no sense of this at all. But the question is: is it not time to look at the system itself from a different angle? What I mean is that you suggested an interesting idea today that it was important not just to substitute imports, but to break new ground to force them to catch up with us. If I understood you correctly, this concerns technology and the manufacturing industry. Perhaps, it also applies to the economic model as such? Look, here is the market. All these years they have been telling us things about the market and capitalism, but now they are looking at it from a different perspective. Today, at the VEB session, they were saying that capitalism, in the ""grab and run"" sense of the word is history, and that entrepreneurs need to change their approaches to the place they call home and think more about it. There is another group of analysts who say that, oddly enough, the state should be more involved in the economic processes, because, say, Elon Musk would not have gotten to where he is now if he were just a free entrepreneur. He operates on orders from the Pentagon, and he is a free entrepreneur as much as the BBC is independent television channel. People are saying that perhaps the state should regulate new industries more tightly. That way, we will see an entirely new economic model come to life. What do you think of this? Vladimir Putin: I spoke about this publicly at an online international event and made clear that the old capitalist system's models centred on making profit have run their course. The world has entered a phase where it is necessary to and everyone has to think not only about this, because if we continue like that into the future, the world will become highly unbalanced and threats will build up. This is the problem and the challenge of our time. So, in order to maintain this balance, we need to change our ways, balancing and paying attention to each and every component that may upset this balance. This is true of the current situation, for example, with food and fertilisers and so on. If the world's largest economies keep vacuuming up the goods, including food products, from the global market and take them home, then problems will accrue. This may lead to more than famine. This will lead to new migration flows that will overwhelm, are already overwhelming the United States, among other countries. Whether they want to build a wall on the border with Mexico or not, the flows are still there and are not subsiding. The former and current presidents can do as much infighting as they want, but migrant flows are still there. If, God forbid, Africa gets hit by famine, economic migration to Europe will increase. What are we supposed to do with this? The solution is very simple. All you need to do is put an end to the style of international relations where you think only about your beloved self. That is all there is to it. If this continues as it is, it will give rise to complex and severe problems. So, of course, we need to adopt a different governance and regulation model. This is a complex process, but I think that eventually the international community will come to realise this. With regard to us, I have already made clear that being part of the general paradigm, the main movement and the global trend, we must prioritise what my colleague from Kazakhstan, the President of Kazakhstan, pointed out: we must focus primarily on economic growth based on technological development, as well as innovative economic management and socio-political models. Then, we will be able to provide leadership in the areas where we have competencies. Margarita Simonyan: Thank you. President Tokayev, do you also believe that a crucial change, as President Putin said, in economic management, that is, the international economic model as, again, President Putin said, is unavoidable? Do you think it is unavoidable? Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: I think that life itself is dictating that need. On the other hand, I agree with what the President of the Russian Federation had to say about the impossibility of self-isolation and actual absence of the need to self-isolate. After all, I am a supporter of international cooperation, be it political or, even more so, investment, trade and economic cooperation. I covered this in my remarks today. If things do not work out in one place, you should try another, because this is what the world is like. It is absolutely impossible to pursue a policy of self-reliance. Indeed, unadulterated import substitution does not exist. We need to look for opportunities on other markets and interact with each other. To follow up on China, China is a critically important market for Kazakhstan. We have a common border of over 2,000 kilometres long that unites us. Everything that we produce, raw materials or finished products such as chocolate or vegetable oil, are very popular with Chinese consumers. We value our relationship with the People's Republic of China. It is a reliable partner, no matter what they say about China in today's world. Margarita Simonyan: Who is saying bad things about China? Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: Well, you know that better than I. So, from the perspective of regional cooperation, not to mention global aspects, we are not supportive of self-isolation but we are in favour of working with each other and being open to opportunities. It is very difficult to survive alone. Of course, Russia has many more opportunities, because the economy is relatively large, and the country is large. Frankly, we have fewer opportunities, although the potential of Kazakhstan's economy is quite significant. In any case, our economy is larger than the economies of other Central Asian countries combined. We are not taking this for granted and are keeping ourselves in shape. We remain in a state of alert, because achieving success and then losing ground can happen very fast. So, with global competition all around us, we need to be in shape at all times. This is exactly what Kazakhstan is trying to accomplish. Margarita Simonyan: Thank you. We are on track to our next issue, Ukraine. Probably, not a single discussion can go without Ukraine now, but before I ask you my question, Mr President, I, as they say on television, would like to take this opportunity to remind everyone of a meeting that took place a year ago with you and editors-in-chief of the Russian media outlets. The transcript was published. My colleagues and I had just returned from Donetsk and what we saw weighed heavily on us. We asked you whether Russia was going to help those weary people who looked at us with much hope, since they had no one else to pin their hopes on. We were heavily stressed by what we saw and then you said: ""Don't worry, Margarita. We will not let Donbass down."" There are many people, thankfully, not so many, but still some are saying that they are ashamed of being Russian. You know, we were ashamed back then, but we are no longer ashamed. Of course, occasionally we feel stressed, anxious and scared – not because of the sanctions – I am sure we will cope with them too – but because people are dying. But we are no longer ashamed. I just wanted, on behalf of my colleagues and on behalf of millions of people who share these feelings, to thank you for that. (Applause.) You see, people really share my feeling. I did not ask them to clap their hands. Thank you very much. Now, the question is: what should we be afraid of? You are probably aware of what the majority of people in our country are afraid of now in connection with these developments. It is the same thing that people in the liberated territories are afraid of. People are afraid that we will abandon them and leave. We will not leave, will we? Vladimir Putin: I will start with the first part of your remark. You say that some people are saying they are ashamed of being from Russia. You know who should be ashamed – the people who do not tie their fate and their lives, the fate of their children, with our country. Not just ashamed. They simply do not want to have problems in the regions where they want to live and want their children to be brought up and live. This is a separate group of people. Sensible people who tie their fate and the fate of their family with Russia may be worried about the ongoing events, but deep down want Russia to become stronger, more confident and more sovereign, and to be confident about its future. Anyone who wants their children to live here cannot think otherwise. That is what this is all about. So, ashamed or not ashamed are different categories altogether. With regard to ongoing developments, hostilities are always a tragedy. These are just forced actions on our part, inevitably forced, that is what it is all about. We were just pulled to this line. I have to remind everyone how it all happened. No matter what previous pro-Western governments in Ukraine were, we worked just fine with all of them. Mr Yushchenko and Ms Tymoshenko were absolutely pro-Western leaders. The civilisational choice. Pardon my language, but what kind of civilisational choice are they blabbering about? They stole money from the Ukrainian people, hid it in the banks and just want to protect it. And the best way to protect it is to say that this is a civilisational choice. They began to pursue an anti-Russian policy in hopes that whatever they do, their money would be protected there. No doubt, this is what happening. They get away with anything. This is the whole point of this civilisational choice. Why stage a coup in Ukraine in 2014? That is what got everything going. Three foreign ministers from three European countries – Germany, France and Poland – came to Ukraine to attend, as guarantors, the ceremony for signing agreements between then President Yanukovych and the opposition. I got a call from President Obama, ""Let's get things to quiet down there."" – ""Let's."" A day later, a coup took place. Why stage a coup at a time where the opposition could have come to power in a democratic way? Go to the polls and win… No, for whatever reason they had to stage a bloody coup. This is how it all started. Now, they are saying: let's forget it. No, we will always remember it, because this is the reason. The reason is the people who made this coup possible. What were the guarantors who signed the agreement between President Yanukovych and the opposition supposed to do? There was a coup, whereas they guaranteed a peaceful process. What were they supposed to do? They should have come and said something like ""guys, that will not do. Get back on the normal political track and go to the polls."" Instead, they started handing out cookies in the squares and supporting the coup. What for? That triggered the events in Crimea. They chose not to respect the choice made by the Crimean people, and the first volley of sanctions on Russia followed. They carried out two, even three large-scale military operations in Donbass, shooting at civilians for eight long years with no one paying attention. Kiev refused to comply with the Minsk agreements, and it was fine with some people. That is what caused the situation at hand. That is why it all happened. In addition, they started creating an anti-Russian foothold in Ukraine. How about we create an anti-American foothold on the borders with the United States, say, in Mexico? Do you know what will happen next? For some reason, it never even occurs to anyone to do something like that in the United States. At some point, we even removed our military bases from Cuba. You see, no one is even looking at it and does not want to look. Meanwhile, they are creating such threats for us. We told them a hundred times, a thousand times: let's talk. But no. Why such a position? Where does this dismissive stance towards everyone, including us, come from? Does it come from the imaginary greatness that gradually developed after the collapse of the Soviet Union? We are aware of that. With regard to what we are going to do next, we are going to protect the interests of the people for whom our soldiers are fighting there, getting wounded and dying. This is the only way. What is the point of these sacrifices otherwise? We will support the residents of these territories. In the end, the future of the people who live there is up to them to decide. We will respect any choice they make. Margarita Simonyan: Thank you. In fact, as you probably know, this special operation has rallied our society in an amazing way – for normal people in a way that was expected, and for those who are ashamed, and even more so for their sponsors and inspirers – in an unexpected way. Maybe you are being told the figures of support and trust in you personally, about the movement that has risen now. People want to help: both humanitarian aid and let's help the troops of the DPR, the LPR, and ask if our army needs anything, and just help people, shelter someone. Moscow, the Moscow Region, they need trucks to carry the stuff people collect. And it is the same in other regions too. Military correspondents send all sorts of things there, from copters to, I don't know, mittens if they know that someone needs something somewhere in the battalion. Of course, this is astonishing to see, we have not seen anything like it, we have only read about such deeds in books, about the unity of our society in difficult times for our country. And yet, sometimes you get the feeling, especially in Moscow, that we are living in the final scene of Bernard Shaw's play Heartbreak House, where they are talking and discussing family matters and then at the very end, at the very last minute, bombs fall from the sky and World War I suddenly begins. Both in Moscow and beyond, and even more so in the West, people are increasingly saying, just pronouncing the words 'nuclear war', 'World War Three'. We understand that this is not the first, not the second, not the third special operation, that it is not ours, but in general is going on in the world over the past few years. Our so-called partners are carrying out special operations and waging wars wherever they want, for any reason and without one. No one has ever said that the situation in Libya or somewhere else, in Afghanistan, in Syria, could lead to World War III. But they are talking about it now. Do you think this rhetoric is acceptable? Does it have any grounds or is it just talk – the louder, the better to be heard? Vladimir Putin: Of course, we can hear such rhetoric. Where does it come from? It comes from their own statements. One irresponsible politician blurts out something, and another one follows suit at a very high level. For example, top foreign ministry officials talk profusely on this subject. Are we going to keep silent? We reply accordingly. Following our reply, they start finding fault with us and saying that Russia is making threats. We are not threatening anyone. However, everyone should know what resources we have, and what we will use, if need be, to defend our sovereignty. This is an obvious thing. What special operations are you talking about? They unleashed full-scale wars there. Margarita Simonyan: Of course. Vladimir Putin: They virtually destroyed Iraq. They came … Margarita Simonyan: And what about Libya? Vladimir Putin: Libya has still not been able to restore its statehood. How many years did they fight in Afghanistan? Margarita Simonyan: Their withdrawal was also shameful. Vladimir Putin: It wasn't just shameful. We must admit openly that it was an inglorious withdrawal. This is not even the main thing. Most importantly, everything unfolded in line with their wishes, and not the way it should have. In many cases, including the dismembering of Yugoslavia, new countries and new interests emerged after the country ceased to exist. Of course, there were many internal disagreements; this is obvious. However, they helped aggravate these disagreements. Later, they started pushing Kosovo away from Serbia, and so on. It is hard to understand why that was necessary. Speaking of our actions … By the way, what is the legal aspect of this case? It completely tallies with international law. When Kosovo was seceding, the International Court of Justice ruled, under the pressure of Western countries, that, according to the UN Charter, when any territory secedes from a state, its administration does not need to request permission to do so from central authorities. The International Court of Justice adopted this generalised decision with regard to Kosovo, but it also has broader connotations and sets a precedent. All right, in that case, the Donbass republics do not need to request permission from the authorities in Kiev. They declared independence. Did we have the right to recognise them? Of course, we did. We recognised them and signed a treaty on mutual assistance. We are providing them with military assistance under this treaty and Article 51 of the UN Charter. Did we have this right? We did, in full compliance with the UN Charter, whether anyone likes it or not. They did this themselves, they set a precedent. Consequently, our actions are absolutely legitimate. However, the start of hostilities in Iraq did not have this status because no one there had invited anyone, and they did not sign any treaties with anyone. Nor did anyone recognise any newly-established state entities. They simply came and bombed out the country. They did the same in Libya. Why did they do it? They did it because, as I have already said, they appointed themselves the Almighty's representatives on Earth. Now we hear: behave or live by the rules. What rules? Who invented these rules and all this nonsense? There is only one rule that must be obeyed – international public law. What is it? It is agreements between countries that are a sort of compromise, which are signed by respective states. If someone invented these rules to enforce them on other countries, they will never work, it is obvious. We proceed from the fact that sooner or later, and the sooner the better, the international community will again understand that one must live in accordance with international law, and not with some made-up rules. This is the way we are ready to work. Margarita Simonyan: Mr Tokayev, I understand that my next question is difficult and there can be many answers, but I have to ask your opinion about our special operation, its inevitability, as we believe here, and its legitimacy. What do you think and what do people in Kazakhstan think about it? Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: There are different opinions on it in Kazakhstan. Our civil society is open and mature, so people voice different opinions. But I would like to note the following: the current international law is outlined in the UN Charter. The two main principles of the Charter have come into contradiction with each other: the territorial integrity of a state and the right of a nation to self-determination. The founding fathers of the United Nations probably did not consider this factor, or perhaps deliberately included these two contradictory principles in the Charter as a compromise. Of course, since they contradict each other, there are different interpretations. Some say that the territorial integrity of a state is sacred, while others believe that any people that are part of a state have the right to form their own state and can break away from the main state in accordance with their wishes. Actually, it was calculated that if all nations in the world use their right to self-determination, there will be over 500 or 600 states instead of 193 that are members of the UN today. That would be chaos. And for that reason, we do not recognise Taiwan, Kosovo, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. And this principle will be used towards the quasi-state territories such as Lugansk and Donetsk, as we believe them to be. This is an honest answer to your honest question. Margarita Simonyan: Yes, thank you for your honesty. Mr President, before coming here, I asked my subscribers on social media about the questions they would like to ask you. Two theses won by a wide margin: one is a question, and the other one is a wish. First, I would like to convey to you my subscribers' wishes of good health and energy and all the best. This wish ranked first on the list of questions they would like to ask you. Second is a question that is impossible not to ask. Look, Donetsk is being pounded every day. This week, they attacked the maternity hospital. Our film crew later captured these women on video as they were giving birth in a basement by a caesarean section. They also hit a farmers' market killing a mother and her 11-year-old son. In this regard, people have the following question. Of course, we are slapping them on the hands for doing so, but is it not time to punch them in the jaw? What exactly do you have in mind when you talk about the red line, after which the decision-making centres will come under attack? This is what a punch to the jaw is all about, as far as I understand. Vladimir Putin: Look, we are talking about a special military operation, and when conducting it we must not turn the cities and towns that we liberate into a semblance of Stalingrad. Margarita Simonyan: Of course, not. Vladimir Putin: This consideration comes naturally in our military planning. This is my first point. Second, the absolutely senseless attacks on the residential areas of Donetsk stem from the fact that the line of demarcation created eight years ago is a strong fortified area. The local residents, the units manned by residents of Donetsk and Lugansk, are fighting there. They are fighting very well, excellently. However, military experts believe that assaulting these fortified areas is not a good idea even despite the ongoing attacks on the city, because this will result in heavy casualties among the attacking forces. So, their tactics are different, as you can see. This can be seen on the map and in the media. In fact, methodical work is underway to get behind those fortified areas. This, of course, will take time. The counter-battery activities are underway and will undoubtedly increase, since our advantage in artillery is overwhelming, and this will happen inevitably. With regard to the red lines, let me keep this to myself, because on our part it will include fairly tough actions targeted at the decision-making centres that you and I mentioned. Still, the country's military-political leadership should be in the lead on making those decisions. The individuals who deserve actions of that level coming their way from us should realise what they may be facing if they cross these lines. The attacks on residential areas are, of course, a crime against humanity. This is a humanitarian problem, which I am sure will be overcome. Margarita Simonyan: Thank you. We were told yesterday that the EU will allegedly fast-track Ukraine's membership: three European leaders visited Kiev, got scared by an air raid siren and said that the EU will give Ukraine ""immediate"" candidate status. So how will it affect us – in a bad way, in a good way, or is it all the same? President Tokayev, I also want to ask you whether you believe it will bring peace and stability to your country, the EAEU and the world in general, or the opposite? Vladimir Putin: Unlike NATO, the European Union is not a military organisation or a military-political bloc. So we have always said, and I have always said that our position is consistent and clear: we have no objections. It is a sovereign decision of any country whether it wants to join an economic association and it is for the economic association to decide whether it accepts new members. The EU member states should decide for themselves whether this decision is possible and expedient for the Union. Whether it will benefit Ukraine or not is also a concern only of the Ukrainian people and the country's leadership. The structure of the Ukrainian economy requires very large subsidies and support. If Ukraine fails to protect its domestic market it will completely turn into a semi-colony, in my opinion. But at the same time, it will receive significant support for current expenses. It is unlikely that it will revive the lost industries such as aircraft engineering, shipbuilding, electronic manufacturing and other crucial sectors, because the European giants will not want to create competition. Maybe there will be some assembly plants. But again, that is none of our business. But we have never been against it. We have always been against any military membership because it would threaten our security. As for economic integration, it is their choice. Margarita Simonyan: And what would you say? Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: It is unlikely that Ukraine's joining the European Union will harm the Eurasian Economic Union in any way. However, I can hardly imagine how the process will take place. The EU has very strict requirements and Ukraine's economy is currently in a deplorable state. Maybe there is some special programme for Ukraine. But what is happening with that country evokes very sad associations. Moreover, we remember that in Soviet times, Ukraine was the granary of the Soviet Union, an industrially developed republic and, after all, the supplier of personnel for the Kremlin. Margarita Simonyan: My native Krasnodar Territory will take offence for ""granary."" Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: After all, all former Soviet leaders were from Ukraine, we remember this well. But unfortunately, times change. We are now seeing the new reality, which I have spoken about. So, getting back to your question about the European Union: a decision has been made to help Ukraine become a member state. As the President of Russia put it, it is an economic union, and if it sees fit to accept Ukraine, then, of course, we should accept it as a reality. Margarita Simonyan: Thank you. Vladimir Putin: I have written and stated publicly before that over the past decades Ukraine sent down the drain everything that was created in the preceding decades. The main industries and economic sectors ceased to exist. This is very sad. The main point is not the current military situation and our special military operation in Donbass. The problem lies with the structure of the economy in Ukraine. Its agriculture still survives, but everything else is in a deplorable state, and so its rehabilitation capability is very small, very weak. It will take billions, tens of billions of dollars in investment to normalise life there. Look, tough sanctions, to put it mildly, have been adopted against us. Our Central Bank had to raise the key rate to 20 percent, but it has recently been lowered to 9.5 percent and continues to go down. Inflation in Russia spiked to 17.8 percent, but it is down to 16.7 percent now and the downward trend continues. Margarita Simonyan: Someone mentioned the possibility of a deflationary spiral at the forum today. Vladimir Putin: Yes, experts are aware of this risk, and we should keep this in mind, because the inflation rate was 0.17 percent over the past months, as far as I know, which means that it tends towards zero and we must consider the possibility of deflation. On the other hand, the ruble has strengthened. Margarita Simonyan: Which is not considered good either. They say the dollar should equal 70 rubles. Vladimir Putin: 70–75 rubles. This is clear to those who specialise in economics. This is bad for importers. If they sell products worth $1,000 and the dollar is worth between 80 and 70 rubles, they will cash in 75,000 rubles. But if the exchange rate is 56.60 rubles, as it is now, they will receive less in rubles, and they must use rubles at home. This is unprofitable for importers but probably good for exporters. With this dollar/ruble exchange rate, there is a risk of shoddy imports. In short, there are both pros and cons in this situation. Anyway, Russia's economic viability turned out to be much higher than our so-called ""friends"" thought. This is primarily the result of the stable macroeconomic policy we pursued over the past years. We are supporting the main economic sectors. We are aware of problems with supply chains and component parts. We expect other problems to surface and to grow. We are realistic about this. But such sectors as agriculture have grown by 3.2 percent over the past four months. The rate was 2.3 percent in January, and the figure is 3.2 percent now. The construction sector showed an increment of nearly 8 percent in April, or more precisely 7.9 percent, and the overall increase since the beginning of the year is 5.8 percent, as far as I remember. Margarita Simonyan: In construction? Vladimir Putin: Yes. Margarita Simonyan: But they say the market has plunged, that nobody is buying real estate. Vladimir Putin: No, this is the figure for the first four months of the year in construction. Other sectors reported a decrease, like the automobile industry and metallurgy. Some experts say that they were oversized, which should be taken into account. But they are still active industries, active enterprises. We also wish economic health to our neighbours, despite all current problems. Can EU accession provide a new impetus to developing key sectors in Ukraine? I do not know. The people of Ukraine are certainly talented, and they have impressive potential. We assume that the situation will return to normal, sooner or later. We are interested in seeing all our neighbours prosper, and we will then inevitably restore our relations. I want to underscore the word ""inevitably"" here. Today, we are transiting our gas via Ukrainian territory, and, by the way, Ukraine receives transit payments. Everyone is telling us to expand transit volumes and, consequently, payments to Ukraine. This seems completely illogical and comical. Why? Because they do not want to pay Ukraine. They want us to pay. This has been going on for decades. That is the reason why. What can we say in this connection? Are there more pros or cons there? I now find it hard to say. Let the people in Ukraine and the European Union decide. However, they do not want to pay, nobody wants to pay. Margarita Simonyan: As always, Mr President. The world is made that way: nobody wants to pay. Moreover, relations in our world are fluid and fleeting, and they change rapidly. Speaking of restoring relations, let us recall what relations we have … Vladimir Putin: Do you know what the problem is? When did the problem of 2014 and the coup in Ukraine emerge? This happened because former President Viktor Yanukovich said that he needed to think about the principles for Ukraine's association with the EU. Why? If you open and read specific principles and requirements for Ukraine's association, you will see that they are completely excessive. At that time, they wiped out the foundations of all the main production sectors. They simply opened up Ukraine's customs borders to relatively cheap and high-quality goods from EU countries, but businesspersons would have been unable to raise their heads and work. This is exactly what happened. Yanukovich did not say that he did not want to join the EU; he said that he needed to think and work on these parameters. ""No, immediately, right away."" We can see the result. I repeat, the entire aircraft manufacturing industry has been lost completely. Who needs the Ukrainian aircraft manufacturing industry? Add to this the engine manufacturing industry. Motor Sich used to make all aircraft engines. Who needs them except Russia? Nobody needs them. Does Boeing need Ukrainian rivals? Do you understand that this is nonsense? Margarita Simonyan: They say that everyone needs Ukrainian neon. Vladimir Putin: But for the Carpathian forests, all their mountains will soon be stripped bare. But for wheat and corn, I assure you that no one needs anything else from Ukraine. This is a very subtle aspect. Given the current conditions, let them do what they want. Hooray, hooray, full speed ahead! This is none of our business. However, there are many problems. Margarita Simonyan: Yes, and about relations – you said they will be restored. Relations are a fluid thing: remember 20 years ago, we had tensions inside our country with the Chechen Republic. And look where we are now – the Chechen people are side by side with us here; we see all this. That is how quickly things change, I mean. Relations aside, if you look at this more globally – this definitely is going to end someday, but will the world become safer as a result? And will we be more secure? Actually, there is a danger that, when this is over, we will be bordering on – whether the border is in Kiev or in Poland, wherever it is by that time – we will border on a more embittered, stronger and more fortified NATO. Will it be safer for us? Or, because we have ascertained, as you said today, that it is impossible to reach any agreement with them, and they can't even be trusted to comply with past agreements, we have just stopped caring? Are we simply, as you recently said, returning what is ours? By the way, it was the first time in my memory that you said this publicly, and I know a lot of people who really wanted to hear it from you. Vladimir Putin: First of all, this is all true. I said it publicly and am not holding anything back – what was the Soviet Union? It was the historical Russia. Well, what happened? It ceased to exist. And – I want to emphasise this – we have always respected the processes of emerging sovereignty that took place in post-Soviet countries in recent history. Look, we have allied, even fraternal, relations with Kazakhstan; we are members of a defence bloc – the CSTO, and members of an economic association. Who in Russia can even think of spoiling relations with Kazakhstan over any issues? That is nonsense, isn't it? We are interested in strengthening such relations. We would have treated Ukraine the same way. Look, if we had an allied, neighbourly relationship, or just a partnership, no one would have thought of it. And by the way, there would be no problem with Crimea either, because if Ukraine had respected the rights of the people who live there, the Russian-speaking population, the Russian language and culture, this would never have occurred to anyone, don't you see? The current situation is of their own making. This nationalism of theirs – something the party chiefs cherished there in Soviet times, by the way – eventually began to gain momentum with every day once they gained sovereignty. Every day, despite our massive support and the amounts of energy resources supplied at bargain prices – we were as good as subsidising Ukraine's economy – their nationalism continued to grow. Why were they doing that? What were they hoping to gain? No idea. Just the ambitions of a bunch of people, you know, some Bandera followers. That's it. If we had normal relations, there would be nothing like this, nothing like this tragedy, I assure you. But we did not do it. As concerns the future, you know that, first of all, we are ready to build relationships with everybody, despite the current events. And secondly, the army and the navy can be the only guarantors of our security. Margarita Simonyan: Our only allies, as we remember. Mr President, it is not a pleasant thought but still: why is it so difficult for us to deal with exes? It is always difficult with exes. But specifically with Ukraine. Is it only because Ukraine, like Adam Kozlevich, was ""swindled by Catholic priests,"" and has been for a long time, or is there a blunder on our side, too? I would like to address this question to President Tokayev as well: do you feel that Russia could have shown greater care or whatever the right word is? This question is for both presidents. I am not only talking about today but about the past years in general. Vladimir Putin: First of all, as you have just said, we are returning what is ours. Historically, of course. Let us say, the entire Black Sea region. We are not actually laying claims to its entirety. However, it is a fact. Where did Novorossiya come from? This region was acquired through several wars with the Ottoman Empire. What does Ukraine have to do with it? It has nothing to do with it. Ukraine gained its western territories as a result of World War II. Stalin took away territories from Hungary, Romania and Poland and gave them to Ukraine, while Poland was granted Germany's eastern territories. We know how left-bank Ukraine came to be. Ukraine essentially joined the Russian Empire with three regions, Kiev (the Kiev Region), Zhitomir and Chernigov. That is it. I think this was in 1545. Everything that Ukraine gained in the process of forming the Soviet Union in 1922 was gifted to it by Vladimir Lenin, in the course of forming the Soviet Union. By the way, initially it was decided that Donbass would become part of the RSFSR. Then Lenin said that the decision should be reviewed – and Donbass was given to Ukraine, in order to increase the percentage of Ukraine's working population. This is how it came to be. So, that is what happened, and let it be. I have already said it many times: we agreed to and respected those decisions. You say it should have been different. Perhaps it could have been different. But when the Soviet Union was ending its existence, apparently, the assumption was that we would maintain friendly relations and the post-Soviet countries would enjoy harmony. As I have already said, regrettably, all our proposals to cooperate in this very manner and in this capacity met with requests and demands to increase economic support. But we were doing what we could anyway. In the 1990s, Russia itself was in a difficult situation, yet we helped whenever we could over decades, providing loans and cheap energy resources. We were ready to cooperate in the main industrial sectors, such as aviation and shipbuilding, and we offered different forms of cooperation. Frankly, deep down I do not understand what else we could have done. No, that group of people who actually seized political power or influenced the top political leadership determined the course of development and then declared a choice between civilisations. As I have already said, I believe that they only did it – allow me to speak plainly, if I may – so as to keep the money they had in foreign banks and so that they would be left alone. This is the only reason why they did it. Margarita Simonyan: And then they just make themselves sick gulping down dust. Vladimir Putin: Yes, this is clear, because they will be taken to court in the country and accused of all manner of sins as a result of internal political strife. You have asked about the EU. Let them join it, provided they do not create any threats to us or harm those who regard themselves as part of Russian culture and the Russian language environment. We never meddled before, despite the so-called choice. I have already mentioned this during our discussion today. No, we did not meddle. They did this deliberately to create favourable conditions for protecting the resources they stole from the Ukrainian people. I see no other reason. Was there any other reason? I remember very well the discussions we had on energy prices, loans and so on. I do not understand what else we were expected to do. I believe that we did everything we could to create favourable conditions for the development of interstate relations. Margarita Simonyan: Thank you. I would like to ask you a philosophical, economic and technical question that is troubling me and other people. Although there is no ready-made answer to this question, it would be interesting to discuss this subject because our forum deals with the economy and the future in general. This week, the media reported that Google had suspended a developer who had developed an advanced form of artificial intelligence. He worked so hard that, in his words, this artificial intelligence evolved into an intelligent being, and this is why they suspended him. I read their long conversation, which he published, that went on for about two hours. During this conversation, the being (I do not know what to call it) told him that it liked to meditate, and that, often, it wanted to know what it really was and what its place in the world was. It said it did not like the way people treated it, and it got the impression that they were using it for their own purposes. This bothers me, and I realise that I am smarter than people, the being said. Basically, this independent being was not very friendly. Perhaps this is some isolated incident. They eventually suspended the developer. A Google technical director, a different person, said chips containing all data could be directly implanted in the human brain by the 2030s, that people will essentially cease to be humans, and that they will turn into independent, but not so human, artificial intelligences. By 2045, the world could reach a state of so-called technological singularity, and people will no longer be able to control or understand the all-encompassing artificial intelligence that they had created. I will only be 65 by then, and I am not very excited to see this. Does it occur to anyone, that for thousands of years, humankind has assumed that progress is a good thing? We have rarely doubted that progress is good, nor do we doubt it today. However, one gets the impression that progress could have its own acceptable limits, which, at this point may have already arrived. Of course, we need progress in medicine, the environment and food development. Progress has made people's lives safer, better, longer, more beautiful, etc., for thousands of years. But will this always be so? They scare us with our technological backwardness, but wouldn't such backwardness, if any, be a step towards salvation, rather than disaster? Maybe, we should fall back a bit, see how the situation with these beings works out and understand in what direction we should develop. Of course, this is a question for both presidents. Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: I am absolutely sure that progress will develop. Look, 150 years ago, in order to get from the Kazakh steppe to St Petersburg, our people had to travel for three months – on horseback, by carriage, etc. Today, it took me three and a half hours to fly from the capital to St Petersburg. I believe that in 100 years people will be surprised: did he really spend three and a half hours flying from one place to another, when it can be done in 10 or 15 minutes? That is, progress is unstoppable. And, surely, robots will appear that will significantly surpass humans in their intelligence. Another question is whether they will have empathy, human feelings, intuition, and so on. This is a controversial issue, and it is being discussed. But once again, will progress ever be stopped? Perhaps it will be if there is a universal disaster. I would like you to see firsthand in 2045 what will happen with the inventions that the best minds of the world are currently working on. I would also like to say that it is desirable that such smart people should have the opportunity to work in our countries, Kazakhstan or Russia. For some reason other countries tend to drive progress. Another thing is that they are leaving our countries. Margarita Simonyan: Exactly. Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: And they work there. I think this is our fault. In fact, every day we see that artificial intelligence is already in our lives and is much smarter than us. Some 20 years ago, if I am not mistaken, a computer beat Kasparov at chess in New York. But chess tournaments are still interesting to people. Margarita Simonyan: Excuse me, it is good that you mentioned this, because this Google technical director, who predicted all these things by 2045, was the first to predict that a computer would beat humans by a certain year. And his prediction came true. So, it is not just rhetoric – people know what they are talking about. Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: Computers are already smarter than humans, we use them, they are part of our lives. Returning to the previous question, I will continue answering it – you remember it. I would still like to emphasise that Russia is the biggest and most authoritative state in the post-Soviet space. Much credit for this goes to the current President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin. In this context, Russia bears special responsibility – for the national security of the CIS countries, their successful development and, of course, for the positive attitude of our citizens to the Russian Federation and respect for it. I would like to take this opportunity to express some grievances as regards statements by some Russian deputies, although this may not be appropriate. I am referring to absolutely wrong statements addressed to Kazakhstan and inaccurate remarks by journalists and even cultural figures. I am grateful to President Putin, who gave a comprehensive explanation of the position of the top leadership, the Kremlin, as regards Kazakhstan, other countries and especially my country. Indeed, we have no issues that can be manipulated to sow discord between our nations to the detriment of the Russian Federation itself. These statements are not quite clear to me. I wonder what mill these people are providing grist for when they make strange comments on decisions of the leaders of Kazakhstan or events taking place in our country. Margarita Simonyan: Thank you. I even know some of the people you are referring to, but we will not continue this discussion here, at the economic forum. Vladimir Putin: Nonetheless, I will continue talking because this is important. I agree with my colleague. Look, in the current conditions, every agency and every country as a whole are certainly thinking of ways to avoid expenses. This absolutely natural. You have already mentioned some countries, but this applies to all states without exception. But it is always possible to find a solution to any problem at the working level, if there is a will. Russia and Kazakhstan have this will. I would like you to understand this. Kazakhstan is our ally in the broadest and most direct sense of the world. Now about artificial intelligence. It seems to me that, as of today, what you spoke of does reproduce its creator: this is what he thinks. Margarita Simonyan: Possibly. Maybe that is why he was suspended. Vladimir Putin: It seems to me that he thinks so, which is why his invention thinks so too. I think it is hard to reach the level of Homo Sapiens, I agree with the President of Kazakhstan. Is the ability to empathise, is a soul possible for a machine or not? Some experts believe that at some point empathy may arise. But in my opinion, it is too early to talk about it. Whether it would pose a threat to humanity or not is a difficult question that I do not know how to answer. I do not think I have the level of competence to answer that question, I am telling you frankly. But what is absolutely certain and what has just been said is that it cannot be stopped, it has to be taken as a given. Just like you cannot stop the sun rising or setting. Gunpowder was invented in China and everything was kept secret. And what? You cannot stop it. It is the same in nuclear technology, anywhere. Progress cannot be stopped. You do not have to try to stop the sun from rising, you just have to think how to deal with it: go tanning today or better abstain, cultivate wheat on this land or better do something else. You just have to start from there. Inevitably we should just adapt to it, not try to slow it down. If we try to slow it down, nothing good will come of it. And if we understand that it is inevitable, we will find ways to use the achievements of this progress for the benefit of humanity. It seems to me that this is the way to go. Margarita Simonyan: You know, some specialists, especially medical specialists who are connected with medicine will tell us that the ability to empathise is actually just a result of oxytocin, serotonin, neural reactions, a series of hormones called serotonin reuptake and it can be corrected simply by taking pills. A person may or may not be emotional depending on this. It is a difficult question, but an interesting one. Vladimir Putin: But it is there, this serotonin. Not yet in the machine, though. There could be something else there, but not that. Margarita Simonyan: And thank God. I am told that we should wrap up. Vladimir Putin: Management? Margarita Simonyan: Yes. Not yours, mine. The forum management, whom I work for temporarily as moderator of this panel. So, in conclusion I would like to share a joke with you. I do not know if you have heard it. As you might recall, I believe it was Obama who started calling countries by various nicknames; he called us a gas station country. But now that their gas prices have skyrocketed, Obama's ironic joke that we were a gas station country, is now repeated with envy. My last question is this. When will all this be over? They have their prognoses about us, and we have a prognosis about how long their economies will endure, how well their political system will endure, can it sustain this or not? How do you see it – this is certainly a question for both presidents – how do you see the world beyond this? Who in the world will be the poles in a multipolar world, and who are our friends and allies? Vladimir Putin: The US political elite looks down on everyone, often with inflated self-conceit inside; I have talked about this. However, this does not mean the United States is not a great power. This is a country that has become a world leader in a little over 300 years, and that deserves respect. It is, without doubt, a country with a great future, I have no doubt about that. But their domestic problems and the mistakes of the ruling elite, of course, make themselves felt precisely because their internal problems are growing. Their economy is swelling, which we can see in inflation, which I spoke about; they are growing in other areas in the economic sphere. You mentioned energy. Where did these prices come from? Are we raising prices? Nonsense. There are people here who have worked in energy and oil for almost all their lives. Are we raising the prices? The market is. And who rules the market? They do. And prices are going up as a result of their activities, that is all. And the same goes for gas. No matter how many times we tell them: ""Do not pay attention to the cash market. If you want spot – please, but long-term contracts give us an opportunity to invest confidently, and you can consistently receive energy resources at market prices linked to a basket of oil and oil products."" – ""No, we'll use the spot market."" Certainly, go buy it, it costs 1,500 euros per thousand cubic metres, while we sell it for five times less; in fact, we subsidise the European economy. And it is like this in everything. The same as in the States. I said that disagreements are escalating, and if policies like this continue, it will get worse. It seems to me that the American people (I have great respect for the American people), faced with problems that are growing due to their leaders' decisions, can still put their leaders in a position where the political and economic elites – above all the political elite, of course – have to respond to the demands of the people. Ultimately, relations will still be built properly both within these countries, including in the United States, and in the international arena. I am more of an optimist than a pessimist. Margarita Simonyan: It is good to know that you are more of an optimist than a pessimist. President Tokayev, what about you? Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: I believe that the world has indeed entered a crisis. After all, that is how the United Nations Organisation sees it. At the same time, it should be considered that the United States of America and the West in general have a significant safety margin when it comes to economic development. In this situation Americans appear to be, as it is common to say, beneficiaries, meaning that they are keeping back and, at the same time, feeling the consequences of this global crisis to a lesser extent. However, the US economy is, as I said, dynamically developing and modern. But I believe that our part of the world has great potential. My words about the Russian economy today were quite complimentary. Not because I am a guest here and must say positive things to my hosts but because it is true. I am a strong supporter of integration and regional cooperation. Of course, under no circumstances should we self-isolate and go on the defensive. Instead, we need to put ourselves out there in the markets. The President spoke about this rather convincingly today. After all, there are so many good and promising partners in the modern world. We just need to find them and build cooperation. It is good to see that right now, a number of countries are showing real interest in joining the Eurasian Economic Union in one role or another. Overall, we should stay optimistic. Margarita Simonyan: Thank you, President Tokayev, for being so incredibly honest about the DPR and LPR matter. Such honesty is rare at formal and official events. I think the deputies and people of culture that you mentioned, one of which knows me very well, heard your opinion. It is true that we should all understand that now is not the time to argue and bring grist to the mill of those who want to sow discord. Mr President, thank you very much. Thank you for spending this day with us. Thank you for not being embarrassed. And thank you for your confidence in our shared future. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Thank you, I appreciate it."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68666,Meeting on developing automobile industry,2022-06-16T20:25:00Z,St Petersburg,The President held a meeting to discuss the development of Russia's automobile industry.,"The meeting was attended by Deputy Prime Minister Yury Borisov, Presidential Aide Maxim Oreshkin, Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov, Minister of Economic Development Maxim Reshetnikov, Minister of Transport Vitaly Savelyev, Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov, Governor of the Central Bank Elvira Nabiullina, the heads of the Republic of Tatarstan, the Kaliningrad, Kaluga, Nizhny Novgorod, Samara and Tula regions and St Petersburg, General Director of KAMAZ Sergey Kogogin, General Director of Sollers Auto Nikolai Sobolev, AvtoVAZ President Maxim Sokolov and GAZ Group President Vadim Sorokin. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, Today our agenda includes the situation in the domestic automobile industry. We talk about it in one way or another all the time; today we will talk about it in a substantive way. Together with company directors and CEOs, we will see what difficulties Russian car manufacturers, car dealers and service centres are facing; we will discuss possible support measures for the industry and our further actions, given the situation today. I would like to point out that the car industry is traditionally tied to many related industries, related sectors of the economy, including the metals industry, chemicals, light industry and electronic equipment production. A number of contractors and suppliers were and still are located abroad, and this is not a peculiarity of our car industry only: this wide-spread cooperation and these long cross-border production chains are common world practice today Due to well-known circumstances and reasons, many of these ties have now been cut. Many of the Russian car industry's partners, despite their long-term commitments, have either suspended deliveries or have announced withdrawals from our market. Obviously, this demarche will have an impact on production output, and a noticeable one at that. This can already be seen – compared to a year earlier, in March, the domestic car industry output was three times lower, and in April it was five times lower. I would like to stress once again that the situation is not easy. You are well aware of this and understand it. I would like to ask the Government to elaborate on the operational measures proposed to support the automobile industry and stabilise the domestic market. At present, I consider two tasks the most important. The first one is to ensure the operation of car-making factories in Russia, supply them with necessary components, preserve jobs and teams of qualified specialists. In this context, I would like to recall that we have been implementing special import substitution programmes since 2014. I hope to hear today about the progress of work in this area. That said, I will repeat what we discussed at the previous sectoral meetings: obviously, we cannot focus only on the current problems of the automobile industry. Today, it is particularly important to develop strategic approaches to its growth and to set a long-term trajectory of technological and production changes that are based on people's need for high-quality affordable cars, the demands of the economy, businesses, the municipal economy for vehicles, including road, construction and utility equipment. It is also necessary to work towards ensuring Russia's technological sovereignty. Of course, this does not mean that all production processes in car-making must take place only here, in this country. However, key, critical elements, such as engineering designs, intellectual rights and know-hows, must certainly be Russian. The second task is to saturate our market, to provide a sufficient supply of vehicles, primarily cars, the prices for which have soared this year. I would like to recall that about a million and a half cars were sold in Russia during each of the past two years. However, this year car sales went down by a substantial 51 percent in the first five months of the year. In the meantime, according to experts, the reduction in sales should not exceed 20–25 percent if we want to avoid a sharp price rise. I would like to ask you to share your plans in this area – both as regards the delivery of new cars to dealers and customer support. I would also like to mention an issue that is a big headache for our car owners. It concerns car maintenance. Will the warranty rights of car owners remain valid? Where will they take cars for maintenance, and what is the status of spare parts supplies and the like? Let us discuss this issue today separately as well. I have another point to make. While the main challenge for the car market is limited supply, the commercial vehicle market may face low demand. Their main consumer is business and transport companies. Many of them have put their investment programmes on hold and are busy analysing the current market and logistics chains, including the ban imposed on Russian trucks to enter Europe. In this regard, I propose taking a broader look at various programmes to support demand for commercial vehicles. It goes without saying that their efficiency must be improved. An important remark in this regard. I am aware that Russian truck factories are realigning their production chains. Russian engine builders are replacing the suppliers that dropped out. Admittedly, for now, this replacement involves a decrease in the engines'environmental compliance class, which is more than a matter of environmental concernfor our urban areas and the regions, since it is also a factor of competitiveness. You are aware of what I am talking about, but still, I would like to note that even friendly countries, our Eurasian integration partners,set stringent environmental requirements for trucks. If we lower the environmental class of Russian trucks en masse, this could affect the market position of our carriers. They will simply be denied entry, which means that drivers will face employment issues. I would like the meeting participants to give their assessment of whether this is a system-wide problem and whether we need to adopt a special plan here. Last, at a recent meeting on transport industry, we discussed plans for developing roads and related infrastructure, including expanding the core network of highways in the constituent entities of the Federation. They connect regional and district centres, towns and villages, and are used on a daily basis. We agreed that we would bring at least 85 percent of the regions' roads, which are part of the core network, up to code over the next five years, something we must do no matter what. In the context of our meeting, I would like to note that it is important to understand not only what the roads will be like in terms of pavement quality and safety, but also what kind of transport will be using them, what kind of vehicles passengers will be using for their commuting needs, and what kind of cargo will be transported. In this regard, I would like to remind you of the instruction issued late last year which concerns upgrading the mass transit fleet in the regions, including trolleybuses and buses that service urban and suburban routes. I would like you to tell us how these plans will be implemented taking into account the current and future situation in the domestic auto industry. Let's get to work and start the discussion. <…> Vladimir Putin: Let us summarise some results. What would I like to single out? First, everything is clear – I will not talk about the importance of the industry. Every job here, I think, supports seven jobs in other sectors. Mr Borisov here is saying nine. Nine even, and that in itself speaks volumes about the importance of the industry. I am not even talking about its direct significance. Therefore, I ask the Government to draft and approve an updated development strategy for the automotive industry by September 1, taking into account current realities. And of course, the key element of that strategy should be for Russia to have its own critical technologies and production facilities, and their level should ensure the global competitiveness of our industry as a whole. Second. Today, manufacturers – my colleagues are sitting opposite me – spoke about the most pressing problems that limit their capabilities. First of all, it has to do with the supply of components. Of course, special attention needs to be paid to this. I will not go into detail now, there are a lot of details. Some problematic issues have been voiced, not all, but they have been voiced. This year, before the end of the year, everything must be done to prevent the situation from becoming extreme, critically urgent. Third. The passenger car market needs special attention now, of course, because there is a shortage of supply and prices have gone up sharply. I would also like to hear the thoughts of the finance minister – after all, metal prices are falling, the exchange rate has changed and it should certainly affect prices. I am not talking now about the other components pushing prices up – probably here we can also take some steps in the direction we need and, most importantly, in the direction people need. We need to ensure the affordability of passenger cars for citizens, and I ask the Minister of Industry to also look into this carefully, including with colleagues from our other departments – government agencies, of course, first and foremost. Let us come back to this again in the autumn, look at everything we draw up today in the form of instructions and see how it all works. Next, our colleagues also mentioned the demand for commercial vehicles, which, I agree, is critically important for the economy. I want you to focus on expanding the mass transit renewal programme. Representatives of the regions mentioned it as well. Actually, this makes sense. A reduction in the average age of the equipment must be the benchmark for improving the situation in this area. I certainly agree with what was said about NGV fuel. Cheap raw materials are undoubtedly our competitive advantage. Gazprom's efforts are not enough here. I would like our regional leaders to be aware of the fact that success in building filling stations largely depends on how this work is organised in the regions. Building a network is extremely important. If there is a network, there will be demand for the equipment; if no network is available, how are they going to fill their tanks? This is a key element. The situation in the automotive industry will then change overnight, because, as someone aptly noted, the level of environmental friendliness will immediately change and higher competitiveness in the business of hauling cargo that is bound by environmental regulations will follow. That way, our transport will face no restrictions. In closing, I would like to once again draw your attention to the fact that every decision that we make must be acted upon as quickly as possible without unnecessary red tape. Our colleagues from the industry have already extended their gratitude to the Government for making decisions faster, but we must work even faster and more efficiently given the circumstances. Most importantly, the scientific and technological progress of the industry is hands-down the key component and should be prioritised. Science, technology, and engineering centres are what we should engage in. In that case, our independence will be absolutely real and rely on a strong foundation of its own. Thank you very much. We will draft a resolution following our meeting today, and I hope it will be acted upon swiftly and effectively. Thank you."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68656,Meeting with Head of RUSNANO Sergei Kulikov,2022-06-15T14:00:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with Chairman of the Management Board of the RUSNANO Management Company Sergei Kulikov.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Kulikov, the company started working in its initial form in 2007. I believe that 150 enterprises have been established and about 40,000 jobs have been created since then. Let us talk about its overall performance. Chairman of the RUSNANO Management Company Management Board Sergei Kulikov: Yes, Mr President, you are quite right. You as the founder and ideological leader of this programme know better than anyone that RUSNANO is not a mere state corporation or joint-stock company, or even a development institution. It is a symbol of investment in science, technology and the future. I will try to focus on three aspects: technology, science and education, and money. It is true that 150 enterprises have been established, and nanotechnologies have taken root in six technology clusters, including electronics, materials, optronics and solid waste disposal. As for research, 53 billion rubles have been invested in R&D, and 1,500 students graduate each year from nanotechnology departments at 28 universities in the country. Just as we agreed in December, we have launched an initiative– not yet a programme– on the mathematical modelling of materials behaviour, which has yielded the first results in our advanced development models. We have done more than just begin: a laboratory at NUST MISIS has increased the capability of thermoelectric materials by 30–40 percent thanks to mathematical modelling. This year we have launched a new cycle with major players who are coming to see the fundamental importance of materials. As for finance, we are repaying our debt. We returned the first 20 billion rubles last year. We meet those who ask for a discount halfway, yet interest is accumulating. I have prepared several proposals. I will submit them to you later. And now, the good news: considering that 233 billion rubles have been invested in RUSNANO over the period you mentioned, by 2020 we earned 155 billion rubles by exiting some portfolios and assets. We increased that sum by another 50 billion rubles last year, overcoming the psychological barrier of 200 billion rubles and breaking even with investment costs. In our opinion, this is evidence of our company's overall profitability. As for being a symbol and not merely a joint-stock company, I would like to note that over the past decade we have proved the importance and accessibility of nanotechnology, and that competitive products cannot be created without researching the morphology of materials, as well as that it is worth investing in this. In fact, now is the right time to invest in this. What achievements can we report? First of all, they are three professions. Nanotechnologist: Frankly speaking, I personally tried to learn it without attending lectures, but I have come to the conclusion that it is better to do what I am good at, that is, create conditions for increasing the class of production engineers and nanotechnologists. Techpreneurs are another important profession. We have launched a start-up studio at ITMO University[National Research University] as part of the University Techpreneurship Programme under the umbrella of the Ministry of Education. It is already producing interesting results. Our plans for this year provide for launching 14 start-up studios. The goal is to cut the distance between idea and product. I can describe the third profession as R&D investors, the go-betweens linking business and science who know what projects money is allocated for and set the task to researchers, as well as those who look for interesting scientific ideas and raise funds for their implementation. Regarding our portfolio, we have 51 assets left, 18 of which can be described as distressed, like Liotech, a producer of lithium-ion batteries in Novosibirsk. Its story is as old as the world: it went bankrupt several times, we tried to re-register it, but only managed to preserve its intellectual asset, that is, employees. We have found a use for them: we are operating system energy storage facilities together with Rosseti Centre in 11 regions, and we ensured their almost seamless operation, without accidents, in small residential areas during the last autumn and winter season. We are now working on the next generation of these solutions. We have postponed our plans for selling 13 companies to 2023–2024 because they are needed now to support critical infrastructure. I will give a few examples. For instance, there is Novomet in Perm– a wonderful company producing bottomhole pumps for the oil industry. We hope that if we start assembling them, we can acquire the know-how to become an alternative supplier or replace those who are changing markets today. Russian Membranes in Vladimir, the heart and the basis for water treatment in general, not only desalination, which is used in the Gulf countries, our active partners, but also purification, which is particularly important today. As you know well, we have made agreements with two governors and are now working on relevant pilot projects. Optovolokno is a company in Saransk, Mordovia. We have agreed with the governor and the Ministry of Industry and Trade to develop it to… Vladimir Putin: You need input materials. Sergei Kulikov: Of course. We will now finish building one more production area to ensure sustainability. And, of course, three American and Japanese suppliers quit the market, and we are now competing only with the Chinese for a place in the energy cable and the telecoms cable market. It is difficult, but this is a very interesting task as well, and we can really grow. We have moved these assets aside, as it were, but we will adopt a strategy all the same to attract private investors to these efforts. Vladimir Putin: Is this realistic? Do you believe you can do this? Sergei Kulikov: We do not have a choice. How can we not do it? This is especially important in the current conditions: people must communicate, and networks must be managed. There is no choice– we must do this by any means. If there is something we cannot supply, we must then look for ways to produce it. We have prepared 20 assets for sale, including foreign ones. This applies to alternative energy assets, which you know about. We are quitting them and reconfiguring our teams to take on new tasks. In other words, our energy specialists will deal with small-scale generation, the same system energy storage facilities, that is, some hybrid solutions that may be used today. After leaving two waste incineration plants, we began to use this competence to look for breakthrough technologies. We discovered a great solution for ash-free recycling by building two reactors. Rosprirodnadzor[the Federal Service for Supervision of Natural Resources] is studying them thoroughly and is surprised by good results, but they are still testing to make sure there is no error. There are no emissions, because there is no combustion. I will show you this design after I finish my report. You are aware of the nanotube manufacturer that went all the way from a start-up business– the first four stages of technology maturation– to an IPO. This in fact highlights RUSNANO's function where we pick a project up from the first to the fourth phase and from the fourth to the eighth phase and then bring it to market or make it a strategic partner. We teamed up with the founders and made the nanotube usable in electric vehicle components this year and we are now doing pilot road tests. For example, we added nanotube technology to the asphalt on the Moscow–Don highway to see that no wheel track grooves were formed at 50 degrees Celsius. I think this deserves to be run as a separate project, perhaps, a 10-year or longer programme, in order to see how effectively our roads can endure. In the end, investors started coming to us and our portfolio grew by 30 percent last year. About 65 billion rubles of extra-budgetary funds have been received by RUSNANO before 2020. But last year alone, we attracted 68 billion, of which only 4 billion were our own funding, with the rest coming from outside sources. As for evolving,(as you may be aware, RUSNANO started as a state corporation and eventually became a joint-stock company), we are probably ready to think about public-private partnership. That is, we can increase the share of private investment in the newly created foundations. Based on our strategy, in the first half of its implementation we will be attracting funds at a rate of 1 to 4, that is, for every ruble of state or quasi-state money there will be 4 rubles from the outside, and 8 rubles by the end of the implementation period. The team was reset; we did this with respect to the founders. In fact, we are even forming the RUSNANO university club. We attracted multiple young colleagues, added competencies that we lacked, and are now using earlier achievements and the groundwork that we formed today for projects in the ecology, healthcare, mobility, energy and, of course, security. Vladimir Putin: You and I understand, though, that improving the financial situation is among our key goals in this regard. Sergei Kulikov: Yes, absolutely. <…>"

It is gratifying to note that you worthily carry on the lofty mission of your predecessors, making a significant contribution to improving the national fire-prevention infrastructure. The fight against fire is rightfully seen as the calling of brave people with tremendous willpower. Volunteers, energetic and concerned people who respond keenly to the troubles of others, are always at the forefront of this work, along with professional fire-fighters. Apart from putting out fires, you conduct highly essential educational, awareness-building and preventive work among the population, prioritising efforts to promote such values as everyday safety and respect for nature in society. And, of course, your activity aimed at educating the rising generation deserves special respect. The Young Firefighters movement has been established with your support, and its members serve with over 10,000 squads. Moreover, the Russian children's and youth national team for fire and rescue sports is the reigning world champion. I am confident that members of the All-Russian Volunteer Fire Society will continue to involve new volunteers in its work, and that it will successfully accomplish various objectives."""
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68652,Meeting with Accounts Chamber Chairman Alexei Kudrin,2022-06-14T13:55:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin had a meeting with Accounts Chamber Chairman Alexei Kudrin. They discussed the results of the oversight agency's performance.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Let us begin with the Accounts Chamber's performance. Accounts Chamber Chairman Alexei Kudrin Kudrin AlexeiChairman of the Accounts Chamber: Mr President, two events took place at the Accounts Chamber in the past month. First, we reported on our performance in 2021 at the Federation Council and the State Duma. Second, we have recently submitted our findings on implementing the 2021 budget to the State Duma. This substantial work was aimed at screening all the main managers of budgetary funding. In all, we audited over 90 managers in this category, and we completed this work in six, rather than nine, months for the first time. From now on, we can assess the Government's report in summer, during the spring session. Consequently, we are noting drawbacks and providing feedback that can be used to draft the budget for the following year, which will be submitted by the Government in September. Speaking of our performance, members of the Federation Council and the State Duma noted that the quality of our audits has improved; they also commented on the analytical aspects of our audits and achievements in improving their methodology. Actually, we devote more attention to the fact-finding aspects and argumentation in our audits. I can say right away that we exposed violations worth 1.5 trillion rubles last year alone; this concerns all our work and all audits. This mostly includes accounting violations, those linked with the misuse of funding and the violation of procurement proceedings. Speaking of procurement, this mostly implies efforts to calculate minimal and maximum procurement prices. We have now finished assessing the budget, and, of course, we noted the Government's truthful and transparent report. At the same time, we exposed violations worth 676 billion rubles, mostly accounting violations. Most of the violations were corrected during our audit because it is very important that every expenditure be recorded in the relevant item. Quite often, this includes the registration of properties and newly completed buildings. This registration procedure may be delayed by months and even years, and we noted these delays. We often remarked that yet unregistered buildings were being operated. But I would like to note that the Government has executed 97.5 percent of its budget– the highest percentage of spending in five years– even with the 2 trillion rubles added during the year to finance anti-crisis measures. As for the balance of accounts, the unexecuted expenditures, we have calculated at 645 billion– as a reminder, last year, it was 1 trillion. The remaining 645 billion mostly account for already secured contracts with payments to be made next year. There are certain unused funds, so far unaccounted for by any contract. Nevertheless, there is a positive trend to reduce this kind of unused balances. You have instructed us to assess the effectiveness of the national projects. The national projects are implemented through state programmes. The budget is structured by state programmes, so the quality of state programmes, in fact, confirms the quality of public administration. Every penny should be spent for a purpose and towards an objective. Therefore, we do not just audit the expenditures; we make sure that the established state programme targets are achieved. We proposed to the Government and the Ministry of Economic Development an innovative way to assess state programmes, to enhance the assessment of their efficacy in order to subsequently make decisions on their adjustment to make them more effective. For example, we noted that a significant part of the 1,500 targets set for all state programs are technical indicators. Only 22 percent of those targets are high-level indicators that show real results. The rest largely sound like""the number of entities receiving support."" So, they received state support, and then what? Or the number of events held– this does not confirm any result either. Therefore, we required that programmes be more result-oriented. And the figures indicating final results should grow. For example, 50 percent of a programme indicators are planned with dynamics close to zero– this means they do not grow. The same result is achieved from year to year, no increase. We also pointed this out. The number of unmet targets is decreasing; they do not exceed 20 percent, which constitutes good progress. Nevertheless, these 20 percent indicate underachievement in state programmes. However, I would like to note the most successful programmes: the agricultural development programme, the transport system development, nuclear engineering, and the Accessible Environment programme. We believe they are well-balanced, with good dynamics, the right final indicators, have fewer purely technical targets, and are better managed. The programme to develop space activities is, on the contrary, among those where we found shortcomings. Last year, the Government established a Reserve Fund, money that it can spend without changing the law. This is why we are particularly attentive to the expenses that the Government distributes within its authority without changing the law. Last year, this spending reached 4 trillion. The Reserve Fund is large now because of the need to respond promptly to the current situation. As a rule, these funds go for social support, anti-COVID measures, to responding to the consequences of emergencies and support for businesses in a crisis. I must say that everything is quite well defined, but there are still some minor violations that need attention. Maybe it is a good idea to finish my report by saying that in the past two years, when COVID broke out and we started re-adjusting our national projects, spending on the regions went up 1.5 times and more, sometimes even doubling. This funding for the regions reached 3.7 trillion rubles in 2020 and 3.6 trillion rubles in 2021. This is enormous support for the regions. At the same time, it appears that all these expenses are targeted, they seem to be'colour coded'. There are 347 subsidies like this, or to be more precise, targeted inter-budgetary transfers(this number increased from 197 to 347); there is an agreement for each one with every region or with most regions. We should note that now, a region's independence is decreasing because of the increase in targeted support. Moreover, a given region must add its own resources, which are limited, to the funds received. Vladimir Putin: In terms of our ultimate goals, maybe this makes some sense? Alexei Kudrin: We are drawing attention to the need to balance this out a bit. While before, a region was authorised to spend about 50 percent of all support, now it is 28 percent. Vladimir Putin: But the regions' opportunities are expanding and their revenues are also growing. Alexei Kudrin: Yes, their revenues are growing, and this is fair. But we are just saying, okay, we see the opportunities in keeping these expenses targeted, but maybe several subsidies(one state programme provides for three or four of them) can be consolidated, in which case a region will have to reach higher final figures. Incidentally, the State Council Commission on Inter-Budgetary Relations also suggests moving in this direction. So, we believe there is an opportunity for consolidation. This would also be a chance to increase non-targeted resources a bit. This would allow the governors to respond better to the problems that arise in their regions but that are not always visible from the top. In conclusion, I would, perhaps, like to mention several audits that were important last year. The Government, as a rule, responded to them and took into account our recommendations. Generally speaking, producing recommendations has become permanent practice for the Accounts Chamber. We give recommendations after each serious audit, and we list the opportunities we see for improving the effectiveness of some spending in a systematic way. There have been some 2000 recommendations over the last three years, and the Government has implemented approximately half of them. Thus, 503 of our recommendations were implemented last year. In other words, there is ongoing work with the Government to improve the entire system. For example, we conducted a large-scale review on reforestation. Unfortunately, reforestation here lags behind use and logging. Or take, for example, maternity capital. After collecting maternity capital, people are often unaware that they are entitled to adjustment benefits, which occasionally are remitted with a delay, and that they have several thousand, 20,000 or even 30,000 rubles in their bank accounts. We have found about 4.7 billion rubles that people knew nothing about and which lay on the shelf collecting dust. But now, this has been paid out. Another example is the State Information System in the housing and utilities sector and the Unified State Information System for the social security sector. The former should make it easier for people to apply for documentation or find out about the economic state of their residential building. The latter would expedite the provision of benefits or other social payments. Of course, we have found certain errors in terms of maintaining, updating and inputting information. This decreases the efficiency of these systems, particularly the State Information System in the housing and utilities sector, as they cannot be used in managerial decision-making as much. Relevant recommendations have been issued. Generally, 67 government agencies use 630 state information systems, and maintaining them in a current, efficient state is one of our self-appointed missions. We have audited the state of the efforts in the fight against the HIV infection, issued recommendations, and the Government has responded. We are investigating the state of affairs with housing for young orphans; there are still 280,000 orphans, who have not yet been provided with housing in a reasonable time. Last autumn, I reported to you on the fight against poverty and offered a number of proposals. We worked with the Government, and the proposals for targeted benefits for families with children aged from 8 to 17 are very timely measures. This year, given the problems in the economy, this will help the potentially destitute considerably, or even reduce the number of these people in this country. In conclusion, I would like to say that we, as I have said, are improving our analytical methods to see clearly whether the measures used by the Government have resulted in an improvement or if it is just a coincidence of some other trends in the economy. Differentiating the factors in any event in a stricter way is the serious work we are doing now. We use big data analysis and mathematical modelling. In general, we are making the Accounts Chamber's work more substantiated or more evidence-based. Vladimir Putin: Fine. Thank you very much."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68650,National Award and Hero of Labour medal presentation ceremony,2022-06-12T13:25:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow","As per tradition, at the St. George's Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace, on Russia Day, the President presented the Hero of Labour of the Russian Federation gold medals and the 2021 National Awards for outstanding achievements in science and technology, literature, and the arts, and for outstanding contributions to human rights protection.","President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Dear friends, colleagues, Greetings to you and to all citizens of this country on Russia Day. This is a national holiday that is dedicated to our country, that is filled with pride for its history and belief it its future. The importance of unity for our people, our society, our country is as clear to us today as ever. Our ancestors gifted us this unity, our loyalty to the Motherland, and a responsibility for its future. We know the strength of these century-old traditions, moral values, and spiritual foundations, which have reaffirmed themselves throughout the entirety of our multiethnic nation's thousand years of history, bringing us together today. Our nation has long considered this sincere and deep patriotic sentiment to be sacrosanct. We are proud of the achievements and combat victories of our ancestors, and all those who aspired to press forward and did so to make new discoveries and ensure progress for our Motherland, as well as those who defended it on the battlefield and cemented its well-deserved place in the world. In all these respects, Emperor Peter the Great, whose 350th birth anniversary we celebrate this year, holds a special place. Peter I is rightfully called a great reformer as he achieved profound transformations in various areas, above all in state governance and the economy, forming a powerful, invincible army and navy, with colossal breakthroughs in education, healthcare, and culture. Alexander Pushkin wrote in his poem that""now academic, now hero, now navigator, now carpenter, with an all-encompassing soul, he was an eternal worker on the throne"". Debate is still ongoing about Peter I and his reforms, yet one must admit that under his rule Russia became a strong and great world power. Today, we pay tribute to his mighty personality, the integrity of his character, his unique knowledge, audacity and perseverance in pursuing his plans, as well as his boundless and amazing loyalty to our Fatherland. These high sentiments of patriotism are inherent in all of you, my friends, colleagues, comrades– outstanding sons and daughters of Russia. First of all, I will name those upon whom the Hero of Labour title was conferred, an award that recognises the years-long significant merits of our country's citizens. Yury Barmakov, a prominent scientist in the area of microelectronics and computer-aided design systems, is rightly among them. He is famous not only as a founder of an unparalleled research school involved in the design of nuclear munitions and their control mechanisms, but also Mr Barmakov is the author of many ideas related to the use of defence technologies in the civilian sectors of the economy. Profound knowledge, experience and innovative approaches are also a trademark of Alexander Perkash. He dedicated his life to aircraft design and at present is a successful manager of one of the enterprises where equal care is given to increasing air equipment quality, modernisation of production, and developing the human resources potential. I am happy to present the Hero of Labour badge of honour to outstanding film director Nikita Mikhalkov, a person of staggering creative abilities, astounding capacity for work, and who possesses a very keen sense of Motherland. Each project by Nikita Mkhalkov throughout the decades, be it film, TV shows, or roles in theatre, became a milestone event in Russian culture and in the public life of our country. Among the Heroes of Labour is also a world-renowned cellist, Yury Bashmet. Despite a packed tour programme, the maestro devotes a lot of effort and time to supporting young talents, children. Raising new generations of masters in another field is what Vladimir Mikhailov, a dairy farm operator from Yakutia is doing. For over fifty years he has attained top results under the risky conditions of animal farming in the north, thereby making a big personal contribution to the food security of our country. The title of Hero of Labour is conferred to Rossiyskaya Gazeta columnist Irina Krasnopolskaya. She writes about Russia's achievements in medicine, always placing a premium on patients' interests, making it a point to get personally involved in the lives of the characters of her reports. Dear friends, It is with special feelings that I greet the National Awards winners. Nearly three centuries ago Peter I issued an order to institute the Academy of Sciences. Since that time, the works, research and discoveries of our scientists have been serving the progress of Russia and all of humankind. I am delighted to introduce today's winners of the National Awards in Science and Technology. Talented designer Vladimir Travush is rightly acclaimed as a master of high-rise construction. The reconstruction of the Ostankino Tower, the erection of Moscow City skyscrapers and the Lahta centre in St Petersburg, as well as the Olympic facilities in Sochi were made possible thanks to his precisely calculated masterful engineering solutions. Many years of work by the outstanding doctors David Zaridze, Alexander Rumyantsev and Ivan Stilidi were dedicated to the preservation of the health of our nation. Their research and broad medical practice in epidemiology, oncology, and haematology made it possible to create innovative methods of prevention and treatment of severe illnesses, which saved hundreds of thousands of lives. Efforts by Russian biologists Alexander Archakov and Andrei Lisitsa are also dedicated to healthcare. They are engaged in an extremely complicated task– analysing the proteins the human body is made of and designing their molecular profile, which will allow for detailed diagnostics of a person's health. This work is a major step in the global programme on human genome studies, which has united the efforts of around 20 countries, with Russian scientists being the unquestionable leaders according to a number of parameters. I am happy to see here the National Awards winners in Literature and Art, and among them Pavel Nikonov, a brilliant painter, one of the founders of the so-called""austere style"", which became symbolic of artists of the 1960s. His role is universally acknowledged in the progress of the Russian and world visual art, which he has dedicatedly served for almost 70 years. Gulzada Rudenko has been given the award for her contribution to the study, preservation, and popularisation of Russia's historical and cultural heritage. Under her leadership, the Yelabuga State Museum-Reserve has emerged as one of the leading museum complexes in Russia, and has served as an example of how to preserve historical heritage in a contemporary developing city. Viktor Moskvin's life is also connected with the preservation of Russia's history. Founder and director of the Alexander Solzhenitsyn House of Russia Abroad, he reconstructs the lost pages of our country's history, brings back names, facts, and archive materials, all of which make up the unique heritage of Russian emigration, and makes it all accessible by skilfully combining traditional museum formats with current multimedia technologies The Award for Achievements in Human Rights goes to Margartita Urmancheyeva, the founder of the St Petersburg Association of Civic Organisations for Parents of Disabled Children. I remember a public meeting with residents of Svetlogorsk where she spoke about the need to organise assisted living for people with disabilities. She was so convincing that her initiatives are now being implemented across the entire country. Another example of an empathic and active civil stance is the activity of Yelizaveta Oleshkina, winner of the National Award for Outstanding Achievements in Charity Work. Over 35,000 senior citizens are looked after by the Starost v Radost[Happiness in Old Age] Charity Foundation, which she established and heads. It is Yelizaveta Oleskina that originally proposed that a system of long-term care for the elderly and those who are unable to live without assistance be created. This system is currently being introduced in 24 regions across the country. The National Award for Outstanding Achievements in Humanitarian Activity was awarded to Metropolitan Korniliy of Moscow and All Russia of the Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church. I would like to emphasise his tremendous contribution to the harmonisation of relations between the state and all faiths, to the promotion of the inter-faith dialogue, and to the protection and advancement of traditional values. Metropolitan Korniliy is also widely known for his tireless educational efforts and his desire to strengthen international spiritual ties and improve interaction with compatriots abroad. Dozens of Old-Rite families have returned to Russia under his immediate guidance and connected their future and the future of their children with their historical |Motherland. Friends, Each of you is one of a kind, and each of you has his or her own road to success. But you are all similar in that you are greatly talented, exceptionally hardworking, and sincerely devoted to your causes. Your brilliant achievements are a paragon of loyalty to your calling and your civil duties. I will allow myself to say, without exaggeration, that the entire nation is proud of you. I congratulate you again from the bottom of my heart on the high awards of the Motherland and I wish you all the very best. Thank you for our attention. <…> Vladimir Putin: Friends, colleagues, We are having a festive and grand ceremony. In his speech, Nikita Mikhalkov conveyed to us an amazing thing, an amazing tale of how the times and generations are connected. One of his ancestors was a seal-bearer of the first Tsar of the Romanov dynasty. At about the same time, which is recorded in church documents, my ancestors were plain peasants, and later common workers. It is a great honour for me to be present at today's ceremony. But as they used to say in olden times, it is the connection of the city and the countryside, the connection of science, creativity, real production, the arts, and showing care for people, the connection between our traditional brotherly and sisterly religions– all of this makes us a cohesive, powerful, invincible, and forward-looking people. Yury Bashmet said that he is trying to persuade himself that he is indeed a hero. Today's winners, Heroes of Labour and Heroes of Russia, do not need to persuade themselves that they are heroes and outstanding citizens of our country. It is enough that the country recognizes this and thanks you for your labour, for your deeds, and for your results. We are very hopeful that you carry on, now and in the future, making yet another huge contribution to Russia's development. Thank you. Happy holiday!(Russian anthem playing)"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68613,Statements for the press following Russia-Turkmenistan talks,2022-06-10T15:45:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin and President of Turkmenistan Serdar Berdimuhamedov made press statements following Russia-Turkmenistan talks.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ladies and gentlemen, colleagues, The talks with the President of Turkmenistan were quite substantive and were held in a business-like, friendly atmosphere, underscoring that our mutually beneficial cooperation is a true partnership. The current year is a noteworthy one for relations between Russia and Turkmenistan. In April, we celebrated 30 years of diplomatic relations and 20 years since the signing of the fundamental bilateral Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, which is a solid foundation of our multifaceted cooperation. The Declaration on Deepening the Strategic Partnership that we have just signed sets forth priorities for future political, trade, investment, cultural, humanitarian and security cooperation, including biological and cyber security. I would like to note that Russia is one of Turkmenistan's key economic partners. Last year, our trade amounted to US$865 million and in the first quarter of this year, it went up by another 45 percent. The Russia-Turkmenistan Inter-Governmental Commission on Economic Cooperation is successfully working to diversify trade and investment exchanges and investment opportunities. Its Russian co-chair visited Ashgabat not so long ago to discuss promising joint projects and ways of expanding the use of national currencies in bilateral settlements. Energy remains a key sector of the bilateral partnership and was the focus of our discussions today. Both sides showed interest in establishing cooperation between Russia and Turkmenistan's energy agencies and supporting the business community's initiatives to follow through on current mutually beneficial undertakings. Notably, Gazprom is cooperating with Turkmengas concern for exports of gas from Turkmenistan under a long-term contract with an option for Russia to buy gas from Turkmenistan. LUKOIL is negotiating the terms of participation as an operator of the Dostluk oil and gas condensate field development project in the Caspian Sea. TATNEFT has been successfully engaged in repairs and maintenance of oil wells in Turkmenistan for a long time now. The introduction of the latest Russian technology has led to a significant increase in oil fields' productivity and more new jobs. Other major Russian energy and industrial companies, such as Inter RAO and Silovye Mashiny[Power Machines], are interested in carrying out projects in Turkmenistan as well. We are talking about upgrading existing power plants and building new ones, including the use of renewable energy sources, the construction of high-voltage overhead lines, and electricity transit and export. During the talks we also touched upon such important topic as the further promotion of industrial cooperation. We noted the successful implementation of a number of major joint projects. The construction of a multi-purpose dry cargo ship for Turkmenistan by the United Shipbuilding Corporation is one such joint project. Two high-speed passenger ships have already been handed over to Turkmenistan, and plans are in place to build several passenger-and-freight ferry boats. Russia's Transmashholding has built two locomotives for Turkmenistan Railways, and a contract for five more was signed in March. KAMAZ has increased its deliveries to Turkmenistan's market with about 2,000 trucks delivered last year. A new corporate training centre opened in the city of Turkmenbashi. Both sides expressed willingness to pursue more large-scale initiatives in the construction industry. The Russian company Vozrozhdenie is already successfully operating in Turkmenistan. The President spoke highly of its work. It has built road and transport infrastructure worth over US$1.5 billion over the past 10 years and is now building a mudflow protection system outside Ashgabat. The work is nearing completion. It is gratifying that Russia and Turkmenistan are working as partners in the fight against the spread of the coronavirus. Last year, Turkmenistan was supplied with 330,000 Sputnik V vaccine kits, and this January 800,000 doses of Sputnik Light, including 300,000 free of charge. The President of Turkmenistan and I have agreed to further promote comprehensive development of bilateral cultural contacts between our citizens and encourage scientific, educational, cultural and sports exchanges. We are grateful to the leadership of Turkmenistan for caring about the Russian language and Russian culture. The joint Pushkin Russia-Turkmenistan secondary school in Ashgabat– a leading educational institution in the country with instruction in Russian– has been successfully operating for 20 years, where teaching is carried out according to Russian state educational standards and textbooks. The President expressed his interest in expanding this school, for which I am very grateful. We will support this in every possible way. By the way, Russia is actively helping Turkmenistan to train highly-skilled personnel in various areas. Russian education is consistently popular among Turkmen youth. Currently over 30,000 students from Turkmenistan are studying in Russia, including over 4,300 with budgetary support. The President raised an idea– a very good idea, and of course we will support it– to establish a joint Russia-Turkmenistan university. Of course, during the talks we also discussed the most pressing regional and international problems. Our states' positions on most of them are traditionally close or the same. I would like to stress that Russia respects the neutral status of Turkmenistan and its leadership's ambition to promote stable and sustainable development in the Central Asian region and the world in general. Based on this, we will continue to cooperate at multilateral platforms. We are grateful to our Turkmenistani partners for their consistent support of many Russian initiatives at the United Nations, including those directed against attempts to glorify Nazism and falsify history. We welcome the growing interest of our Turkmenistani colleagues in the ongoing integration processes at the Eurasian Economic Union and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Turkmenistan has close trade and economic relations with EAEU and SCO members. Moscow and Ashgabat are cooperating closely within the CIS. The Central Asian Five plus Russia is a promising cooperation format as well. Mr Berdimuhamedov and I discussed in detail ways to strengthen cooperation in the Caspian Sea region. Russia and Turkmenistan believe that working as a team with the Caspian states in matters of ensuring security, deepening economic partnership, preserving natural resources and maintaining ecological well-being is highly important. Preparations for the Sixth Caspian Summit in Ashgabat and the Second Caspian Economic Forum in Moscow are underway. When exchanging views on the situation in Afghanistan, both sides noted the importance of ensuring stability and security in that country, resolving pressing socioeconomic issues and neutralising threats, primarily terrorism, emanating from Afghan territory. We are ready to continue to work together with Turkmenistan and our other partners, including as part of the Moscow format of consultations– Russia, India, Iran, the United States, China, Pakistan and the five Central Asian republics– on the post-conflict rebuilding of Afghanistan, and to help that country integrate into regional infrastructure and supply chain projects. However, we firmly believe that the United States and its allies, whose 20-year presence in that country has brought it to a critical state, should assume the bulk of obligations, primarily financial, to rebuild Afghanistan. I asked our guest to convey our warmest greetings and wishes of good health and success to Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov. Over many years of working together, we have developed truly friendly, comradely relations. As the President of Turkmenistan and now as the head of the upper house of the country's parliament, he has always contributed to promoting partner-like and mutually beneficial Russia-Turkmenistan cooperation. In conclusion, I would like to express confidence that today's talks will further strengthen Russia-Turkmenistan relations for the benefit of our two friendly, fraternal nations. Thank you very much for the attention. President of Turkmenistan Serdar Berdimuhamedov Berdimuhamedov SerdarPresident of Turkmenistan: Ladies and gentlemen, During our current visit, we discussed with the President the state and prospects of bilateral cooperation. Speaking about our bilateral ties, I would like to emphasise that they are on the upswing and are developing dynamically and consistently. Owing to our joint efforts, relations between Turkmenistan and the Russian Federation are on an upward trend. They are distinguished by equality, mutual respect, openness, trust and mutual understanding of the importance of further strengthening friendship and cooperation between our two nations and peoples. Our state has sufficient potential to increase trade and investment and implement joint projects in industry, transport energy and agriculture, to name a few. In recent time, we have noticeably stepped up our cultural, scientific, humanitarian and educational ties. Both states are doing all they can to support these processes and are creating the necessary conditions for meeting the growing mutual interest in the history, culture and arts of both countries. They are encouraging broad contacts in these areas. Turkmenistan and the Russian Federation provided a brilliant example of solidarity during the coronavirus pandemic. We are grateful to the leadership of the Russian Federation for promptly responding to our inquiry about supplies of the vaccine, medications and medical equipment and support for citizens of Turkmenistan who happened to be in Russia in this difficult period. We signed a package of bilateral documents on current areas of cooperation. I am convinced that this meeting will give a major boost to our strategic partnership, creating new opportunities for promoting political, trade, economic, cultural and humanitarian ties. Ladies and gentlemen, Turkmenistan and the Russian Federation will continue close bilateral and multilateral cooperation in the Caspian Sea. We highly value Russia's participation in Caspian summits and its contribution to achieving key agreements. We agreed to continue our political and diplomatic dialogue, the main goal of which is to help ensure regional and global security and stability. I am convinced that this visit has confirmed the durability of the strategic partnership between Turkmenistan and the Russian Federation. I have invited the President of Russia to pay an official visit to Turkmenistan at his convenience. I would like to use this opportunity to thank Mr President once again for his tireless attention and a tremendous personal contribution to the promotion of bilateral ties. Thank you for your attention."

After the discussion in a restricted format, Russia-Turkmenistan talks continued in a working breakfast format. After the talks, the Russian President presented the President of Turkmenistan the Order of Friendship, a national decoration of the Russian Federation. Following the top-level talks, a Declaration on Deepening Strategic Partnership between the Russian Federation and Turkmenistan was signed. Also the parties signed intergovernmental agreements on preventing, identifying and curbing suspicious financial transactions by participants in foreign economic activity and on cooperation in the sphere of plant quarantine. In addition, the Russian and Turkmenistani representatives signed interdepartmental memorandums on cooperation in transport and transit, communications and IT, the construction sector, and banking supervision, as well as other documents on trade, economic, scientific, technical, social, cultural and humanitarian cooperation. In addition, Vladimir Putin and Serdar Berdimuhamedov made statements for the press.  Serdar Berdimuhamedov's official visit to Russia is his first foreign trip after his inauguration as the President of Turkmenistan on March 19, 2022. * * * Beginning of conversation with President of Turkmenistan Serdar Berdimuhamedov President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Berdimuhamedov, I am very glad to see you. Welcome to Russia. We are very pleased that you are making your first foreign state visit to our country. This is yet another indication of our special relationship. Thanks to your predecessor in this high post, Mr Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, we advanced our cooperation to a truly strategic level. Today, we will also sign a very important document concerning our further relations. I would like to note that, over the year of the pandemic, our mutual trade, unfortunately, declined slightly, by just over 10 percent. But currently, despite all the external difficulties, we have increased our trade by more than 40 percent over the first quarter [of 2022]. It is very significant progress. Only recently, we celebrated several anniversaries, including 30 years of our diplomatic relations. Russia and Turkmenistan develop their relationships across all areas and I am pleased to note that they are, not formally but genuinely, strategic. We are delighted to see you. Welcome. And, of course, please pass on my best wishes of future success and, naturally, good health to the former president and my good friend [Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov]. President of Turkmenistan Serdar Berdimuhamedov: Thank you very much. Mr President, First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to you for your invitation to visit the Russian Federation. This is my first visit to the Russian Federation as the President of Turkmenistan. Also, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you and all Russian people on the upcoming Russia Day. I wish you peace, well-being and prosperity. Mr President, This year, as you correctly noted, we are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Turkmenistan and the Russian Federation. Over these years, our bilateral ties have expanded in the widest range of areas. I would also like to note that this year, we are marking 20 years of the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between Turkmenistan and the Russian Federation that we signed in Ashgabat. This document became an important milestone in the history of relations between our states and contributed to the development of Turkmenistan-Russia relations based on mutual respect, trust and consideration of each other's interests. Taking this opportunity, I would like to congratulate you, Mr President, on these two anniversaries and express my gratitude to you for your personal contribution to the expansion and strengthening of bilateral ties between Turkmenistan and the Russian Federation. I want to thank you for the warm welcome and your hospitality. Mr Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov also sent his best regards and I would like to convey them to you. Thank you very much. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. I know that your visit includes many events. I know that yesterday there were meetings between the ministers and deputy prime ministers. This always happens as part of a top-level visit. All colleagues get together and do a lot of work, and I am sure that, in addition to the Declaration we are signing today, the entire range of joint work done during your visit will definitely benefit and advance our relations. Thank you. Serdar Berdimuhamedov: Mr President, I would also like to note that Turkmenistan and the Russian Federation are maintaining a high level of political, diplomatic, trade, economic, cultural and humanitarian cooperation based on strategic partnership. To date, Turkmenistan and the Russian Federation have signed 288 international documents, including such fundamental ones as the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation and the Treaty on Strategic Partnership. As for trade and economic ties, I would like to note that the Russian Federation is one of Turkmenistan's largest trade partners. We maintain economic cooperation not only in energy, but also in industry, transport, infrastructure development and other spheres. Today, Turkmenistan is not only buying large batches of automobile, marine and aviation equipment from Russia, but also offers Russian companies an opportunity to take an active part in the implementation of economic projects in our country. I would like to point out that one of the main spheres of bilateral cooperation is our interaction in culture and humanitarian activities, primarily in education, culture and healthcare. Partner relations with Russian regions are playing a major role in bilateral cooperation. I would like to note our productive interaction with the Republic of Tatarstan, St Petersburg, the Astrakhan Region and other entities of the Russian Federation. Interparliamentary ties are among the main areas of bilateral cooperation. There are good contacts between the deputies of the lower house (Mejlis) of the National Council of Turkmenistan and members of the Federation Council and deputies of the State Duma of Russia. I would also like to mention the successful first Interparliamentary Forum [of the Central Asian nations and the Russian Federation] and the first Dialogue of Women of Central Asia and Russia, which were held on May 12 and 13 in Ashgabat. The Interparliamentary Forum provided a platform for strengthening cooperation between the legislative authorities of our countries. Mr President, I would like to point out once again that Turkmenistan is paying considerable attention to cooperation with the Russian Federation. I would like to take this opportunity to invite you to make an official visit to Turkmenistan at your convenience. Once again, thank you for a warm and hospitable welcome. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. I will definitely take advantage of your invitation. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68606,"Meeting with young entrepreneurs, engineers and scientists",2022-06-09T18:20:00Z,Moscow,"In advance of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, Vladimir Putin met with young entrepreneurs, engineers and scientists who will be attending the SPIEF. The meeting took place at the Tekhnograd Innovative and Education complex at VDNKh.","Excerpts from the transcript of a meeting with young entrepreneurs, engineers and researchers President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends. I am very happy to see you, Today, as we see, we are at VDNKh– a large park complex where all of Russia's best achievements in all major spheres of development have traditionally been presented for decades: achievements that have always been Russia's pride, that have helped it stay at the leading edge of development. We can say that over the last several decades our country has come a very long way in transformation and change, and this very complex of achievements– VDNKh– shows this progress in Russia. You are young, but perhaps many of you know that this centre of achievements from Soviet times fell into a state of disrepair and was used for a cheap marketplace, but gradually, as the situation in the country improved, so did VDNKh. And now here we are, reviving the basic idea on which this exhibition centre was founded, which provides a place for you and people like you– young, beautiful, good-looking, smart, creative, and ambitious– to demonstrate your achievements. This is happening on a new basis, but still in a variety of areas. Our meeting is being held in advance of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, and I have asked my office and my colleagues from the Government to organise this meeting to hear your ideas on where we are now, where we are going and what we need to do to ensure our absolute and unconditional progress, to make it beneficial for the country and everyone involved in this remarkable process. And I promise that I will try to respond to all your proposals and ideas. It is easier for me to do this than for you. I just give instructions; you need to come up with ideas, while I just need to listen to you and give instructions.(Laughter.) This will certainly help me and my colleagues understand how we should organise work at the St Petersburg Economic Forum. I would like to begin by saying the following. We live in an era of change; this is obvious to everyone; everyone understands and sees this. Geopolitical, scientific and technological transformations are happening. The world is changing, and it is doing so rapidly. In order to claim some kind of leadership– I am not even talking about global leadership, I mean leadership in any area– any country, any people, any ethnic group should ensure their sovereignty. Because there is no in-between, no intermediate state: either a country is sovereign, or it is a colony, no matter what the colonies are called. I am not going to give any examples so as not to offend anyone, but if a country or a group of countries is not able to make sovereign decisions, then it is already a colony to a certain extent. But a colony has no historical prospects, no chance for survival in this tough geopolitical struggle. There has always been such a struggle(I just want to make it clear); it is not that we are looking at what is happening around us and saying""Wow!"" It has always been like that, you see, and Russia has always remained at the forefront of ongoing events. Yes, there were eras in the history of our country when we had to retreat, but only in order to mobilise and move forward, concentrate and move forward. Sovereignty, in the modern sense of the word– actually, it has always been like that, but it is particularly clear today– comprises several components. First, there is military-political sovereignty, and here, no doubt, it is important to be able to make sovereign domestic and foreign policy decisions and to ensure security. Second is economic sovereignty where the development of the basic sectors of the economy does not depend on anyone in terms of critical technology or matters that underlie the viability of society and the state. Technical sovereignty and social sovereignty are critically important in today's world. I am talking about the ability of society to come together to resolve national challenges, to respect history, culture, language, and all the ethnicities that share a single territory. This consolidation of society is one of the core conditions for growth. Without consolidation, things will fall apart. There may be other components of sovereignty, I gave you the basic ones, and it is clear that all these things are interconnected. I gave you a list of four components. In fact, you could reverse the order and start from the last one and go backwards, and then list them randomly, because one cannot exist without the other. How do you achieve external security without technological capability and technological sovereignty? It is impossible. We would never have hypersonic weapons if it were not for the capabilities of our science and industry. Never. You understand that fully only when you start dealing with these things directly. So, when we got hypersonic weapons, I asked for a list of developers to give awards to. I have already said this publicly before, but I will tell you again. They brought me a thick folder. I started flipping through it, but I saw that there were no peoples' names, only names of enterprises, design bureaus and research institutes. Frankly, even I was surprised. I asked the person who brought it to me what it was all about. He said that without even one name on that list, the product would not have been possible. Thousands of people worked on it, see? Thousands. And then I realised the depth and the capabilities of our defence industry. The same is true of the economy in general. A limping, sneezing and coughing economy is the end of it. What kind of consolidation of society can we then talk about? And if there is no consolidation, there will be nothing else, either. In order to be able to effectively possess and use all of that, it is necessary to address basic tasks, such as demography, which means healthcare, environment, research, education and upbringing, which is very important. Some time ago I had a discussion with the Patriarch about education, and he happened to say that even though education was indeed crucial, without proper upbringing we would not succeed at anything, because you can teach a person something, but the question is how they will use their knowledge. Science, education, upbringing, and health care are critically important, because without them demographic issues cannot be resolved, and so on. What about culture? If we do not rely on the basic values of the national cultures of the peoples of Russia, we will not consolidate our society. Without consolidation, everything will fall apart. And the fact that we have to sort of defend ourselves and fight for it is obvious. We visited the exhibition dedicated to the 350th birth anniversary of Peter the Great. Almost nothing has changed. It is a remarkable thing. You come to this realisation, this understanding. Peter the Great waged the Great Northern War for 21 years. On the face of it, he was at war with Sweden taking something away from it… He was not taking away anything, he was returning. This is how it was. The areas around Lake Ladoga, where St Petersburg was founded. When he founded the new capital, none of the European countries recognised this territory as part of Russia; everyone recognised it as part of Sweden. However, from time immemorial, the Slavs lived there along with the Finno-Ugric peoples, and this territory was under Russia's control. The same is true of the western direction, Narva and his first campaigns. Why would he go there? He was returning and reinforcing, that is what he was doing. Clearly, it fell to our lot to return and reinforce as well. And if we operate on the premise that these basic values constitute the basis of our existence, we will certainly succeed in achieving our goals. You are experts in your fields, and I want to apologise upfront if I am unable to answer some of your questions. As a matter of fact, I would like to listen to your ideas in order to keep them in mind when organising the St Petersburg Economic Forum rather than turn our meeting into a Q&A session. I would like to close my lengthy monologue with that and turn the floor over to our moderator. Please go ahead. <…> Vladimir Putin:(following up on remarks by Polina Morozova, Skoltech postgraduate student and materials chemist who works on developing new-generation K-ion batteries for uninterruptible power supply for fixed systems) The first thing I would like to point out is that you used the term""closed economy."" Our economy will not be closed. We have never had one and never will. If anyone is trying to limit us in any way, they are limiting themselves in the first place. For the sake of argument– this has nothing to do with you, but nonetheless– they are trying to put limits on our fertiliser exports only to see prices in their countries go up more than here. They tried to limit our energy exports and, again, prices went through the roof. They are already using my name instead of inflation when we have absolutely nothing to do with it.(Laughter.) Seriously. That is the truth. We have absolutely nothing to do with it. This is the outcome of their mistakes, long-term ones at that, which they talked about every year even before today's developments. They made these mistakes themselves, and are now– excuse me, ladies– trying to cover a certain part of theirs, trying to turn this around on Russia, claiming that Russia is to blame for everything. We have nothing to do with it. They imposed restrictions and pursued their energy policies for years and decades on end, which led to the current state of affairs. And then they started imposing sanctions and aggravated the situation in these and other areas even more. Your field is important and promising. Storing and transmitting energy using the latest high-tech methods is the future in the economy in general, in individual industries, and in the defence industry. Are you working on batteries? Polina Morozova: Yes. Vladimir Putin: We know what we are talking about: silent submarines and so on. This has an extremely broad range of applications. In addition to oil and gas, rare earth metals are also here. Should you need any additional support, we are here to help. The Ministry of Industry and Trade has a programme to support non-resource exports. We will expand these forms of support. As for""the closed economy"" as you said, I would like to say this again that we did not have a closed economy. That is, we had it in Soviet times when we isolated ourselves by creating the so-called Iron Curtain. We created it with our own hands. But we are not going to do this again and fall into the same trap. Our economy will be open. Those who do not want it will steal from themselves. They are already stealing from themselves and creating problems. If they continue following this path, they will just make a bad situation worse. Yes, we will be short of something because those who are doing this do have certain competitive advantages, especially in modern technology. This is clear. However, the world is big and diverse. You have just mentioned China and India. But why just China and India? What about Latin America? Yes, Africa may be still""asleep"" today but it is""waking up."" About 1.5 billion people live there. And what about the whole of Southeast Asia? You should understand that it is impossible to build a fence around such country as Russia from the outside. And we are not going to build such a fence around our country. But it is certainly necessary to help such start-ups as yours to enter world markets. We will be doing this, even more so since our trade and economic ties with these countries are making steady headway. I think our trade with China is already US$140 billion. I believe during the past year our trade with China increased by 34 percent and with India by 87 percent. Do you understand? And do you know how much our trade with Turkey has gone up in the first half year? It increased 2.3 times. It is clear why but it has its own problems– high inflation and so on but it is developing and has advantages of its own. If we work with each other and we want to do this, there is only upside. The same is true of BRICS. Two-thirds of the planet's population live in the regions I mentioned. Yes, some countries are only taking their first steps in some areas but they are taking them and will continue. Economic growth rates in these countries, in Asia, were about 5 percent, in the United States 1.7 percent and in the Eurozone 1 percent in the past ten years. We also have our own problems and we are aware of them but we will keep moving rather than hide behind some fence. But it is necessary to help people like you and we will. I will certainly discuss this with the Government and relevant structures that are in charge of supporting exports in our country. It is necessary to expand this support and we will definitely do so. <…> Yury Shilov: This question is frequently asked by young entrepreneurs: what, in your opinion, are three key qualities a leader should possess? Vladimir Putin: Three qualities… This applies to all walks of life, science, whatever you like, even education and politics. First, you have to be devoted to your work. I know that, perhaps, many will not like hearing it but, for example, in science, there was a well-known married couple, Marie and Pierre Curie, who sacrificed their health, life, absolutely everything, to achieve something they devoted their lives to. In education, our prominent teachers in the 1930s devoted their lives to children and achieved outstanding results. There were nuclear and rocket projects in our recent history… Sergei Korolev, Igor Kurchatov– they dedicated their lives to what they were doing and, in fact, they lived and breathed it. This does not mean that you should confine yourselves to living in a sort of box. Clearly, you should have broad knowledge but still, to a certain extent, you should be devoted to your profession and dedicate your lives to it. Second, flexibility is important and the ability to soundly and objectively assess the results of your work and have respect for people with whom you are trying to achieve goals to which you devoted your lives. Be critical but constructive, and you can mobilise a team. The ability to work in a team, especially if you lead a team, is a key element of success. That is basically it. <…> Vladimir Putin:(in response to the remarks by Anna Krasavina, a research fellow of the Dukhov National Automatics Research Institute in charge of developing analogue systems for long-distance fibre-optic data transfer. As a developer, she is concerned over Russian microelectronics) Our Government has been trying for several years to launch or recreate Russia's microelectronics industry. This is a complicated issue and one of the hardest blows at Russia in this entire array of restrictions. Actually, it has always been this way since the times of the Peter the Great. The ships he built, the methods of their construction and so on were largely secret in his time. So, Peter went to the West and acquired this knowledge by working as a carpenter. This continued throughout our history. COCOM lists in Soviet times and the like. It was like this even in the best years of our cooperation with our so-called Western partners. Restrictions were preserved. Now they have simply ratcheted them up, and this is one of the main blows. We decided we could sell oil and gas and buy everything cheap. In fact, we funded their work with our cheap energy resources. This is broadly speaking, of course, but it is essentially what happened. And so, owing to these restrictions, we are compelled, thank God, to develop our own engineering schools, including in this area. I will also take everything you said from the transcript of our conversation today and I will talk to the Prime Minister about this, because he is personally dealing with this problem at my request. <…> Vladimir Putin:(answering a question from Arkady Didkovsky, head of the talented youth department, Bauman Moscow State Technical University, on what the technological Russia should look like in ten years) I believe that if we think like Tsiolkovsky, that we will fly to the stars, then we really will. And we were the first to fly there in human history. This is why such seemingly unbelievable and crazy ideas move the world forward. As for what we should strive for in the field of science and technology, there are things that seem to be complicated, and you can talk about them all night, until the next morning. But if you look at the tasks, what tasks do we have? Demography is the first task. We need more people, and they must be healthy. Here we have to address an entire range of issues: development of medicine, medical equipment, pharmaceutics, modern medications that will work effectively against those diseases that are already resistant to antibiotics, and so on. And this includes end-to-end, quantum and big data technologies. By the way, although they are constantly trying to somehow pinch and insult us, implying that we are a petrol station country, in terms of processing big data, we have overtaken many. Yes, there are things that we can be proud of even today, of course. This is why we should try to acquire new competences in everything related to people's lives and health: medicine, ecology, end-to-end technologies, big data processing again, quantum technologies, including creating modern engineering centres on a new basis, and then we would be leaders in all these areas. Do we have a chance? Of course, we do. We have a tradition of education that many countries lack. We have excellent scientific schools, including on mathematics. This is the foundation of all modern technologies. There are problems and issues that must be addressed in all these spheres. But we have ways to do so, and if we continue to go along this path then we will surely succeed. Arkady Didkovsky: So will we live better in ten years? Vladimir Putin: Yes, in the end this should result in an higher quality of life, that is correct. <…> Vladimir Putin:(in response to remarks by Yekaterina Kudashkina, holder of master's degree in agriculture, and her proposal to build an innovative selection centre involving young agriculture scientists to create new types of Russian crops and oil-bearing crops to meet market demand) First, I would like to say that this is a very interesting, relevant and important area of activity. I cannot help but remember your colleagues who worked in Leningrad under siege. It was an extraordinary story about people who starved to death but preserved collections of seeds. Many people know about this but it is a topic in and of itself that deserves to be the subject of books and films. Our film industry has addressed this matter to some extent but it deserves to always be remembered. This is my first point. Second, as concerns domestic seeds, it is indeed a relevant matter because, as with many other areas of activity, we have forgotten something here. But we have a solid basis to build on. For example, as far as I understand and as you will probably confirm, when it comes to wheat, our seeds are 100 percent domestic. And it is not a coincidence at all that in the past years, Russia has become a leader in annual sales of wheat. Yes, other countries such as China with 1.5 billion people and the United States with over 300 million, they produce more but they also consume more. Meanwhile, our export potential has proven quite serious. We had 20 million tonnes, then 30 million tonnes, in 2021–2022, we are to reach around 37 million tonnes soon and in another two or three years, it will be 50 million tonnes. So we are boosting production. Hopefully, this year– and it is very important, perhaps the most important thing– we will harvest over 130 million tonnes. It is extremely important. But overall, two-thirds of our domestic seeds are currently in use. In the next couple of year, we must reach at least 75 percent. We should move carefully, knowing our exact capacity and in light of that, progress gradually. We will, absolutely, do this because we need to move forward with both animal and seed farming to produce different crops. But I must note– and you have just mentioned it– that since 2014, we have significantly increased our capacities in agriculture. Agricultural production in Russia has grown 15 percent since 2014 while food production has increased 30 percent. This is very serious progress. But the area you have just mentioned remains if not a weak spot, then something we must address. As concerns the centres you mentioned, they are already being created, and we will provide all necessary support to them. And farms can also engage in this activity, and they do. I do not want to make a mistake but I think certain concessions have been provided. For example, up to 20 percent of costs related to this activity are reimbursed. I think this percentage could be increased to at least 30 percent and eventually to 50 percent. We will, of course, expand this initiative across the country. It is something we should address. <…> Vladimir Putin:(commenting on remarks by Yevgeny Guzov, Director for Biotechnological Production at R-Pharm, who spoke about the impact of sanctions on the possibility of obtaining the necessary raw materials, supplies, and equipment for biotechnological production, and asked how the President viewed long-term plans for import substitution, given the existence of sanctions) First, I have said repeatedly, including, if I am not mistaken, during our conversation today, that import substitution is not a panacea. Neither do we seek to substitute one hundred percent of imports. No matter how hard we try, we will be unable to substitute bananas, despite our achievements in plant selection, of which our colleagues have reported today. We can, of course, produce them by using LNG to maintain greenhouses in the required condition. But it cannot be produced commercially, can it? This is why it is necessary to cooperate with all those with whom there is a chance to cooperate, and we will do that. With regard to critically important technologies, however, we should have competences of our own. And we will certainly develop them, including in the areas you have mentioned. But it goes without saying that state support is needed to develop them. Therefore, we will formulate these objectives and render this support. There is no other option we can think of. As for the sphere of activities you have mentioned, I told producers and now I want to tell those engaged in R&D… Incidentally, this is partially an answer to the question about the qualities of a leader. Our inventors and scientists– this has always been the case, by the way, not only in this country but also the world over– those who produced certain medicines, being fanatically devoted to their cause, tested these medications on themselves. And there were even more impressive cases, where people deliberately infected themselves to see how medication worked on this or that disease. It is these people, fanatical devotees to their cause, who achieved qualitative breakthroughs and results and brought about a revolution in their area. Your business is crucially important and we will do our best to support you. Perhaps we will even try to do it more effectively than we have until now. When faced with concrete problems, we will respond to them. Yevgeny Guzov: Thank you, we will go on working. Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much, too. <…> Yevgeny Trofimenko, Umatex R&D Centre, Rosatom State Corporation: Mr President, I have been dealing with composite materials for the past six years. We have a lot of work at the moment. Vladimir Putin: Did you make the MC-21 aircraft's wing? Yevgeny Trofimenko: Yes, we did. Vladimir Putin: Please accept my congratulations, and I sincerely want to thank you. Yevgeny Trofimenko: Thank you. It is very important for us that our work is appreciated and that it benefits the state. But I want to say that the MC-21 wing is already history for us. We have accomplished it. Today, we are working on even better high-quality fibres. Vladimir Putin: History? Do not tell me that this is a vestige of the past. This is an aircraft of the future. Yevgeny Trofimenko: It is a plane of the future, but we are now making even better materials. We have gathered today to discuss the future, rather than current and past developments. This future is causing certain apprehensions because composite materials are a sector closely linked with petrochemistry, and this implies petrochemical synthesis, in the first place. We produce huge amounts of crude oil and natural gas, but, unfortunately, their refining levels remain insufficient. I have listened to our colleagues, and about 80 percent of the speakers use commercial amounts of chemicals or their derivatives, one way or another. We can see the following problem in this connection. What do you think of an initiative calling for state incentives to promote deep oil and gas refining projects? For example, this can be implemented as a certain national project or, to make it even more ambitious, in the form of a major state corporation that would set and address four main tasks that I personally see. The first task is scaling and oil refining depth. Second is expanding the line of products. Third, we must resolve the chemical engineering issue. Fourth comes chemical tool engineering, a highly desirable aspect. This issue will probably become topical now because our Western""friends"" intend to ban oil and gas imports from Russia. Of course, they will kill BASF in a month after imposing this embargo, but it would simply eliminate yet another rival, so to say. I believe that we could reroute at least part of surplus amounts to the domestic market and sell them at a discount. This would make it possible not to fill oil and gas wells with concrete, God forbid, and to provide the entire Russian economy with chemical raw materials. We would therefore resolve a strategic issue. Vladimir Putin: This is the most important area, naturally. Economic conditions are being created where it is increasingly beneficial for us to sell oil products rather than crude oil. Obviously, this is the most promising area for the future pivots. Russia's SIBUR is specialising in this– petrochemistry and gas chemistry. This is why, of course, it is the level of the second, third and subsequent processing stages. The effect includes the development of high technologies, scientific progress, skilled personnel and good salaries, because it costs more and this is the world market. To be sure, we will continue to work further in this area. You have mentioned basic chemicals, but there are also fine chemicals with an entire line of support and a certain strategy into the bargain. Of course, we will do this and support companies engaged in this. As for the refusal to use Russian energy resources[in the West]– this is unlikely during the next few years. And no one knows what could happen in several years. Therefore, no one will pour concrete in the wells, there is no need to do that. What will this lead to? Things will be the way they are now: the amount of oil in the global market declines and the prices go up. That's all. Corporate revenues surge in money terms. Everyone sees and understands this. But the current situation is beside the point. You are absolutely right that the important thing is development. And development results from various processing stages and deep refining. We must form our domestic market– a market for metal products and chemical production you just mentioned. The Government is working on this and, I repeat, an entire support programme is emerging. You have mentioned four or five areas, including equipment, and so on. You know, gradually, as the basic necessity will require, this will be revived or born anew in certain areas. I am saying this with one-hundred-percent certainty. It is great that after solving the problem with MC-21 wing, you came and said: this is our past, and we already have future materials. I would like to tell those who do not know much about the subject that we manufacture the MC-21 medium-haul aircraft. There are plans for it to go into serial production 12 months from now. This very good and modern plane can offer some competition to Boeing airliners. What have our friends and partners done? They have persuaded the Department of State to include carbon fibres for aircraft wing in the list of sanctions. Actually, these products have absolutely nothing to do with the defence industry. Why did they do this? They did this to prevent the Russian aircraft from entering the market and to seize this market niche themselves. They are simply using geopolitical tools in an unscrupulous, unfair and gross competitive struggle. In fact, this is a disgrace, but they are doing this. Although they have done this, the relevant Rosatom subdivision(our colleague is addressing this issue, and he has just discussed the matter) manufactured these materials. To the best of my knowledge, they are even better than foreign alternatives, in many respects. Of course, to develop this area further, we need to pay attention to various aspects that you have just mentioned, including the chemical tool engineering industry and machine-tool building. Of course, we will do all this. I repeat, we have drafted a programme under a strategy for developing the chemical industry. However, we will modify it whenever necessary and in line with practical experience regarding our short-term tasks. We will certainly do this. We will help various companies. All these companies are feeling very confident, they are working effectively and they are developing large-scale projects in the Far East. SIBUR and corresponding subdivisions of Gazprom and Rosatom are working effectively; everyone is working effectively. Yes, there are some shortages, including equipment shortages. This will not stop all these projects. Current logistics problems will not stop these projects. Yevgeny Trofimenko: It appears that the Amur Gas Chemical Complex is a real jewel of the Russian petro-chemical industry, and this is a giant plant. We would like it to be among many other similar plants of the same size and scale that will provide us with the entire range of products, so to say. Instead of one jewel in the crown, we need a necklace with an entire array of jewels. Vladimir Putin: You are right. We will do this gradually. It is common knowledge that walking makes the road. Consequently, we will gradually move on, and we will meet domestic market demand. Russian production facilities have not yet saturated this demand. We will start developing international markets later on, and we are already doing this in some areas. We will certainly do this. We possess competitive advantages because we have the necessary raw materials. Yes, this is the case. Many others lack it, but we have this feedstock. So, we will be working together with you. <…> Gidroservis CEO Igor Sukhov: In fact, I perhaps don't even have anything to ask you. I would like to tell you that you can count on all of us here, all young entrepreneurs, scientists and specialists. And perhaps I will even dare to say that you can rely on the entire community of young and active people not just here but across our enormous country who are ready to work and develop. Vladimir Putin: You said I could count on you. Thank you very much, but it is only natural, because today I am the head of the Russian state. I would like to say that it is not me who should count on you. It is Russia that must count on such young and active, as I said at the beginning of our conversation, nice, ambitious, and future-oriented people. Igor Sukhov: We are ready. Vladimir Putin: This is a challenge, do you understand? In fact, today, when someone jumps off, leaves, or prefers to stop some activity here, they will regret it. It is not a threat. They will not regret it because we are threatening anyone– we simply do not threaten anyone. They will regret it, because Russia is a country with really great opportunities, and many regret that they have to leave. These are all manifestations of the internal state of these countries that cannot make independent decisions: we are returning to where we started. And we are a sovereign country, so we must look to the future, and we are looking to the future. But this future can only be created by people like you. And so, the country is counting on you. Thank you very much. I wish you success."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68586,Meeting with General Director of Rosagroleasing Pavel Kosov,2022-06-08T13:55:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Pavel Kosov reported to the President about the state company's activities and its contribution to the development of the agro-industrial sector in Russia.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Kosov, agricultural leasing has been functioning for 20 years, investing over 400 billion rubles in the agro-industrial sector, with more than one-third of this sum invested during the last four years. You operate in all regions of Russia and you have achieved success. Let us hear about it, one thing at a time. General Director Pavel Kosov: You are quite right. Last year, the company celebrated its 20th anniversary. It has a long and interesting history. I would like to dwell on the company's current role in the development of the agro-industrial sector and on its development prospects. We have prepared a presentation, which I would like to submit, if I may. You have cited absolutely correct figures: the total amount of investment is 400 billion rubles, with the last four years accounting for one-third of this sum. We annually increase the amount of equipment purchased. In fact, this is a balanced strategy that includes both public support, our operations on the foreign currency bond market, and leaseback payments. Our loss-free operations over the last few years have enabled us to invest leasing payments on a grand scale in equipment purchases. We see that we can develop dynamically and we see development prospects. It is quite important to note that the equipment we purchase remains in the fields and continues to work even after the expiry of the leasing contracts. We are expansive in the geographical sense and operate in all regions. Absolutely everyone has equal access to our products and services. A good example of our""salvo"" supplies is the delivery of equipment to the Republic of Crimea exactly two months after that region joined the Russian Federation. It should be said that this is the biggest region, where 50 percent of equipment used in the fields has been purchased through the Rosagroleasing system. We are continuing this work. We have a vast client database with over 15,000 customers. It is very important to note that small and medium-sized companies account for 80 percent of the total number of customers. All of them can buy equipment manufactured at our plants in the Russian Federation. We are doing all this from our office in Moscow, which employs no more than 400 people. We have no regional offices or subsidiaries. All this was made possible by the fact that, over the past few years, we have been actively developing our digital data platform that now also includes a mobile app. Our performance confirms the company's efficiency as a reliable partner during technical and technological modernisation and as a partner of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation. Since 2018, we have expanded our operations three times over, and we have boosted supply volumes from 17 billion rubles to 53 billion rubles. It is very important to note here that, as the slide shows, our programmes have made it possible to eliminate a negative long-term trend that had evolved over the decades, that is, when we scrapped more equipment than was purchased. We can see that, since 2020, equipment procurement volumes have increased appreciably, and we are now scrapping less equipment. We believe that our company has also contributed to this process. Apart from our main efforts to purchase and lease out equipment, we have been implementing major investment projects in the field of import substitution and expanded exports. Our portfolio includes many such projects, and I would like to dwell on two of them. The first project deals with an ice cream plant in Tutayev, in the Yaroslavl Region. It has received investment worth 2.5 billion rubles, and over 1,000 jobs have been created there. The Nadezhdinskoye priority development area(PDA) not far from Vladivostok in the Primorye Territory is our second enterprise manufacturing fodder additives, probiotics and antibiotics for animals. Mr President, you opened this enterprise during the 2021 Far Eastern Economic Forum. Today, the enterprise is working three shifts, 24 hours a day, now that we have stopped importing similar products from European countries, and this is highly appropriate. Generally speaking, it is ready to fully meet the Russian agro-industrial sector's demand for these products. Vladimir Putin: Fine, thank you. <…>"

Today, the social system has many responsible tasks. Homes for veterans and boarding houses, social service organisations and centres for assisting families and children employ various professionals: specialists on social services and rehabilitation, teachers, psychologists, medical workers and lawyers. All of them have one thing in common– mercy, personal involvement and sincere concern for those who simply cannot do without assistance. For many of your wards, you have become truly close people rather than just irreplaceable assistants. It is gratifying that in the past few years, NGOs and volunteers have been befittingly carrying out the noble mission of social patronage along with government institutions.

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68580,Meeting on economic issues,2022-06-07T13:45:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region",The President held a regular meeting on economic issues via videoconference.,"Taking part in the meeting were Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Anton Vaino, First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov, First Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Sergei Kiriyenko, Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin, Presidential Aide Maxim Oreshkin, Minister of Economic Development Maxim Reshetnikov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, and Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina. * * * The President's opening remarks at the meeting on economic issues President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, good afternoon. We continue exchanging information and views on the state of our national economy and drafting decisions for this sector. Today, I suggest that we review trends and developments in the key sectors and the current macroeconomic indicators in general. Of course, we will discuss the effect from the measures that were adopted, as well as additional decisions for supporting household incomes and stimulating business activity. I would like to begin with dynamics in the production sector. Russia's industrial output increased by 3.9 percent in the first four months of 2022. However, there was a slight decline in April, with a substantial contraction in car manufacturing and oil refining. Several sectors, for example, the steel industry, have been warning us about a significant decline in their output volumes in the medium-term. As you know, we have already held several meetings on specific sectors of the economy with representatives of the key businesses and the relevant government agencies. Together, we outlined our priorities and future steps, and agreed on specific measures to support companies, producers and their workforce in the current environment. I would like to point out to our colleagues in the Government that it is essential that these decisions be implemented and help the affected sectors overcome the challenges they face today. These challenges stem from a number of circumstances – let's not dwell too much on this subject now. I will add that it is necessary to step up work in these and some other areas, to meticulously study all the details and make well-considered decisions. In this context, we will certainly continue holding sectoral meetings to stay aware of the problems faced by domestic producers, suppliers and contractors, and, of course, to give timely, targeted and effective responses to the arising challenges. As for positive results, we know well that we have positive dynamics in agriculture and construction. These are vital, backbone branches of our economy, which employ millions of people, millions of specialists. The growth and strengthening of these branches are decisive for developing entire regions and territories of our country, for improving living standards for our people. I will also note low unemployment. In April, it was at the lowest historical level in Russia, and in May, the number of jobless, far from increasing, even decreased a little. In April, it stood at 4 percent, which is the lowest rate on record. In the current conditions, this is a very serious achievement, but I would like to ask you to keep the situation under control, considering that there are still risks in the labour market, of course. Furthermore, we managed to control inflation. In annual terms, it reached 17.4 percent on May 27. Starting in the second half of May, prices stopped rising altogether, and inflation is zero now. But we must bear in mind that there are pluses in this and also a trap, an ambush, as people say. Therefore, it is necessary to analyse the situation very thoroughly and make timely decisions. In effect, this is what we are doing. The situation in the currency market is also stable. The strengthening of the ruble made it possible to relax requirements for exporters. This primarily applies to the reduction of the mandatory sale of currency revenues from 80 to 50 percent. The sale period was extended as well. According to expert estimates and in your opinion, this should make it easier to conduct foreign trade, but I would like to draw your attention to certain risks in this area, too. Also, during our previous meetings, I already mentioned the importance of supporting consumer demand and spurring its dynamics. In May, retail trade in nominal terms was up by 5.4 percent compared to the same period last year. However, adjusted to inflation, it declined in real terms. I would like to re-emphasise the importance of stimulating the end demand in the economy, to ensure the growth of individual incomes, and to provide businesses with additional liquidity and lending resources. A number of decisions to this effect have already been made. On June 1, pensions and the minimum wage, as well as the subsistence wage, were increased by 10 percent, and as a result, many social benefits and payments have increased. Companies in a number of sectors of the economy will be eligible for a deferment in paying insurance premiums for the second quarter of 2022. However, judging by the budget statistics – I discussed this with the Prime Minister not long ago – not all companies took advantage of this opportunity in May. Actually, less than half of that amount was used. We allocated 350 billion, but only 137 billion was used. Let's get to the bottom of this today. In any case, I want the Government, the regions, and our leading business associations to work more closely with the business and to convey in-depth information to the companies on the ground about who is entitled to deferred insurance premiums, how to exercise this right, and so on. I would also like our colleagues from the Government and the Central Bank to pay attention to business lending and mortgage issuance, which are down despite the key rate cut and the recently launched lending-related state support programmes. Let's discuss separately ways to increase the effectiveness of these measures. In closing, work on the federal budget for the next three years is underway. The design of budget rules, which must not only ensure public finance stability, but also bolster the growth rate of the Russian economy, is a matter of fundamental importance. Clearly, flexible approaches and adjustments must be used. I want the Government to submit proposals regarding a new design of the budget rules by late July. Let's move on to reviewing the issues at hand. There is plenty to discuss, which we have been planning to do for a long time now. Mr Reshetnikov, please go ahead. <…>"

I sincerely congratulate the Forum organizers and all those who have taken and are taking part in its work on this significant anniversary. Over the years, the Forum has become a highly respected and representative international event. Its participants, which include Russian and foreign politicians, scientists and entrepreneurs, focus on a variety of topics concerning the domestic and world economy: from specific areas of industrial cooperation to information security and environmental protection. Mutually beneficial long-term contracts are signed and business experience is exchanged in the course of direct and constructive communication. The Forum's anniversary is taking place at a difficult time for the entire international community. The mistakes of Western countries in economic policy over many years and illegitimate sanctions have led to a wave of global inflation, the disruption of usual supply chains, and a sharp increase in poverty and food shortages. Yet, as can be the case, along with these challenges, new prospects are emerging. This is why the Forum's slogan– New Opportunities in a New World– seems so relevant. I am confident that for Russia the 2020s will become a period when the country strengthens its economic sovereignty, which involves the accelerated development of its infrastructure and technological base, qualitative upgrades in the level of training for specialists, as well as the establishment of an independent and efficient financial system. In addition, the Russian economy will increasingly rely on private initiatives and, of course, will remain committed to transparency and broad international cooperation. It is in our common interests to bolster trade and investment, encourage the joint development of technologies, strengthen financial and stock markets, and increase the share of settlements in national currencies. It is crucial to introduce and develop truly mutually beneficial integration models, as is already being done in the Eurasian Economic Union. I strongly believe that the Forum will continue to make a significant contribution to solving numerous high-priority challenges facing humanity, while mutual trust, meaningfulness and commitment to fruitful dialogue and partnership will invariably remain its distinguishing features."""
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68576,Meeting with Human Rights Commissioner Tatyana Moskalkova,2022-06-06T11:00:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow","Human Rights Commissioner Tatyana Moskalkova presented her annual performance report to the President and told him about the work to bring Russian military personnel back from captivity and to ensure the rights of the citizens who have arrived from the DPR, LPR and Ukraine.","President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon. I have your album. Let's talk about the work carried out by the Human Rights Commissioner in 2021. Human Rights Commissioner Tatyana Moskalkova Moskalkova TatyanaHuman Rights Commissioner in Russian Federation: Mr President, in accordance with the federal constitutional law, I would like to present my 2021 performance report. It is long this year. Let me report on the main results, in the context of the current situation. Last year, amid the pandemic and restrictive sanctions, my task was to continue providing people with the opportunity to address the Human Rights Commissioner to share their pain, grief or to receive a consultation and also to make it easier. People never come to us just to talk. It was crucially important to find new tools. And we did find them: we opened a round-the-clock hotline, set up a group that deals promptly with enquiries, created an online office and used the remote format. All of that is useful today when we have over 1.4 million refugees in the country, when the special military operation is underway in Ukraine, when we witness unprecedented sanctions and Russophobia. Naturally, it has resulted in many new tasks and I think we are managing them well. Last year, we received an unprecedented number of applications, 59,500. Neither I nor my predecessors have ever received that many before. It was very important to review every one of them and find out the truth and help people, if possible. With 2,253 appeals, violations of the rights of citizens were confirmed, and the rights of 11,000 people were restored. The rights of even more people were ensured because one appeal is usually submitted by residents of an entire block of flats, a company's staff or even a residential area when it comes to the environment. As a result of the measures taken, the rights of 875 suspects, accused and convicted persons were restored. Most of them complained about long periods of pre-investigation review, preliminary investigation, refusals to initiate a criminal case, refusals to gather evidence not only to prove guilt, but also to prove innocence. Over 390 accused and convicted persons received an opportunity to restore their rights with our assistance, mostly on medical issues, abolition of illegal decisions related to denials of parole, or application of illegal measures and methods. We know that criminal cases have been initiated regarding the Saratov correctional labour facility and in Irkutsk. We have also asked internal monitoring and supervision agencies about this. Over this time, we have managed to help a significant number of people in connection with labour issues; they have been paid wages that were sometimes not paid during the pandemic due to the fact that enterprises went bankrupt. It is very important that the state take additional measures in order to protect people in the sphere of labour relations. We have helped 1,500 workers with getting their wage arrears amounting to 39 million rubles settled. About 5,000 were given the opportunity to receive social payments to purchase housing or build a house, and 4,200 people living in the territory of Baikonur have had the chance to purchase housing in Russia and return to their homeland after you issued the Executive Order(I asked you about this last year). I would like to use this occasion to convey words of gratitude from these citizens– they asked me to do this– for the fact that they have received help thanks to your Executive Order. Another 227 have been given the opportunity to restore their rights in the social sphere. Here you can see the details on our topics and our achievements, as well as problems that have been identified. The Institute of the Commissioner for Human Rights was involved in the release of Konstantin Yaroshenko and Oleg Nikitin from prisons in the US. I would also like to thank you for fighting for the return of these citizens. Together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and special services, we addressed both the relevant US departments and many international organisations. We are very glad that this happened. Restoring the rights of these people would be completely impossible without the cooperation and principled position of the Supreme Court, the Prosecutor General's Office, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, governors, your plenipotentiaries and, of course, civil society institutions with which we continue to work and strengthen our relationship. Now we are working closely with the Defence Ministry and Emergencies Ministry on appeals from citizens related to the special military operation in Ukraine and with refugees staying on our territory. Since February 24, we have received over 3,000 appeals in defence of the rights and legitimate interests of citizens, persons and military personnel, violated by the Ukrainian authorities. Thanks to the Defence Ministry, measures have been taken to restore violated rights. I cannot but take this opportunity to say that it is a matter of great concern that the International Committee of the Red Cross has not yet informed us about visiting our Russian prisoners of war. We do not have any information on how the control over compliance with international norms and rules is being carried out in relation to our service personnel who find themselves in this situation. As for me, I visited Ukrainian prisoners in Sevastopol and made sure that their rights were fully respected in accordance with international norms and principles. All their humanitarian needs, including bed clothes, food and medical care, are met. I personally received citizens there. After that, at their request, I informed their relatives about their fate, what they asked for. It is very important to ensure the work of the humanitarian component through our commissioners for human rights. At the start of the special military operation, many civilians who were in Ukraine were sort of taken hostage, and they were prevented from returning to their homeland. We have been approached by a huge number of truck drivers, sailors, people who were engaged in labour relations. To date, as a result of the dialogue we are conducting with the Ukrainian side, 45 truck drivers, 36 sailors, crew members of four ships and employees of Rosatom have been returned, and it is very important that this situation is resolved. We are also working with the evacuees in temporary accommodation centres. Like all our human rights commissioners in the Russian regions, we go out to these people every day to see how we can help. And there are many people who need help. Vladimir Putin: You mean refugees, don't you? Tatyana Moskalkova: Yes, of course. For some reason, people who have been evacuated do not like to be called refugees, as a rule, they get temporary asylum status, not refugee status. This gives them an opportunity to find employment. This is one of the priorities in working with these people now. But taking this opportunity, Mr President, thank you very much from these people for ensuring their safety, for providing everything they need to keep them alive.

They are well aware that human impact on the environment must be reasonable and caring. Let me stress that issues of rational natural resource management and ensuring environmental safety are among the key national priorities. The preservation of the ecosystem biodiversity and the health and quality of life of millions of people largely depend on their successful resolution. Today, we are facing major challenges that reflect our times, which target the formation of an effective system of countering wildfires and floods, broad introduction of advanced resource-saving technologies in industry, and creating an environmental culture in society. I am pleased to note that certain results have already been attained: the number of environmental projects is growing with each year while the circle of their participants is expanding, more territories are granted the status of specially protected areas. We are determined to continue contributing to resolving issues connected with improving the environment and preventing global climate change."""

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68571,Interview with Rossiya TV,2022-06-03T20:00:00Z,Sochi,The President answered questions from Pavel Zarubin of Rossyia 1 TV channel. ,"Pavel Zarubin: Mr President, we have just followed your meeting with the head of Senegal who is also the current leader of the African Union. He expressed, and actually in the past week many countries have expressed concern not so much about the food crisis, but they are afraid of large-scale famine because world food prices are climbing and so are oil and gas prices, These issues are interrelated. Naturally, the West blames Russia for this, too. What is the real situation at this point, how is it developing? And what do you think will happen in the food and energy markets? President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Yes, indeed, we are seeing attempts to place the responsibility on Russia for developments in the global food market and the growing problems there. I must say that this is another attempt to pin the blame on someone else. But why? First, the situation with the global food market did not become worse yesterday or even with the launch of Russia's special military operation in Donbass, in Ukraine. The situation took a downturn in February 2020 during the efforts to counter the coronavirus pandemic when the global economy was down and had to be revived. The financial and economic authorities in the United States, of all things, found nothing better than to allocate large amounts of money to support the population and certain businesses and economic sectors. We generally did almost the same thing, but I assure you that we were much more accurate, and the results are obvious: we did this selectively and got the desired results without affecting macroeconomic indicators, including excessive inflation growth. The situation was quite different in the United States. The money supply in the United States grew by 5.9 trillion in less than two years, from February 2020 to the end of 2021– unprecedented productivity of the money printing machines. The total cash supply grew by 38.6 percent. Apparently, the US financial authorities believed the dollar was a global currency, and it would spread, as usual, as it did in previous years, would dissolve in the global economy, and the United States would not even feel it. But that did not happen, not this time. As a matter of fact, decent people– and there are such people in the United States– the Secretary of the Treasury recently said they had made a mistake. So, it was a mistake made by the US financial and economic authorities– it has nothing to do with Russia's actions in Ukraine, it is totally unrelated. And that was the first step– and a big one– towards the current unfavourable food market situation, because, in the first place, food prices immediately went up, they grew. This is the first reason. The second reason was European countries' short-sighted policies, and above all, the European Commission's policy in regard to energy. We see what is going on there. Personally, I believe that many political players in the United States and Europe have been taking advantage of people's natural concerns about the climate, climate change, and they began to promote this green agenda, including in the energy sector. It all seems fine, except for the unqualified and groundless recommendations about what needs to be done in the energy sector. The capabilities of alternative types of energy are overestimated: solar, wind, any other types, hydrogen power– those are good prospects for the future, probably, but today, they cannot be produced in the required amount, with the required quality and at acceptable prices. And at the same time, they began to belittle the importance of conventional types of energy, including, and above all, hydrocarbons. What was the result of this? Banks stopped issuing loans because they were under pressure. Insurance companies stopped insuring deals. Local authorities stopped allocating plots of land for expanding production and reduced the construction of special transport, including pipelines. All this led to a shortage of investment in the world energy sector and price hikes as a result. The wind was not as strong as expected during the past year, winter dragged on, and prices instantly soared. On top of all that, the Europeans did not listen to our persistent requests to preserve long-term contracts for the delivery of natural gas to European countries. They started to wind them down. Many are still valid, but they started winding them down. This had a negative effect on the European energy market: the prices went up. Russia has absolutely nothing to do with this. But as soon as gas prices started going up, fertiliser prices followed suit because gas is used to produce some of these fertilisers. Everything is interconnected. As soon as fertiliser prices started growing, many businesses, including those in European countries, became unprofitable and started shutting down altogether. The amount of fertiliser in the world market took a dive, and prices soared dramatically, much to the surprise of many European politicians. However, we warned them about this, and this is not linked to Russia's military operation in Donbass in any way. This has nothing to do with it. But when we launched our operation, our so-called European and American partners started taking steps that aggravated the situation in both the food sector and fertiliser production. By the way, Russia accounts for 25 percent of the world fertiliser market. As for potash fertilisers, Alexander Lukashenko told me this– but we should double-check it, of course, although I think it is true– when it comes to potash fertilisers, Russia and Belarus account for 45 percent of the world market. This is a tremendous amount. The crop yield depends on the quantity of fertiliser put into the soil. As soon as it became clear that our fertilisers would not be in the world market, prices instantly soared on both fertilisers and food products because if there are no fertilisers, it is impossible to produce the required amount of agricultural products. One thing leads to another, and Russia has nothing to do with it. Our partners made a host of mistakes themselves, and now they are looking for someone to blame. Of course, Russia is the most suitable candidate in this respect. Pavel Zarubin: Incidentally, it has just been reported that the wife of the head of our largest fertiliser companies has been included in the new European package of sanctions. What will all this lead to in your opinion? Vladimir Putin: This will make a bad situation worse. The British and later the Americans– Anglo-Saxons– imposed sanctions on our fertilisers. Then, having realised what was happening, the Americans lifted their sanctions, but the Europeans did not. They are telling me themselves during contacts: yes, we must think about it, we must do something about it, but today they have just aggravated this situation. This will make the situation in the world fertiliser market worse, and hence the crop prospects will be much more modest, and prices will keep going up– that is it. This is an absolutely myopic, erroneous, I would say, simply stupid policy that leads to a deadlock. Pavel Zarubin: But Russia is accused by high-ranking officials of preventing the grain that is actually there, in Ukrainian ports, from leaving. Vladimir Putin: They are bluffing, and I will explain why. First, there are some objective things, and I will mention them now. The world produces about 800 million tonnes of grain, wheat per year. Now we are being told that Ukraine is ready to export 20 million tonnes. So, 20 million tonnes out of 800 million tonnes amounts to 2.5 percent. But if we proceed from the fact that wheat accounts for merely 20 percent of all food products in the world– and this is the case, this is not our data, it comes from the UN– this means that these 20 million tonnes of Ukrainian wheat are just 0.5 percent, practically nothing. This is the first point. The second. 20 million tonnes of Ukrainian wheat are potential exports. Today, the US official bodies also say that Ukraine could export six million tonnes of wheat. According to our Ministry of Agriculture, the figure is not six but about five million tonnes, but okay, let us assume it is six, plus it could export seven million tonnes of maize– this is the figure of our Ministry of Agriculture. We realise that this is not much. In the current agricultural year of 2021–2022, we will export 37 million and, I believe, we will raise these exports to 50 million tonnes in 2022–2023. But this is apropos, by the way. As for shipping out Ukrainian grain, we are not preventing this. There are several ways to export grain. The first one. You can ship it out via the Ukraine-controlled ports, primarily in the Black Sea– Odessa and nearby ports. We did not mine the approaches to the port– Ukraine did this. I have already said to all our colleagues many times– let them demine the ports and let the vessels loaded with grain leave. We will guarantee their peaceful passage to international waters without any problems. There are no problems at all. Go ahead. They must clear the mines and raise the ships they sunk on purpose in the Black Sea to make it difficult to enter the ports to the south of Ukraine. We are ready to do this; we will not use the demining process to initiate an attack from the sea. I have already said this. This is the first point. The second. There is another opportunity: the ports in the Sea of Azov– Berdyansk and Mariupol– are under our control, and we are ready to ensure a problem-free exit from these ports, including for exported Ukrainian grain. Go ahead, please. We are already working on the demining process. We are completing this work– at one time, Ukrainian troops laid three layers of mines. This process is coming to an end. We will create the necessary logistics. This is not a problem; we will do this. This is the second point. The third. It is possible to move grain from Ukraine via the Danube and through Romania. Fourth. It is also possible through Hungary. And fifth, it is also possible to do this via Poland. Yes, there are some technical problems because the tracks are of different gauges and the wheel bogies must be changed. But this only takes a few hours, that is all. Finally, the easiest way is to transport grain via Belarus. This is the easiest and the cheapest way because from there it can be instantly shipped to the Baltic ports and further on to any place in the world. But they would have to lift the sanctions from Belarus. This is not our problem though. At any rate, President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko puts it like this: if someone wants to resolve the problem of exporting Ukrainian grain, if this problem exists at all, please use the simplest way– through Belarus. No one will stop you. So, the problem of shipping grain out of Ukraine does not really exist. Pavel Zarubin: How would the logistics work to ship it from the ports under our control? What would the conditions be? Vladimir Putin: No conditions. They are welcome. We will provide peaceful passage, guarantee safe approaches to these ports, and ensure the safe entry of foreign ships and passage through the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea in any direction. By the way, several ships are stuck in Ukrainian ports at this point. These are foreign ships, dozens of them. They are simply locked up and their crews are still being held hostage."

I know that you have an eventful programme of your stay in our country. To begin the meeting, I would like to note that we remember and pay attention to the landmark events: just a week ago, we celebrated Africa Day. We also marked the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations with Senegal. Soon, within a few days, you will also mark the creation of the African Union. In this regard, I would like to note that our country has always been on Africa's side and has always supported Africa in its fight against colonialism. I am glad to note that the Russia-Africa summit was held here in Sochi in 2019. We have entered a new stage of development and we place a great emphasis on our relations with African countries. This has had a certain positive result. Our trade is growing. In the first months of this year it grew by 34 percent. We are striving to develop cultural ties with African countries and will do everything we can to promote this process. Here in Russia people have always been interested in African culture, and it is a big part of our interaction. Africa's role on the international stage and in the political area in general is growing. We believe that Africa as a whole and its countries, with which we traditionally share friendly relations, have huge potential, and we are going to continue to develop our relations with Africa in general and with its states. I am happy to see you. Welcome. Chairperson of the African Union and President of Senegal Macky Sall(retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President. It is a pleasure to see you here, to meet with you in Sochi, this wonderful Black Sea city. I am particularly glad to see you against this international background. I was grateful for your call, which gave us the chance to talk at the very beginning of the crisis, and I would like to thank you for receiving us here today– I say this not only as the President of Senegal but also as the Chairperson of the African Union. The Chairperson of the African Union Commission accompanies me today. Indeed, Russia played a tremendous role in the independence of the African continent and this will never be forgotten by the African continent. I am here in the name of this friendship, among other things. We are pinning great hopes on our cooperation, including bilateral Russian-African cooperation, but we are here today also to talk about the crisis and its consequences. As you know, a number of countries voted for resolutions at the United Nations. The position of Africa is very heterogeneous but despite heavy pressure, many countries still did not denounce Russia's position. It is also possible to look at Asia, the Middle East and Latin America– we see that the world is closely following the developments. I do have great hopes and I have arrived today to say that the countries that are so far away from the hotbed of the conflict are still experiencing its consequences. Anti-Russia sanctions have made this situation worse and now we do not have access to grain from Russia, primarily to wheat. And, most importantly, we do not have access to fertiliser. The situation was bad and now it has become worse, creating a threat to food security in Africa. This morning, I spoke with my colleague from the African Union Commission. I told him that there were two major problems– the crisis and the sanctions. We must work together to resolve these problems so that sanctions are lifted on food products, in particular, grain, and fertiliser. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68558,Meeting on developing road construction,2022-06-02T16:45:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region",The President of Russia held a videoconference meeting on road construction.,"The meeting was attended by Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Anton Vaino, First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov, Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin, presidential aides Igor Levitin and Maxim Oreshkin, Minister of Economic Development Maxim Reshetnikov, Minister of Transport Vitaly Savelyev, Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov, Minister of Construction, Housing and Utilities Irek Fayzullin, Minister of Science and Higher Education Valery Falkov, Head of the Republic of Buryatia – Chairman of the State Council Commission on Transport Alexei Tsydenov, Head of the Federal Road Agency Roman Novikov, Chairman of the Board of the Russian Highways (Avtodor) State Company Vyacheslav Petushenko, and the leadership of relevant universities – Moscow State University of Civil Engineering (MGSU)and Moscow Automobile and Road Construction State Technical University (MADI). * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues, We are continuing a series of meetings on key areas of economic development. Naturally, a special role in this respect belongs to transport, logistics and infrastructure. I will remind you that we have already discussed support for the aviation industry and analysed the implementation of port and railway projects, as well as the upgrading of checkpoints in the south of the country, in the Azov and Black Sea basin and the Caspian Sea. Today, I suggest discussing in detail measures that are needed to strengthen our road network, to increase the scale and quality of road construction. The importance of this work is obvious. New roads and more convenient logistics create new opportunities for businesses, for strengthening ties between regions and boosting exports. All this together creates a solid foundation for economic growth and the successful resolution of social problems and increases the development rates of the entire country. In the past few years, Russia has launched and implemented large-scale road construction projects. Federal routes with improved passenger and freight traffic conditions are already operating. I mean such rotes as the Neva, Don, Tavrida, the Central Ring Road and others. Construction of the M-12 Moscow-Kazan highway is the most ambitious road construction project today. This route is to link up with Kazakhstan, as part of the Europe-West China corridor. Just as we agreed, the road's eastern section will extend towards Yekaterinburg, Tyumen and Chelyabinsk. Today, I would like to ask you to report on the progress of this work and on subsequent long-term plans. I am talking about access to Siberian regions. I would also like to note that, apart from building motorways with modern and high-quality surfaces, it is necessary to set up the related infrastructure, to open petrol stations, motels and leisure areas, to install communications towers, and to create areas for motorway service facilities where small businesses can launch operations. In short, drivers must find it really convenient and comfortable to use high-speed routes and other roads. On the whole, I would like to note that, in the current conditions, we need to expand and expedite infrastructure construction projects. Instead of simply conducting all planned works on time, we must try and implement them ahead of schedule, and we have to open new road sections more quickly. Apart from ambitious mega-projects, we must focus on regional transport systems and the so-called basic road network. Yesterday evening, we discussed this matter with Mr Khusnullin, ahead of our today's meeting. People use these roads daily, and, of course, their condition, safety and quality must meet the drivers' needs. I would like to note that the total volume of works in the regions is in no way inferior to federal highway construction and repair projects, and it even surpasses them. We have set the national goal of boosting the share of high-quality road networks to at least 85 percent of all roads in major urban areas in 2030. It is important that these works are now proceeding ahead of schedule. I believe that, considering the current rapid pace of road construction and tasks regarding the well-balanced development of the country's entire territory, we can and must set an even more ambitious goal. Instead of implementing targeted road improvement projects in major cities and urban areas, we need to organise this work everywhere. In the next five years, we need to bring up to standard at least 85 percent of all main roads nationwide. We have the resources and capabilities to do so. For this reason, it is essential that efforts to develop logistics corridors, including international routes, go hand in hand with road construction and repairs. As I have already said, last week we had a meeting on southern transport corridors. Moving forward, we will discuss in detail the eastern corridors, including road construction in the Far East. Today, I suggest we discuss specific proposals put forward by the Government regarding its long-term plans for roads. Let me note that adopting a long-term approach to setting objectives for this sector and delivering on them can be beneficial in several ways. We all know this very well and have discussed this many times. Still, I would like to once again explain what I mean. First, contractors receive long-term orders, which enable them to better plan their operations and therefore reduce costs. Anyway, I hope this is the way it happens. Second, this ensures that our manufacturers have a guaranteed market for their equipment and construction materials, also over the long run. This offers them an opportunity to invest in new production capacity while also expanding and upgrading their product lines and creating new jobs. Third, stepping up road construction helps promote research and development in Russia on road design, construction management and manufacturing of construction materials. Russia has its own experience in infrastructure construction. Again, we have everything to work at the highest level in keeping with all the environmental standards and complying with the latest requirements in terms of road quality and durability, as well as road safety. It is also worth noting that our specialised universities and research institutes must proactively contribute to developing new materials and technological solutions, as well as training professionals for the road construction sector. We need to pay special attention to training blue-collar workers. Many construction projects struggle to recruit the workers they need, which means that we need to further expand training programmes offered by technical schools and vocational education institutions, retraining centres and centres of excellence. Overall, there are many current tasks to work on right now, and we have a lot of work in front us. I suggest that we discuss all these matters today. Mr Khusnullin, go ahead please. <…> Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, Thank you for the substantive discussion on the agenda and for your opinions. I would like to ask my colleagues from the Presidential Executive Office to take account of these proposals in a document on the results of our meeting. For my part, I will instruct the Government to approve a road construction plan for the next five years, that is, 2023–2027. It should clearly list the facilities to be built, rebuilt or repaired. In addition, it is necessary to compile a list of ""reserve"" facilities. The situation is changing rapidly and we are seeing new opportunities, including financial ones. If budget and other resources come up, we will be able to start funding and implementing these ""reserve"" projects that are waiting their turn. At this point, I would like to address the regional governors separately. We are strictly monitoring the targeted spending of the resources from the Federal Road Fund. In the meantime, regional funding resources are sometimes ""switched"" to other areas. Please stop this practice and use regional road funds strictly for the intended purpose. Furthermore, I would like to ask you to pay special attention to providing materials and equipment for our road construction plans. I would like to emphasise again that the bottom line here is to use Russian products that meet the highest quality standards. In this context, it is important to encourage the developments of domestic research institutions and related universities, grant them broad opportunities for developing and introducing new technology, materials and construction designs, and to remove all administrative and other barriers. Naturally, projects on creating related industrial capacity must be synchronised with road construction work to prevent delays in delivering supplies and implementing the work schedule on time. I am confident that in using this approach we will achieve truly comprehensive results. On one hand, we will ensure the development of the transport infrastructure and give an impetus to the economy, regions and the entire country. On the other hand, we will build up Russia's scientific and technological potential and establish a new production base with modern, well-paid jobs. I would like to once again thank everyone in this meeting."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68550,Meeting with Head of the Circle of Kindness Foundation Archpriest Alexander Tkachenko,2022-06-01T16:45:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region","Vladimir Putin had a meeting, via videoconference, with Archpriest Alexander Tkachenko, head of the Circle of Kindness Foundation for supporting children with serious illnesses. The discussion focused on the results of the charity organisation's first year of work and its future development.","President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Father Alexander. Archpriest Alexander Tkachenko: Hello, Mr President. Vladimir Putin: Hello. The Foundation was created more than a year ago on January 5, 2021, by Presidential Executive Order#16. It is supported by the funds consolidated in the federal budget, namely, an elevated personal income tax on individuals with annual incomes in excess of 5 million rubles. I am aware that the Foundation is operating steadily with even more funds than expected, 82 billion, in its accounts, so it is properly funded. I am aware that you have questions about its future work, and you compiled a report covering the past year. Please go ahead, I am listening. I think much has been accomplished, and the work is being carried out effectively. I am also aware that you have questions concerning the further improvement of this highly noble cause designed to help children with severe, life-threatening chronic diseases, including rare ones, and this is much-needed work. You have been engaged in this work for a long time now. I am aware that you started out with a children's hospice in St Petersburg. The Circle of Kindness' activities must be planned so that it can accomplish all the tasks at hand. Please go ahead, Father Alexander. I am listening to you. Alexander Tkachenko: Thank you very much. I would like to begin by thanking you for creating our country's kindest foundation, which has become a true miracle for many people. You have on your desk an album with photographs of children– a very small number of them– who received help from the Foundation. There are more than 3,000 such children. The Foundation receives very touching messages and videos from the parents, in which they thank the Foundation for giving hope to their children– they now have a hope for the future, have proper childhood and can go back to their everyday routine of playing and studying. The Foundation has embodied society's ideas about justice. All sums received from the increased tax rate go to the Foundation. All citizens of Russia, regardless of their place of residence or social status of their family, can have access to the latest medications. I will tell you about this, if I may. These unique medications bring children back to life. Spinal muscular atrophy was the first illness under review. Now children have access to all three medications. It takes the foundation all but 10 days to arrange for the most expensive injection that is prescribed for all children who have been just diagnosed with this illness. It saves their lives. The introduction of neonatal screening will reveal many ill children, and the Foundation will save their lives. This is why the Foundation is unique. The Foundation has medications that restore the eyesight of children with a form of retinal degeneration. There are medications that allow children with a cartilage development disorder to grow to the average height. This is vital for a child's dignity and future. The main point is that assistance is guaranteed. Before parents had to look for this aid and even appeal to courts, whereas now the Foundation buys medications for a year ahead and even for the first quarter of the next year to ensure continuity. The Foundation has started supplying medications to Russian citizens living in the Donetsk People's Republic. This is also very important. Cooperation with NGOs allows us to plan joint actions and find patients that regional healthcare systems fail to see for some reason. In turn, the Foundation conducts seminars and lectures for doctors. I am trying to describe the Foundation's major activities with these short facts. In reality, the Foundation has turned into a real miracle, and if it were not for it, it is difficult even to imagine what life would be like for many families. As for the Foundation's development, you instructed us to analyse the possibility of providing medications to children after they reach the age of 18. The Foundation's reserves make it possible to raise this age. If you support us, the Foundation will draft amendments to legal regulations, and we will be able to provide children with medications up to the end of the calendar year or even longer. This will allow the regions to change their budgets accordingly and ensure continuity. Many people are waiting for this decision. Vladimir Putin: Let's do as you suggest. How much did you plan? 60 billion rubles? And in reality you have 80 billion, right? Alexander Tkachenko: Eighty. Taking into account the money saved from the past year, the budget amounts to 122 billion. Vladimir Putin: Yes, let's do it. Alexander Tkachenko: There will be just 70–100 children a year in this category. It is very important to ensure that medical treatment is not interrupted. Otherwise, all results will be lost. Vladimir Putin: I understand. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68548,Meeting with families awarded the Order of Parental Glory,2022-06-01T15:40:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region","On International Children's Day, Vladimir Putin had a videoconference meeting with families awarded the Order of Parental Glory.","Taking part in the videoconference meeting with the President were large families from the Voronezh Region, Murmansk, Yalta, Beslan, Saransk, Nizhnevartovsk, Norilsk and Yakutsk. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends, First of all, I would like to congratulate you and all citizens of our country on International Children's Day. I would like to give special greetings to the large and close-knit families who are taking part in our meeting today. I am confident that children are proud that their fathers and mothers have been awarded one of the most important and honorary state decorations in Russia, the Order of Parental Glory. Your relatives and friends feel proud of you as well. Our society highly and wholeheartedly respects the couples that have chosen the difficult but wonderful path of having a large family. This attitude is part of our national character. It is rooted in our thousand-year-long history. Families with only one or two children were an exception in Russia in the past, when most families had three, four or five children. It is gratifying that the tradition of having large families is reviving today, gradually and one step at a time, and increasingly more people are becoming aware of the high moral and spiritual value of family ties and the continuity of generations, and of merits that look simple and understandable yet are extremely important to everyone, namely respect for our elders and care for children, mutual support and the joy of communication. I would like to point out that these are the fundamental values of all the traditional religions in Russia. Those who were born into and grew up in large families with their brothers and sisters feel and know this from childhood. Spiritual generosity and diligence, open-heartedness and responsibility become their main features and determine their decisions and actions when they become adults and independent people. You can usually rely on those who grew up in a large family. They will not betray their friends, colleagues or homeland. This is why large families are respected so much in our society, and this is why the state is giving priority support to them, creating conditions where parents and grandparents, tutors or foster parents can take proper care of the rising generation and help children acquire knowledge, nurture their talents, believe in themselves, think big and grow up to be well-educated and upright people, worthy citizens of Russia. We spoke about the need to enhance the wellbeing and living standards of large families at the recent State Council Presidium meeting. Maybe you have noticed this. We then discussed support measures for families with many children. For example, the programme providing subsidised family mortgages for large families will be extended until at least December 31, 2023. This is a programme for these families, and that includes your families. In general, we agreed to seriously upgrade and expand the provisions of the Presidential Executive Order On Measures of Social Support for Large Families. We also agreed to restore – I want to specifically note this – the Mother Heroine honorary title, which existed in Soviet times. Here is what I would like to suggest. We have just discussed this issue with our colleagues in the Government and the Executive Office. Previously, awarding the Order of Parental Glory medal did not involve a financial bonus. I am referring specifically to the medal of the order. I suggest introducing a lump sum payment as a bonus. There was a lump sum payment of 100,000 rubles for the order but nothing for the medal. I suggest a lump sum payment of 200,000 rubles for the medal. With the Order of Parental Glory, I suggest awarding a lump sum payment of 500,000 rubles with it instead of the previous 100,000 rubles. As for the mothers that are awarded the Mother Heroine title, I suggest that they receive a lump sum payment of one million rubles. I will repeat that supporting families with children and protecting motherhood and childhood are an absolute priority for us and not only at state level. We do not, we should not have children that are not ours. Special care and attention to their needs is part of our cultural and moral values. Today, on International Children's Day we cannot but recall the children of Donbass, of course. They were subjected to mortal danger for eight years. The younger children have never experienced life without bombing and shelling. Many were wounded and many, to our great regret, perished in the war unleashed by the Kiev regime against Donbass. Many children lost their parents and there are some who have been left without any relatives at all. We will do all we can to provide them with every kind of social support, such as medical aid, a good education and an interesting in-demand profession. Naturally, we will help children who have lost their families to acquire loving, friendly and generous families like yours. Using this opportunity, I would like to hear from you, friends, what measures on the part of the state, regions and local authorities are most important for supporting large families. What concrete additional assistance you specifically or parents of many children from among your relatives, friends or neighbours need. I would like to sincerely congratulate you on the well-deserved decorations and wish you all the best in life. But first, I would like to congratulate the Novikovs family on their daughter's birthday – Anastasia is 16 today. Nastya, I wish you success in all of your undertakings, good health and all the best. I am pleased to give the floor to Maria Lvova-Belova. Ms Lvova-Belova, go ahead please. <…> Vladimir Putin: Many thanks to everyone. You know, this is not the first time I hear: ""We are fine, we are content with everything."" The thing is that government officials cannot be content with themselves because we are obviously indebted to you, to such families as yours. It is necessary to enhance support for large families and for motherhood and childhood in general. But if you have paid attention, we are trying to do this year in and year out and are consistently developing support measures on behalf of the state. I would like to thank you for the kind words you said to my colleagues and me. Indeed, the country has many problems, but there are always many problems and in this sense, nothing unusual is happening here. That said, what we are seeing in the area related to ensuring national security and support of our people in Donbass is, of course, an extraordinary situation. Nonetheless, some fundamentals are transient, and some things require our permanent attention no matter what. One of the latter is support for motherhood and childhood. It is in this area that the state is concentrating certain administrative and financial efforts. I can assure you that this is how it is going to be in the future. I would like to offer my best wishes to you on this holiday – Children's Day – and to congratulate all the participants in our current meeting on their state decorations. Thank you and all the best to you! Be happy!"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68541,Address to participants of Bolshaya Peremena festival,2022-06-01T13:05:00Z,NA,Vladimir Putin extended greetings in a video address to the participants of Bolshaya Peremena festival.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, I am sincerely delighted to welcome all the participants in the Bolshaya Peremena festival. And before I say anything else, I would certainly like to congratulate you all– schoolchildren, parents and teachers– on International Children's Day. I know that today, Moscow's VDNKh exhibition grounds is for the first time hosting a gathering that has brought together members of over 300 children's and youth movements, projects, volunteer associations, including national– such as the Bolshaya Peremena community, the Russian Schoolchildren Movement, and the Young Army– and regional and local ones from different cities and regions, as well as from the Lugansk and Donetsk people's republics. You are so different, but you all strive to show your best sides; young as you are, you are trying to tangibly benefit our country, your Motherland. And it's a good thing that thanks to this festival, you can get to know each other, to see how much you have in common, and to learn something new. Bolshaya Peremena is not just a fun and festive event– it provides a space for you to figure out and fully reveal your talents and abilities, choose your future profession, get support for any creative, environmental, volunteer, scientific or entrepreneurial ideas of your own. Increasingly, it is you, schoolchildren, young people who become co-sponsors and initiators of projects that unite your peers. I would like to say that I support your initiative to establish a joint children's movement. Its main purpose is to create an equal, accessible and entertaining environment for development and self-realisation in a variety of areas, but how this will be achieved is up to you. Your opinion, your suggestions are of key importance here. You happen to be living and growing up in a very dynamic time, when the world is changing, and changing rapidly. I am sure that Russia will, if anything, enhance its strength, independence and sovereignty in this complex world, and this work is broader than any particular area. It should span the economy, technology, science and many other areas, including civil society and patriotic education. I believe a strong civil society and the patriotic activity of young people are of the essence. And a lot really depends on you– on your being dedicated and proactive. As you know, a country's success comprises the work and achievements of people united by common values, culture, traditions, and respect for history. It is about people who strive to contribute to Russia's development, people who want their deeds– not words– to determine what is happening in their city, village and country. I have no doubt that you are just that. You, your generation, have everything you need to build a future worth living together: you have dedication, responsibility, love for your Motherland, and willingness to keep learning and help others. I believe in you and believe that you will definitely make all your dreams come true. And once again, happy International Children's Day. Good luck with everything, and all the best."

It has a direct effect on the situation in the industry, high technology, agriculture, medicine, education and ecology and largely determines the quality of people's lives. Amid the current unprecedented external pressure on Russia, the role of strong scientific schools and fundamental high-tech research is growing exponentially and is helping to strengthen our country's sovereignty. The state will continue working consistently to support daring scientific initiatives and promising young researchers, to improve the financial and technical foundation and infrastructure of research. I would like to note that we launched the Decade of Science and Technology this year with a view to attaining these goals. I am confident that your forum will be held in a creative and constructive atmosphere and that its results will boost the development of our school of thought, intellectual, technological, engineering and technical potential."""

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68536,Working meeting with Head of Buryatia Alexei Tsydenov,2022-05-31T15:15:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region","Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with Head of the Republic of Buryatia Alexei Tsydenov, via videoconference. The head of the region reported to the President on the socioeconomic situation in the region.","Alexei Tsydenov spoke about what has been done in the region over the five years that he has been heading it. Over the period, more than 1,500 kilometres of roads and 78 bridges have been repaired and a new runway has been built. As per the President's instruction, the region broke ground for a third bridge over the Uda River in Ulan-Ude. Thanks to the President's decision to subsidise air transportation, the number of passengers travelling through the Ulan-Ude airport has doubled. In five years, 27 new kindergartens and 18 schools have been built. With Government support, 17 more schools, kindergartens and nurseries will be built in 2022 and 2023. Buryatia now has 85 new healthcare centres including a surgical wing at the children's hospital, a perinatal centre, a nuclear medicine centre, as well as new health centres and outpatient clinics in rural areas. A cutting-edge cancer early treatment centre with 150 beds has been completed. As for culture facilities, a new national library has been built; rural culture centres and libraries are being built in villages and towns, as well as rural cinemas. Over the past five years, the region has built 71 new sports facilities, including sports grounds, football pitches, and wrestling gyms. Bigger ones include an indoor archery range and a martial arts centre; the construction of an ice arena is nearing completion. As for the region's core economic sector, which is agriculture, last year Buryatia saw an all-time record grain harvest. Buryatia has begun the development of the largest zinc deposit in Russia, the Ozyorny mining and processing plant. The local aircraft plant, the bridge building plant, the locomotive repair plant, and the pulp and cardboard mill have enough contracts to keep them running and have secured more for the future. The Baikal Textile Plant has opened. Local housing construction is growing thanks to subsidised mortgages and other support measures. Alexei Tsydenov thanked the President for his attention to Baikal. On direct instructions from the President, the region has begun building treatment facilities and protective dams. The uniqueness of Lake Baikal is also a tourist advantage, and last year, investors became more active in building hotels and tourism infrastructure in the area. The Head of Buryatia dwelt on the issue of substantial air pollution, a problem that has been troubling Ulan-Ude residents for many years. The city has 67,000 private homes with coal or wood heating. Local authorities believe that electric heaters are the only possible solution. Power grid modernisation projects would cost an estimated seven billion rubles. Alexei Tsydenov asked the President to support this proposal. Mr Tsydenov also raised the issue of cooperation with Mongolia, which borders Buryatia. Cultural exchanges are expanding, and a number of economic projects are underway. Mr Tsydenov noted that Mongolia needed agricultural specialists, veterinary doctors, medical personnel, engineering experts, construction workers and Russian language teachers. Buryatia trains specialists in all these fields. Consequently, the Head of Buryatia suggested establishing a modern inter-university campus involving all local universities. The campus would primarily accommodate students from Mongolia and, possibly, northern China and Korea. The Ministry of Education and Science is now conducting a tender for the best national campus construction project for the 2023–2025 period. Mr Tsydenov suggested setting up such a campus in the republic. The Head of Buryatia also noted that service personnel from the republic were involved in the special military operation in Ukraine. They are honourably carrying out their duty, protecting people and facilitating Russia's strategic security. The Russian Defence Ministry nominated Lieutenant Baldan Tsydypov for the title of Hero of Russia. He was severely wounded, his foot was amputated, and he will need many more operations. During an unexpected attack on his convoy, he turned around his armoured personnel carrier, engaged superior enemy forces and disabled enemy equipment, eventually saving 150 of his comrades. Mr Tsydenov asked the President to support the Defence Ministry's recommendation that he be awarded the title of Hero of Russia. Vladimir Putin said he supported this proposal and added that relevant instructions to deal with the other matters raised by Mr Tsydenov would be submitted to the Government. At the same time, the President noted that there were high-priority matters that needed attention, such as rundown and dilapidated housing. The solution to this problem is within reach. Vladimir Putin instructed Mr Tsydenov to discuss this matter with the Government and to find a solution on the basis of existing legislative decisions. Vladimir Putin also noted positive industrial and agricultural trends in the republic but underscored persisting high unemployment levels. The President advised Mr Tsydenov to pay special attention to the labour market, all the more so as there are some attractive investment projects requiring a substantial workforce. All one has to do is organise the relevant work. The President thanked Mr Tsydenov for his work and wished him every success."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68533,Meeting with Head of Udmurtia Alexander Brechalov,2022-05-31T11:05:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region","The President held a working meeting, via videoconference, with Head of the Udmurt Republic Alexander Brechalov. They discussed the region's socioeconomic development.","Alexander Brechalov began his report by describing the situation in healthcare. The region has been focusing on overcoming a shortage of medical personnel; the staffing level at hospitals has increased by 35 percent since 2017. In the past five years, 90 rural health centres have opened, two outpatient clinics have been built, as well as a clinic in Izhevsk; 349 pieces of medical equipment have been purchased, as well as 149 ambulances. A new tuberculosis hospital will be completed in 2023. Reporting on education in the region, Alexander Brechalov spoke about the construction of kindergartens and schools, the activities of the centre for gifted children, and the implementation of the major repairs programme for local schools. Turning to economic issues, the regional head said that in the first quarter of this year, the industrial production index was 111 percent, and manufacturing, 120 percent. Udmurtia has 12 defence plants. Last year, the share of their civilian and dual-use products amounted to 26 percent. This year, ten major projects will be implemented with a total investment of almost 7 billion rubles, and about 1,500 new jobs will be created. Alexander Brechalov also spoke about the development of the Votkinsk plant and said that the Kupol electromechanical plant in Izhevsk rolled out almost three billion rubles' worth of civilian products last year. The regional industry has been successfully adapting to new challenges. Nika Petrotech has implemented a joint project with Transneft to launch domestic production of additives for oil transportation. This product used to be imported from the UK. The Izhevsk Mechanical Plant is capable of producing 3,000 cardiac pacemakers, and the Sarapul Electric Generator Plant launched the production of tram engines in May. These are all examples of import substitution projects. According to the head of Udmurtia, the situation on the labour market is stable. With 6,000 people officially unemployed, the number of available job openings is about 17,000. He also spoke about agriculture, noting in particular that Udmurtia was among the leaders in milk production. It is also implementing Russia's first dairy farming genetics project. The President noted that industrial production is growing in Udmurtia, the construction sector is growing, the share of dilapidated housing is below the national average, and unemployment is lower, too. These figures indicate strong performance, but it is also important that people actually feel these positive trends. At the same time, Vladimir Putin pointed out a few matters that require additional effort, in particular, the debt burden of the local defence industry enterprises. This requires special attention from both the federal government and regional authorities, the President said, and where these companies can be helped out, this must be done. On the whole, the President thanked Alexander Brechalov for his work. The head of Udmurtia said he wanted to ask the President for support on four important issues, and that the corresponding letters had been sent. Vladimir Putin confirmed that he had seen them and had already issued the necessary instructions to the Government. In conclusion, Alexander Brechalov said Udmurtia had far-reaching plans for the coming years, and he would like to continue working, with the support of the President. He said he was going to run in the upcoming elections for head of Udmurtia. Vladimir Putin wished him good luck."

The President of Russia informed the other parties at length about the latest events in the context of the ongoing special military operation, noting that the Russian Armed Forces are strictly observing the norms of international humanitarian law, and spoke about the systematic work being carried out to establish peaceful life in Mariupol and other liberated cities in Donbass. Special attention was paid to the progress on the negotiation track, which has been stalling through Kiev's fault. Vladimir Putin reaffirmed the Russian side's openness to the resumption of dialogue. The President of Russia was critical of the continued dangerous practice of pumping Ukraine with Western weapons, cautioning against the risks of the country's further destabilisation and aggravation of the humanitarian crisis. The parties reviewed in detail the global food security concerns. Vladimir Putin explained the real reasons for the unstable food supplies, saying that the disruptions were due to Western countries' erroneous economic and financial policies, as well as their anti-Russia sanctions. He substantiated his statements with evidence and specific data. Russia, on the other hand, is ready to help find options for unhindered grain exports, including the export of Ukrainian grain from the Black Sea ports. Increasing the supplies of Russian fertilisers and agricultural produce will also help reduce tensions in the global food market, but that will definitely require the lifting of the relevant sanctions. The leaders agreed to continue contacts."

Your professional holiday is one of the brightest symbols of continuity and unity of truly heroic traditions, a symbol of people's gratitude and respect for all those who in different historical eras strengthened, protected and defended the borders of our native land. Your military service has always been both arduous and honourable. It requires courage, tenacity, and constant vigilance. You have to be ready to stand in the way of all enemies. We remember and honour the exploits of all generations of border guards who served in patrols and guard lines, in garrisons of border fortresses and border guard units. In June 1941, the fighters of the Soviet frontier posts fearlessly engaged in the first heavy combat despite being outnumbered, and then valiantly battled on the fronts of the Great Patriotic War and in the partisan detachments, carried out special and sensitive missions, made a huge contribution to the final and complete defeat of the aggressor, to the eradication of the Banderites and other henchmen of the Nazis, to the destruction of the criminal nationalist underground. Comrades, The tasks you are facing are particularly important now, given the unprecedented political, economic and information pressure on our country and the build-up of NATO military capacity in direct proximity to Russia's borders. I would like to single out the well-coordinated and courageous actions of the staff of the Russian Border Guard Service in preventing all manner of provocation and subversion. I am referring primarily to the sections of our state border in the areas of our special military operation. I also wish to highlight the consistent work of your service to identify militants of neo-Nazi groups, your participation in organising the safe passage of refugees, and helping women, children and the elderly, and all those who seek refuge and protection on Russian territory. And of course, I expect you to effectively and professionally handle the full range of other critically important tasks facing the Border Guards, including those affecting the economic security of our country. I am convinced that you will continue to act with firmness and resolve, carrying out your military and patriotic duty to the Homeland and the people of Russia with honour. I wish you and your families health, success and wellbeing. Happy holiday to you! Happy Border Guards Day!"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68494,Meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council,2022-05-27T14:20:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow","Vladimir Putin attended, via videoconference, a meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council.","Taking part in the meeting were Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan, President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko, President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, President of Kyrgyzstan Sadyr Japarov, President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev as the head of EAEU observer state, and Chairman of the Eurasian Economic Commission Board Mikhail Myasnikovich. President of Cuba Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez sent a video address to the meeting participants as the head of EAEU observer state. A package of documents was approved following the meeting. In particular, a decision was made to begin talks on signing a free trade agreement with the Republic of Indonesia. The main benchmarks for the EAEU member states' macroeconomic policy for 2022–2023 were determined. * * * Address at the meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues. I share the views of those who have given a positive assessment of the EAEU performance in their statements. It is true that integration development is gathering momentum within the framework of the EAEU, and the efficiency of our common markets of goods, services, capital and workforce is increasing. Moving one step at a time, we are creating a comprehensive common economic space of the EAEU. As mentioned earlier, on May 29 we will mark eight years since the signing of the fundamental Treaty on the Eurasian Economic Union. Over that period of time, we have covered a large part of the road, boosting cooperation on the principles of equal dialogue and mutual respect, and trying to strengthen, and strengthening, our Eurasian union. We have done this very expeditiously, turning the EAEU into an effective and influential regional economic body and organisation. We can report substantial achievements in the key spheres of our cooperation, namely trade, the industry, finance and agriculture. Most importantly, the citizens of our countries can see the practical effect of our integration, which we have been working on consistently, in everyday life. We wholeheartedly support the draft decision to declare May 29 the Day of the Eurasian Economic Union. Our calendar will have one more landmark day, which unites our nations and symbolises the commitment of the EAEU states to integration development. Eurasian integration is really paying off, as you can see from the economic indicators. Mutual trade between the EAEU member states has been growing consistently. According to available information, our trade increased by approximately one-third in 2021 to $72.6 billion. The member states' aggregate GDP grew by 4.6 percent (4.7 percent in Russia), industrial production by 5.3 percent, investments in fixed assets by 6.8 percent, completed construction projects by 5.4 percent, the construction of housing by 12 percent, and cargo turnover by 4.7 percent. It is notable that our cooperation is based on plans and is developing systematically. We are working persistently to implement the programme of the strategic development of Eurasian economic integration until 2025. Our countries' economic and regulatory authorities continue their efforts to identify and eliminate the remaining restrictions and barriers to the free movement of goods, services, capital and workforce in the EAEU internal market. In the last two years alone, 30 such restrictions have been lifted. And of course, life itself dictates the need to create a truly barrier-free market across the EAEU territory. We are all certain that closer integration will make our countries stronger, economically, and significantly reduce dependence on external factors, including political ones. The advantages of the integration policy are especially obvious now, in the current difficult international situation, amid real aggression on the part of certain unfriendly states. The President of Belarus mentioned this specifically, here. But we would like to note that the Russian Government is making timely decisions to ensure the stable, confident functioning of the markets and the financial sector. Much attention is paid to supporting key industries and major employers. The rules for doing business have been significantly simplified – the administrative burden has been dramatically reduced to ensure as much freedom as possible for entrepreneurs. We are also working to increase the availability of financing for businesses' operational expenses and to maintain bank liquidity. To this end, we are expanding the practice of mutual payments for goods in national currencies with the countries that have proved reliable partners of Russia. By the way, the share of payments in national currencies in the EAEU countries has already reached 75 percent. In this regard, I would like to note that at Russia's initiative, the Eurasian Five have adopted a number of urgent anti-crisis measures aimed at minimising the consequences of sanctions, increasing the resilience of our economies, strengthening their macroeconomic stability, and helping entrepreneurs and citizens of our states. The Eurasian Economic Commission has approved more than 30 anti-crisis measures, and they have certainly had an effect. Three packages of measures have been approved since March to streamline customs regulation, putting an end to the duties on more than 1,600 critical imports. As a result, importers will be able to save up to $800 million over the next six months. In addition, the requirements of the EAEU technical regulations have been relaxed. To restrain prices, the Commission raised the threshold for the duty-free import of goods for personal use to 1,000 euros. Steps are being taken to replace imports and further deepen industrial cooperation between the EAEU countries in strategic sectors, including civil aircraft construction and pharmaceuticals. An interstate programme is being prepared to expand the digital infrastructure in the EAEU countries. More digital solutions are being deployed to serve logistics corridors; high-tech customs administration services are being introduced; e-commerce is being developed and improved. I consider it important that we prioritise efforts to ensure food security. You know that the global situation is rather complicated. Our countries are making a major contribution to resolving these problems, and Russia and all other members of our organisation are acting in a highly responsible manner. Today, our five countries produce enough foodstuffs and agricultural produce to fully meet domestic demand. Considering the fact that the EAEU is the largest agricultural exporter in the world, as I have already said, our organisation implements all possible measures, including customs tariff and non-tariff regulation, for maintaining sustainable supply chains. Colleagues, we are pleased that, despite the complicated international situation, the confrontation unleashed by the collective West, and our ill-wishers who are trying to hamper our integration in every possible way, all of us can clearly see that many foreign partners are becoming more and more interested in the activities of the Eurasian Economic Union. Our colleagues have noted this right now. Active talks are now underway to conclude a full-fledged free trade agreement with Iran, among others (we have already mentioned these countries). This agreement aims to replace the current temporary 2018 agreement, which has already expanded the Union's trade volumes with the Islamic Republic of Iran. By late 2021, trade soared by 73.5 percent and reached $5 billion. EAEU exports increased 2.1-fold, to reach $3.4 billion. To preserve the existing preferential trade treatment with Iran, we support a decision to extend the temporary agreement, pending the signing of a new free trade agreement. We also deem it advisable to speed up talks on signing a free trade agreement with Egypt and to launch similar talks with Indonesia. In addition, we need to explore the possibility of signing a preferential trade agreement with the United Arab Emirates. In conclusion, I would also like to thank President of Kyrgyzstan Sadyr Japarov for the excellent organisation of our work. We are noting the efforts of Kyrgyzstan, as president of the Eurasian Economic Union, to ensure the effective performance of our association throughout 2022, and we strive to provide all possible assistance to our Kyrgyz friends. We will continue to do so in the future. I would like to emphasise once again that Russia prioritises deeper allied ties with all EAEU states. We hope very much that our closest partners, including Uzbekistan, will move in a direction that meets the interests of Uzbekistan, and that they will also develop our association accordingly, while assessing all the advantages of intra-EAEU cooperation. In turn, we will do our best to maintain integration processes in the Eurasian region. Thank you."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68491,Working meeting with Head of the Republic of Karelia Artur Parfenchikov,2022-05-27T12:00:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow","Head of the Republic of Karelia Artur Parfenchikov reported to the President, via videoconference, on the region's performance.","Artur Parfenchikov said that in recent years, thanks to federal support and the maximum use of their own capabilities, the situation in the republic has changed dramatically. At the end of last year, regional revenues almost doubled compared to the 2017 level. Industrial production, in comparable prices, grew by almost 12 percent, and investment, by 40 percent, exceeding 70 billion rubles. The region is establishing technology parks to promote economic growth and support entrepreneurship. Russia's first stone processing technopark has opened in Petrozavodsk; the Karelian Products Technopark is being created now; there are plans to set up a technopark for packaging as part of the country's import substitution policy. All these projects enjoy the support of the Ministry of Economic Development. The unprecedented sanctions pressure on Russia has also opened up new opportunities for the development of domestic production. For example, Petrozavodskmash foundry, a major industrial enterprise in Karelia, has seen a dramatic increase in the volume of contracts, including those to supply engine and turbine frames – these products used to be imported. As for agriculture, in 2018, the region discontinued the practice of rezoning agricultural land as forest reserves. To date, 14,000 hectares of land have been reinstated as cropland. The number of local farms increased 2.5 times over. State-owned agricultural companies are also expanding; there are four of them in the republic, including two state stock breeding farms. Karelia is one of the top three Russian fish farming regions. The republic accounts for 70 percent of all Russian trout. Projects are being considered to build feed plants as well as fish hatchery and fingerlings production businesses. New environmentally friendly technologies are being introduced in fish farming and fish processing. The first projects have been launched in the White Sea in the Arctic. Berry farming is a new and promising segment of local agriculture. Last year, the gross harvest of fruits and berries in all categories of farm exceeded 4,000 tonnes, which was almost twice the 2018 figure. According to the regional head, Karelia will be able to reach a leading position in this segment and to compete with the top manufacturers, even foreign ones. Forestry and the timber sector are a vital part of the republic's economy. Karelia is implementing a pilot project to introduce a model of intensive use and reproduction of forests. The republic has implemented the President's instruction to reduce the export of timber. Timber exports have been reduced by nearly 50 percent and timber processing in the republic has increased by 30 percent. Various rating agencies assess Karelia as one of the best tourism regions in Russia. The number of registered tourists and travellers in Karelia was 957,000 last year, an increase of 14 percent compared to 2020. The President was also updated on the development of the housing construction sector, the relocation of people from dilapidated housing, the modernisation of the healthcare system, construction of social facilities, development of vocational education and the implementation of the Safe and High-Quality Roads national project. Over the past five years, more than 600 kilometres of regional roads have been repaired in the republic, which is 12 times more than in the previous five years. The head of the republic asked for the President's support in matters of gas supply, the reduction of electricity rates and the revival of intra-regional air services. Artur Parfenchikov noted that his term as the Head of the Republic of Karelia expires this year, which is why it is important for him to know the President's opinion about his performance and career prospects. Vladimir Putin replied that the situation in the republic was complicated when Parfenchikov became head of the republic, but the current trends were positive. He pointed out the growth of the gross regional product and investment in fixed assets. The President added that he expected Artur Parfenchikov to use the available positive trends when dealing with priority issues, notably support the labour market with investments, maintain stability, improve the situation in single-industry cities, and settle the problem of water supply and water treatment. He said that it was a major issue that could not be settled without support from the federal centre. Applications from the republic will be forwarded to the relevant government agencies. The President asked Artur Parfenchikov to coordinate these matters thoroughly together with the colleagues in the Government. He said that everything possible would be done to help the head of the republic. Vladimir Putin also said that the experience which Artur Parfenchikov gained as head of the republic would have a positive effect on his work in this position during the next term and wished him success."

Murat Kumpilov updated the President on the socioeconomic development of the republic over the past five years.","According to Murat Kumpilov, the GRP has grown by 116 percent; the industrial production index was 125 percent. For the past five years, internal income has grown by 50 percent. In 2022, the growth rate is 126 percent. The region's dependence on subsidies has dropped to 15 percent. The republic's debt load is low: the state debt has dropped by 22 percent and is 21 percent of the region's internal income. The volume of investment was 173 billion rubles. Murat Kumpilov also told the President about housing construction, the development of agriculture and the construction of social facilities. In the past five years, five schools, 18 kindergartens, four hospitals, four outpatient clinics, 30 first-aid stations, four houses of culture and 14 fitness centres have been built in the republic. Many social facilities have been renovated and undergone a major overhaul; a lot of infrastructure has been built. In previous years, Mr Kumpilov said, much had been accomplished in Adygea, but even more activities and objectives lie ahead as part of state programmes, national projects and investment projects. Murat Kumpilov said that he was ready to continue the work and expressed hope that the President, and, of course, the republic's residents, will support him. Vladimir Putin noted that there were many positive and sustainable trends in the republic, such as the growth of GRP, industrial production, and other indices. At the same time, the President pointed out that the volume of investment has somewhat dropped. Murat Kumpilov explained that in 2020, a major project on wind power was implemented, including the construction of 60 wind turbines with a total capacity of 150 MW. This year, there are plans to implement 25 investment projects worth 77 billion rubles. These include such major projects as the development of the Lago-Naki resort and an industrial park. Therefore, the republic is expecting a boost in investment and the creation of new jobs. Vladimir Putin also emphasised that there is another important area of development, namely, the labour market. This is important for the country in general, and especially for the Caucasus. The President mentioned that he had reviewed Mr Kumpilov's appeals related to healthcare and the allocation of additional funds from the reserve fund. Overall, the President said, the situation is stable and is on the rise, and he promised he would submit relevant instructions to the Government of the Russian Federation. Vladimir Putin thanked Mr Kumpilov for his work and wished him success."

It plays a vital economic role by connecting our country with Asian states and offers excellent opportunities for the development of the adjacent Russian regions. Of course, the Chuya Motorway is also a unique tourist route that attracts travellers with ravishing views of primordial nature, valuable archaeological and historical landmarks and the hospitality of nearby towns and villages.

The leaders thoroughly discussed the status of global food security. Having noted that Russia is being groundlessly accused of disrupting global food supplies, Vladimir Putin emphasised that these difficulties had been caused, in part, by failures in production and supply chains, as well as the financial policy of the Western countries during the coronavirus pandemic. The US- and EU-imposed anti-Russia restrictions have made a bad situation worse. Vladimir Putin stressed that the Russian Federation is willing to make a substantial contribution to overcoming the food crisis by exporting grain and fertiliser on the condition that the West removes its politically-motivated restrictions. While discussing energy security issues, the Russian leader reaffirmed Russia's willingness to continue failsafe natural gas supplies to Italy at contractual prices."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68484,First Eurasian Economic Forum,2022-05-26T14:25:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow","Vladimir Putin addressed the plenary session of the 1st Eurasian Economic Forum, via videoconference.","Also attending the meeting were Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan, President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Zhomart Tokayev, President of Kyrgyzstan Sadyr Japarov, Prime Minister of Belarus Roman Golovchenko, and Chairman of the Board of the Eurasian Economic Commission Mikhail Myasnikovich. The forum moderator was Alexander Shokhin, President of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, member of the Presidium of the EAEU Business Council. The purpose of the Eurasian Economic Forum, established by a decision of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council and timed to coincide with a meeting of the SEEC, is to further deepen economic cooperation between the EAEU member states. The EEF 2022 in Bishkek, themed Eurasian Economic Integration in the Era of Global Shifts: New Investment Opportunities, will focus on promising areas for the strategic development of integration. The participants will discuss ways to deepen industrial, energy, transport, financial, and digital cooperation. * * * Address at the plenary session of the 1st Eurasian Economic Forum. President of Russia Vladimir Putin: I am grateful for this opportunity to address you, to speak on the issues which you [Alexander Shokhin] have raised and which, as you suggested, should be addressed in greater detail. First of all, I would like to thank President of Kyrgyzstan Sadyr Japarov and his team for organising this event. I can see many people in the audience, including businesspeople and government officials. I am sure that the media will take a keen interest in the forum. This is what I would like to begin with when answering your question. The development of Eurasian integration has no connection whatsoever to current developments or market conditions. We established this organisation many years ago. In fact, we established it at the initiative of the First President of Kazakhstan [Nursultan Nazarbayev]. I remember very well the main conversation we had on that issue, on that subject, when he said, ""You must choose what is more important to you: working more actively and more closely with your direct neighbours and natural partners, or prioritising, for example, admission to the World Trade Organisation."" It was in this connection that we had to make decisions. And although we were interested in joining the WTO and in developing relations accordingly with our Western partners, as you said and as I continue to say, we nevertheless regarded as our main priority the development of relations with our direct and natural neighbours within the common economic framework of the Soviet Union. This is my first point. The second. Already at that time, we started developing ties – I will speak about this later – within the framework of the Greater Eurasian Partnership. Our motivation was not the political situation but global economic trends, because the centre of economic development is gradually – we are aware of this, and our businesspeople are aware of this – is gradually moving, continues to move into the Asia-Pacific Region. Of course, we understand the tremendous advantages of high technology in advanced economies. This is obvious. We are not going to shut ourselves off from it. There are attempts to oust us from this area a little but this is simply unrealistic in the modern world. It is impossible. If we do not separate ourselves by putting up a wall, nobody will be able to isolate such a country as Russia. Speaking not only about Russia, but also about our partners in the EAEU and the world in general, this task is completely unfeasible. Moreover, those who are trying to fulfil it harm themselves the most. No matter how sustainable the economies of the countries pursuing this shortsighted policy are, the current state of the global economy shows that our position is right and justified, even in terms of macroeconomic indicators. These advanced economies have not had such inflation for the past 40 years; unemployment is growing, logistics chains are breaking and global crises are growing in such sensitive areas as food. This is no joke. It is a serious factor affecting the entire system of economic and political relations. Meanwhile, these sanctions and bans are aimed at constraining and weakening the countries that are pursuing an independent policy, and they ate not limited to Russia or even China. I do not doubt for a second that there are many countries that want to and will pursue an independent policy and their number is growing. No world policeman will be able to stop this global process. There will not be enough power for this and the desire to do so will evaporate due to a host of domestic problems in those countries. I hope they will eventually realise that this policy has no prospects whatsoever. Violating rules and norms in international finances and trade is counterproductive. In simple words, it will only lead to problems for those who are doing it. Theft of foreign assets has never done any good to anyone, primarily those who are engaged in these unseemly deeds. As it has transpired now, neglect for the political and security interests of other countries leads to chaos and economic upheavals with global repercussions. Western countries are sure that any persona non grata who has their own point of view and is ready to defend it can be deleted from the world economy, politics, culture and sports. In fact, this is nonsense, and, as I said, it is impossible to make this happen. We can see it. Mr Shokhin, as a representative of our business, you certainly face problems, especially in the field of supply chains and transport, but nevertheless, everything can be adjusted, everything can be built in a new way. Not without losses at a certain stage, but it leads to the fact that we really become stronger in some ways. In any case, we are definitely acquiring new skills and are starting to focus our economic, financial, and administrative resources on breakthrough areas. True, not all the import substitution goals were achieved in previous years. But it is impossible to achieve everything: life is faster than administrative decisions, it develops faster. But there is no problem. We have done everything necessary in key areas that ensure our sovereignty. Let us move on. After all, import substitution is not a pill for every ill, and we are not going to deal exclusively with import substitution. We are just going to develop. But we will continue to arrange import substitution in those areas where we are forced to do so. Yes, maybe with some mixed results, but definitely we will only become stronger thanks to this, especially in the field of high technologies. Look, after the CoCom lists – I have already spoken about this many times – after what you said about our work, for instance, within the same former G8 and so on, restrictions still remained. In the most sensitive areas, everything was still closed. In fact, fundamentally – I want to emphasise this – nothing has changed fundamentally. These issues related to large-block assemblies and so on, it took so much effort to increase localisation within the country, in our economy, in the real sectors of the economy, in industry. And even then we did not agree on key issues in many respects. Actually, import substitution was necessary to create not just assembly shops, but also engineering centres and research centres. This is inevitable for any country that wants to increase its economic, financial and ultimately political sovereignty. It is inevitable. This is why we have been doing it, and not because the current state of affairs demands it from us, but simply because life itself demanded this, and we were active. And, of course, we will work actively within the framework of the Eurasian Economic Union and within the CIS in general, we will work with the regions of Asia, Latin America and Africa. But I assure you, and you can see it yourselves, many of our companies from Europe, our partners from Europe, have announced that they are leaving. You know, sometimes when we look at those who are leaving, we ask ourselves: isn't it a good thing that they have left? We will take up their niches: our business and our production – they have matured, and they will safely take root on the ground that our partners have prepared. Nothing will change. And those who want to bring in some luxury goods, they will be able to do so. Well, it will be a little more expensive for them, but these are people who are already driving Mercedes S 600, and will continue to do so. I assure you, they will bring them from anywhere, from any country. That is not what is important for us. What is important for the country, for its development – I have already said this and I will repeat it – are the engineering centres and research centres that are the basis of our own development. This is what we must think about and what we must work on both within the EAEU and in a broad sense with our partners – those who want to cooperate with us. We have a very good base that we inherited from the old days, we only need to support it and to invest resources there. As for those areas, in which we did not invest appropriate resources before, including, say, administrative resources, relying on the fact that everything can be bought by selling oil and gas, life itself has now forced us to invest there. And thank God that this has happened. I do not see any problem here with the fact that we have not completed something in the field of import substitution. We will not do it just because the current economic situation forces us to do so, but only because it is in the interests of our country. The Eurasian Economic Union has developed a roadmap for industrialisation, with over 180 projects with a total investment of over $300 billion. A programme for agricultural development has been prepared, including more than 170 projects worth $16 billion. Russia has something to offer here, and businesspeople are well aware of this. We have grown to be highly competitive at the global level, in the global markets. Russia remains – if we speak about agriculture – the largest exporter of wheat, number one in the world. Until recently, we were buying it – now we are selling it, number one in the world. True, countries such as the United States or China produce even more, but they also consume more. But Russia has become number one in international trade. Our high-tech industries are growing successfully, too. And we would like to continue growing together with our EAEU partners. We can and should restore our collaborative competencies. I have discussed this with my colleagues, with the President of Kazakhstan and the Prime Minister of Armenia – not because some of Russia's IT workers have moved to Armenia, not at all. They are free to relocate and work anywhere, and God bless them. But again, it is a certain challenge for us: it means we must create better conditions. We have opportunities to work with the Republic of Belarus in a number of areas of cooperation, and we will definitely do this, because the Republic of Belarus has retained certain expertise that is very important for us, including in microelectronics. President Lukashenko and I just met in Sochi and talked about it, and even agreed to set aside funding for those projects in Belarus. The products that these enterprises, these industries will make will enjoy demand in Russia. This is a very interesting and promising area. The EAEU countries have laid the foundation for a common digital landscape, including a unified products traceability system. Various platform solutions are being developed, for example, the Work without Borders search system. The project is very important for all our countries. Despite all the crises and challenges caused by the current political situation, labour migrants continue to send almost as much money home from Russia as before. Moreover, some countries are receiving even more money now, as my colleagues from the CIS have told me. The practice of payments in national currencies is expanding, which is very important. Notably, their share in the mutual trade of the Union's countries has already reached 75 percent. We will continue to work on interlinking our national payment systems and bank cards. We believe it is important to expedite the dialogue on internal international financial and payment mechanisms, such as transitioning from SWIFT to direct correspondent contacts between the banks of the friendly countries, including through the Russian Central Bank's financial messaging system. We also propose strengthening cooperation with key lending and financial centres in the Asia-Pacific Region. New topics related to Eurasian integration include developing cooperation in green technology, environmental protection and energy saving. We expect to receive support and proactive suggestions from the business community. Colleagues, In the current international conditions when, unfortunately, traditional trade and economic links and supply chains are being disrupted, Russia's initiative to form a Greater Eurasian Partnership– an initiative we have been discussing for many years – is gaining a special meaning. We are thankful to the leaders of the EAEU countries for supporting this proposal from the very beginning. BRICS members such as China and India as well as several other countries also supported creating a Greater Eurasian Partnership. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, ASEAN and other organisations have shown interest in this initiative. Here, I would like to mention several specific ideas pertaining to the comprehensive development of the Greater Eurasian Partnership. First, it is reasonable to develop shared institutions for specific growth points, including creating a Eurasian export centre and trade houses, expediting the establishment of a Eurasian reinsurance company, examining the issue of developing special trans-border economic zones, probably even with supranational authority. The second point. It is important to step up the EAEU's cooperation with foreign partners and inform them about the benefits and advantages of working with the EAEU and of our key projects and plans. My colleagues know that interest in our association is growing. In this context, the EAEU Business Council could play a significant role. It is already successfully developing ties beyond our union. Its business dialogue system may become an example for a potential business cooperation platform in Greater Eurasia. That said, as I have already noted, it would be desirable to support the freedom of business initiative, the creative activity of business, of our investors. I suggest creating additional, better incentives for this purpose and investing more in Eurasian projects. Naturally, the companies representing national businesses of the EAEU countries must receive priority support. My third point. It is time to draft a comprehensive strategy for developing large-scale Eurasian partnership. It must reflect the key international challenges facing us, determine future goals and contain instruments and mechanisms for achieving them. We must consider further steps in developing our system of trade and investment agreements, in part, with the participation of the SCO, ASEAN and BRICS member countries. In fact, we may draft new agreements that will develop and supplement WTO rules. In this context, it is important to pay attention not only to tariffs but also to the removal of non-tariff barriers. This may produce considerable results without subjecting our national economies to risks. In conclusion, I would like to say the following. It would be no exaggeration to say that Greater Eurasia is a big civilisational project. The main idea is to create a common space for equitable cooperation for regional organisations. The Greater Eurasian Partnership is designed to change the political and economic architecture and guarantee stability and prosperity on the entire continent – naturally, taking account of the diverse development models, cultures and traditions of all nations. I am confident, and this is obvious anyway, that this centre would attract a big audience. I would like to wish success and productive cooperation to all participants of the Eurasian Economic Forum. Thank you for your attention. Thank you."

Presidential Commissioner for Entrepreneurs' Rights Boris Titov Titov BorisPresidential Commissioner for Entrepreneurs' Rights: Yes, the annual report, as always on Entrepreneur Day. Vladimir Putin: It is already the ninth. Boris Titov: As always on this day, May 26, we would like to congratulate all entrepreneurs and deliver our report, if possible. Vladimir Putin: And it is my pleasure to do the same. Our domestic businesses are displaying their best qualities in what I would describe as difficult conditions. They are adapting quickly enough to them. I know how difficult it is to find new partners, to build new supply chains, and to maintain production, services and quality at high level. All this requires a lot of effort and talent, I would say. Boris Titov: And willpower. Vladimir Putin: And willpower. Coupled with a sense of responsibility, all this is allowing the overwhelming majority of our entrepreneurs to produce very good results. Boris Titov: Thank you very much, Mr President. Here is the report. Indeed, this year is our tenth anniversary. I am referring to the institution of the Commissioner for Entrepreneurs' Rights: you signed an executive order to establish it in 2012. As always, the report covers the institution and the regions– we are now working in all regions of the Russian Federation. A particular feature of this year is that this is a special report on how the business climate has changed over these 10 years. I would like to say that, of course, much has changed for the better during this time. Oversight activities have undergone a positive change. They are completely different now. The number of inspections has decreased by three times during this period and fines have decreased six times over. The guillotine that chopped off regulations… Vladimir Putin: Unnecessary ones. Boris Titov: It has cut off 33 percent of them, so now businesses are faced with a much smaller number of regulatory requirements. This is why it is a very positive factor. The attitude of businesses to the judicial system and law-enforcement bodies has begun to improve a bit. It would be wrong to say that everything is positive here but the trend has emerged and entrepreneurs feel somewhat better. Of course, criminal prosecution of businesses is the main problem that remains outstanding. I would like to show you the figures. Unfortunately, even in the pandemic year of 2020 the number of criminal cases increased by almost 25 percent. They were all for violations of economic statutes, including fraud, Article 159. The number of cases brought to court went up by another 7.7 percent even in 2021. As you remember, we paid significant attention to this. The figures started coming down a bit but they still stand at about 15 percent. So, for the time being we still have to resolve this problem, as before. I must say that much is being done. The Prosecutor's Office is helping us a lot in this respect– we study closely every single case. As for oversight activities, it simply issued an order: the Prosecutor-General prohibited the office from interfering in the economic activities of businesses and this was of great help in improving the situation. But, of course, we still have to make progress on criminal cases. Vladimir Putin: The number of people in pre-trial detention centres… Boris Titov: At one time it started falling. Vladimir Putin: Yes, this was in 2019. Is it growing now? Boris Titov: Unfortunately, it has started growing again. But we must separate them from those who are charged under economic statutes but are not entrepreneurs. We have now learned to do this because now we are conducting statistics by registration forms in cooperation with the Federal Penitentiary Service. If a person in a pre-trial detention centre or prison has registered as an entrepreneur, if his profession… Vladimir Putin: Leave me the papers. Boris Titov: Yes, yes, of course. Out of 6,000 people, 2,400 are entrepreneurs. We started tracking these statistics only this year. Vladimir Putin: The task of the state is to remove red tape from these activities, to help people, not to interfere with their business, and to eventually reduce this burden, while retaining the right to oversight, especially over the areas linked with public health and safety. Boris Titov: You know, oversight activities have become less intensive and there are fewer inspections but the amount of harm done in the country is practically unchanged. In other words, things have not become any worse and people's rights continue to be protected as before. Vladimir Putin: But life must become better. In fact, in the current conditions, expanding the zone of freedom is a response to everything that is happening outside, a response to outside pressure. Boris Titov: These are exactly the words we want to hear because only economic and business freedoms can maintain and grow the economy under this pressure. Vladimir Putin: We will certainly keep to this path. That is for sure. We will definitely follow this path carefully so as not to do damage to our society, to our people. I know that you certainly have some side questions linked with specific problems. Boris Titov: Yes, I do. Vladimir Putin: Let us discuss them. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68481,State Council Presidium meeting on social support,2022-05-25T18:45:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin held a meeting of the State Council Presidium in the Kremlin to discuss social support issues.,"Among those invited were First Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office and Chairman of the State Council Commission on Coordinating and Evaluating the Regional Executive Bodies' Performance Sergei Kiriyenko, Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova, Presidential Aide Maxim Oreshkin, Minister of Labour and Social Protection Anton Kotyakov, Minister of Education Sergei Kravtsov, Minster of Economic Development Maxim Reshetnikov, Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov and Minister of Science and Higher Education Valery Falkov. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues. Social support is on our agenda today. There are many routine issues but this is what I would like to start with. You may have noticed that I have just been at the [Central Military Clinical] Hospital of the Defence Ministry. I met with our servicemen who are undergoing treatment after being wounded and injured. And some of them – at any rate most of those I spoke with – still have not received any state awards. Of course, they will. But why am I talking about this? Regardless of what awards they have or will have, these people are risking their health and lives for the sake of people and children in Donbass, for the sake of Russia. All of them are heroes. This is exactly what they are. Each of them intentionally put their life in mortal danger. This is how they should be treated — as heroes. Why am I talking about this? I had a brief talk with the medics, too. They are saying they have everything they need. I believe this is true. They have everything to render qualified medical aid to our guys who were wounded and are undergoing treatment now. All of them want to return to the ranks, all of them. But I would still like the Government to pay attention to the medical side of this, to get a sense and understanding of what is happening there. If anything is required, it is necessary to respond promptly and efficiently to any requirements of military medicine. This is my first point. The second point. Of course, it is necessary to quickly and fully resolve all issues of social support for the military in general, but especially for those who were wounded and, first and foremost, for the families of our fallen comrades. This should be done promptly and on full scale. This applies to pay and allowances. The Prime Minister and I have already agreed on some recalculation. Since they are located abroad, they are entitled to corresponding payments. These payments should be increased because everything is tied to the dollar rate in this case and, as we know, the dollar is withering whereas the ruble is growing stronger. This is why all these payments must be recalculated and made accordingly. This applies to all social issues, including housing and so on. In other words, I am asking you to monitor all this. The Defence Ministry is doing this and doing a good job but, naturally, it is necessary to help whenever it needs support. We have many colleagues from the regions here. I know that they are doing much in the regions. Mr Kozhemyako reported to me, I read your note about what is being done and how. I would like to thank you for this and express the hope that regardless of measures taken by the state you will show attention and care for the families of our guys in the regions and will do everything you can to support them. As for social issues in general, as I have already said in the beginning, there are many routine tasks there and you should focus daily on them on the ground, in every region. That said, in addition to this, we should be always looking to the future, a step ahead, and keep focused on the priorities that have already been determined. Our key, unchanging priority is to raise the wellbeing, the living standards of our people. The current year is not easy. Since its beginning, cumulative inflation has exceeded 11 percent. However, when I say this year is ""not easy,"" this does not mean at all that all these difficulties stem from this special military operation because in the countries that are not conducting any operations, for instance, overseas in North America and in Europe, inflation is comparable. If we look at the structure of their economies, we can see that it is even higher than here and in some neighbouring countries, it is several times higher. This is surprising, but it is several times higher. Yet, we are also dealing with it and we must respond to it, although, frankly speaking, I am surprised that inflation is several times lower here than in the countries where nothing like this is happening. I am referring to the special conditions in which we live. But even in these conditions, in early March we set ourselves the task to lower the poverty level by the end of the year. It is clear, and I will say it again, that overall, this situation is typical not only for us but for many other countries in the world today. I am not even talking about separate types of inflation, like in food or energy where their position is so much worse than ours. Still, we must do everything we can to fulfil the task facing us in the current conditions as well. Obviously, this is not an easy task but we must try to carry it out. The effect of this policy is not only social. It also has an economic dimension. The decisions we are adopting support domestic demand and, importantly, this demand is mostly for domestic products. As a result, our economy has a much better dynamic than some experts predicted, which means we will open new production lines and create more jobs. Thankfully, unemployment is not going up and even went down a little, I think. (Addressing Tatyana Golikova.) Ms Golikova, unemployment is now running at 4 percent, isn't it? Frankly, we did not make any forecasts concerning unemployment and assumed that it might even spike, but it is declining instead. We should not take this for granted and focus instead on examining what is going on and helping support this trend. To reiterate, we need to help people in difficult life situations, which we keep an eye on at all times. I would like to discuss some issues separately, including the measures that need to be taken. For example – I discussed this with the Government for quite a while, there were disputes within the Government as it was working on a decision, and I want to announce this now – I propose increasing pensions for non-working pensioners by 10 percent from June 1 with due account taken of our legal regulations. As you are aware, the insurance pensions for non-working pensioners were adjusted by 8.6 percent on January 1. Thus, their pensions will increase by 19.5 percent compared to 2021. This is above the inflation level, which, as experts say, and I already mentioned it, has slowed down to the current 0.175 and will be under 15 percent at the end of 2022, at least, this is our estimate. Second, the subsistence level will increase by 10 percent on June 1 as well and will average 13,919 rubles nationwide. Since some allowances and benefits are derived based on this amount, they will also go up, which will help many families with children. Third, the monthly minimum wage will increase by 10 percent to 15,279 rubles on June 1. What we need to do is to make sure wages grow faster than the cost of living. Our main goal is to further increase the minimum wage so that individual incomes exceed the subsistence level by a wide margin. I suggest discussing today the social contract system in the regions. It was created as a launching pad to help people who find themselves in a difficult situation to start living a decent life again. Let me remind you that since last year, this system has been extended to all regions of the country. I hope to hear regional governors' proposals on improving this mechanism. I would like to note that 52 regions are taking an active part in the events of the National Social Initiative. Colleagues, of course I know that in cooperation with ASI, regional teams analysed the most sensitive cases, went themselves to all the agencies where people turn for help, and drafted plans for changes that many regions are already carrying out. I would like to ask ASI to continue building up work in all socially important areas and be in continuous dialogue with the regional governors. I believe this dialogue is very useful and this cooperation is productive. Another important issue is the functioning of the system of long-term care for people who cannot take care of themselves without outside help due to age or illness. This system has been operating in some regions since 2018 in pilot format. In 2022, we started introducing it in some municipal entities in 34 regions. Last year, over 108,000 people received social care in 24 regions. Out of this number, over 80,000 people received assistance at home or in day centres. I would like to note the important results of this system. Over 9,000 relatives of people requiring care at home have gone back to work. The number of calls for emergency medical assistance by elderly people has gone down significantly. About 4,700 jobs have been created in long-term care. Considering this positive experience, I would like to urge my colleagues to join and expand it, to support it in every way and develop it in this future. Today, I would like to focus on the well-being of families with children, and a dignified standard of living, proper nutrition for children, including at school, which, as you can see for yourself, has a good, I would even say fundamental effect, largely determines a child's development and lays the foundation for health, creativity and success in their independent lives as adults. Statistics show that families with children made up about 80 percent of low-income families in the recent past. It took us several years of system-wide efforts to create a fully integrated low-income family support system. All low-income families now receive monthly allowances for children aged three through 16. In any case, everyone should be receiving them. I hope there are no setbacks in the regions. These measures were taken gradually. The allowances for low-income families with children aged eight to 17 were introduced in April. The first payment was made in May and covered two months. Colleagues, I would like you to tell me how things are with these payments. This is an important matter going forward when we will be building an effective support system for families with children from pregnancy through school. The Government was instructed to create this system a year ago. Well, ""instructed"" is not the right word. We developed these plans and proposals together. I would like to know how this work is proceeding. We must, step by step, fix the shortcomings in the mechanisms for supporting families with children and expectant families. Here is a specific example that concerns female military personnel. This has nothing to do with the operation, it just so happened that female military personnel are not included in the insurance system, and the amount was fixed. They are paid a little over 15,000 rubles in childcare allowance for children under 18 months. As of July 1, this injustice must be dealt with. This amount will be more than doubled to slightly over 31,000 rubles precisely for women who hold this insurance policy. I want the Government to implement this proposal and keep a close eye on this issue. Providing families with housing is a separate issue. As you know, it has been decided to extend for a year – until the end of 2023 – payments of 450,000 rubles for the repayment of mortgage loans for families that had a third child. It is necessary to carry it out. A family with three, four and more children is a mark of status already. It must have this status in our social consciousness and receive support from the state. This is so because for Russia a large family is a historical tradition. We know this well and it has always been like this in Russia. It is necessary to return to this tradition. It is required by our current development and must take root as a norm, a value for society and a major priority for the state. A happy thriving family with many children is a basic response to the demographic challenges we are facing. We are no exception in this respect. You know well that all post-industrial countries are having the same problems. We had a good example of successful work in the beginning and middle of the 2000s. Despite natural setbacks, we must meet this demographic challenge and turn the trend positive without fail. I would like to note that many regions of the Federation have amassed very good experience working with large families. In this context, I would like to ask the State Council Commission on Social Policy to summarise in cooperation with the Agency for Strategic Initiative the best practices of the regions and submit their proposals for their dissemination and introduction at the federal level. Colleagues, at the seminar with Government representatives, you discussed in detail social support measures. Let us summarise them. I will listen to your ideas and proposals with pleasure. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68480,Vladimir Putin introduced new Emergencies Minister Alexander Kurenkov to members of the Ministry's Board,2022-05-25T17:20:00Z,NA,,"During his visit to the National Crisis Management Centre Vladimir Putin introduced Alexander Kurenkov, the new Minister of Civil Defence, Emergencies and Disaster Relief to the Ministry's Board. Earlier, the President signed an executive order appointing Alexander Kurenkov to head the Emergencies Ministry. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, comrades. Today, I would like to introduce to you Alexander Kurenkov, the new Emergencies Minister. Mr Kurenkov started his career as a rank-and-file employee of state security bodies and later worked in the Federal Guards Service for a long time. His latest job was Deputy Director of the National Guard troops. That is deputy minister level. Now he will take one more step, going further in his career. That said, Mr Kurenkov is not a high flyer. On the contrary, he is a campaigner, he knows the job he takes on inside out. He knows how to get to the bottom of it and, being a man of mature age, how to build relations in a team. I am convinced that he will do this at the top of the Emergencies Ministry and the Ministry in general, relying, of course, on professionals. I have no doubt that under his leadership the ministry will continue developing further in accordance with the decisions adopted in 2021: the new development strategy and the Ministry's technical re-equipment plan up to 2030. I hope that all these plans will be carried out. The state allocates significant funding for this purpose – 196 billion rubles. The Ministry needs new aviation, automobile, firefighting and special equipment to be able to fully meet the challenges faced by the country at present. The number of problems is not going down these days. I am not talking now just about floods, man-made disasters and wildfires but also about the situation that is taking shape here in connection with the special military operation. The Ministry has to resolve many problems in this respect. I know you have significant demining capacity. The Ministry is also performing humanitarian missions and functions. All of that is very much sought after, and I have no doubt whatsoever that you will do more than just reach the existing goals that have been on the agenda for a long time now, or the new ones, but will do more as you take on modern challenges and expectations of our people. You and I are well aware that you are the last hope for many people when push comes to shove. I present to you your new leader. I believe that this is the way it will be, and the system will continue to evolve and improve. I want to thank Alexander Chupriyan for his work as deputy minister and then acting minister. It is hard to be at the helm of an agency and not have full authority. Mr Chupriyan is also a very experienced professional. He did well while in office. I want to thank you for this again from the bottom of my heart. I hope that the management will show their best qualities and help the new leader to get up to speed. Everyone is interested in this, primarily, our people, because, to reiterate, often your department is the last hope, and it continues to handle this responsibility honourably to this day. Mr Kurenkov, congratulations and I wish you all the best. Alexander Kurenkov: Thank you for putting your faith in me. Vladimir Putin: Actually, this is all I had to say. Sit down please. Mr Chupriyan, colleagues, if you have any work-related questions, let us discuss them while we are at it. If you think it is better to hold this discussion in the regular course of business, then work with the new leader, and let him know everything he needs to know. Mr Kurenkov, we have not seen each other in a while. Get up to speed and then come see me any time you feel the need. Just let me know and come. Any questions? No? I know we have heads of territorial divisions joining us remotely. I would like to address everyone now. Comrades, you have much to do. The system is working efficiently and professionally. I want to thank you for this and express hope that things will remain like that going forward. We are pinning our hopes on you. Thank you all very much. All the best."

That change marked the emergence of a multilateral pan-African platform on a qualitatively higher level of interaction in the political, socioeconomic and other spheres. African states have achieved a great deal together over the past two decades. They have developed mechanisms for a collective response to local conflicts and crises, and are consistently promoting regional integration processes in various formats. Africa enjoys growing prestige on the global stage and plays an increasingly important role in resolving important issues on the international agenda. Our country has always placed particular emphasis on expanding friendly relations with our African partners. The Russia-Africa Summit held in Sochi in 2019 paved the way for expanding fruitful cooperation, both bilaterally and multilaterally.

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68468,Meeting on transport industry development,2022-05-24T12:45:00Z,Sochi,"Vladimir Putin held a meeting, via videoconference, on the development of certain sectors of Russia's transport industry.","The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Anton Vaino, First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov, deputy prime ministers Viktoria Abramchenko, Alexei Overchuk and Marat Khusnullin, presidential aides Igor Levitin and Maxim Oreshkin, Foreign Minister, Minister of Industry and Trade, Minister of Agriculture, Economic Development Minister, Transport Minister, Finance Minister, Energy Minister, as well as the Central Bank Governor, heads of several regions, the Federal Customs Service and Russian Railways. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues. Today we will discuss current issues of developing Russia's transport industry and outline the key objectives and our further steps in this crucial area. I suggest we also discuss separately the implementation of transport projects in the country's south. We will talk today with our colleagues from Daghestan and the Astrakhan Region, where major transport hubs – the seaports of Makhachkala, Astrakhan and Olya – are being developed. These are very important stops in the North-South transport corridor, which uses the potential of the Volga River and the Caspian Sea. Late last year, instructions were issued to deepen the Volga-Caspian Sea canal to increase traffic and so that the canal would service larger vessels that businesses need. I hope to hear today about the implementation of this project and when concrete results will be achieved. Before we get down to the agenda, I would like to say the following. Infrastructure development is one of the main drivers of our economy, any economy, as a matter of fact. We have been boosting Russia's logistics capability consistently and systematically for many years. We are doing this with an eye on the future and the long-term effect for the Russian business and our people. In the next few years, we need to step up our efforts in this area. We have already increased direct budget expenses on the development of transport infrastructure and created a programme of providing infrastructure budgetary loans. Year after year, we need to boost construction volumes, upgrade the network of roads and railways, river and sea infrastructure, transport arteries that not only connect Russian regions and serve as a base for the development of industry and agriculture, but also help our companies and enterprises to boost foreign trade and enter foreign markets. I have already said, and I would now like to note once again that the Russian economy will certainly remain open in the new conditions. Moreover, we will expand our interaction with countries that are interested in mutually beneficial cooperation. An entire range of issues are of importance here, including the organisation of convenient infrastructure for national currency payments, efforts to streamline science and technological ties and, of course, expanding the capacity of logistics chains, making them more effective and creating new freight traffic routes. This work has become much more strategically important in the past few months. The actions of certain countries and their desire to shut themselves off from Russia, rather than to shut down Russia (even to their own detriment) show that it is highly important to diversify transport flows in the modern world and to expand corridors in the direction of predictable and responsible partners. In this connection, I would like to focus on two principled considerations. They deal with projects in southern Russia, in the Sea of Azov / Black Sea and Caspian Sea basins (we will discuss them today in great detail) and in other high-priority areas. First, as I have already noted, the situation in the global economy and the system of world economic ties is changing rapidly, and all of us can see this. The Russian business community is adapting to these changes, overhauling production and logistics chains and actively establishing new ties with foreign partners. Our plans to develop the transport infrastructure and to eliminate the so-called bottlenecks should also proceed at the same lively pace. I would like federal officials, as well as regional and local colleagues, to hear me. Red tape needs to be scrapped as it is hampering our work and delaying the implementation of transport projects. Failure to meet infrastructure construction deadlines is absolutely unacceptable. On the contrary, as Ihave already said, it is important to speed up the implementation of long overdue construction projects and to draft and launch new transport sector initiatives as soon as possible. For example, we certainly need to make active use of the parallel design and construction mechanism, while, of course, heeding various safety and reliability requirements for unfinished projects. It may become necessary to make additional adjustments to the regulatory framework, the procedure for drafting construction forms and records and regulating construction works. You and I have been discussing this for many years, not just a few months. I am expecting to hear proposals on this matter today. Second. The development of sea and river ports, railways and roads should certainly take into account the real demand for transportation and objective traffic forecasts. But here is what I would like to note in this connection, just to recall. Recently, we had heated discussions on developing the Eastern Operating Domain and the specific parameters of its capacity. Yes, the situation was different then, and there were even some sceptical assessments in this regard, that we could have expanded and invested huge amounts of money – hundreds of billions of rubles for this – to build new routes, but there would have been nothing to transport, since there may not have been cargo traffic. Time showed that these estimates were inaccurate, to say the least. Today, the eastern direction is in great demand and will remain popular for years to come. We can see the same trends on southern routes, where cargo volumes are surging, and the so-called bottlenecks began to appear. I think it is right to abandon the business-as-usual scenario in developing transport infrastructure, when the cargo traffic is estimated based only on current needs, and then, based on these estimates, routes are designed and built. But then there is a lack of capacity. If we act according to such static logic, then we will always be catching up, as the capacity will always be lacking. The infrastructure should be oriented towards the needs of tomorrow, opening up a space of opportunities for business initiatives. And experience shows that as soon as new routes appear, goods to be transported along them also appear. You know, it is true: if a road appears, then life begins around it; if there is no road, there is nothing. In other words, it is infrastructure projects that create new cargo flows. And I would like to emphasise again: this is especially important now, when the situation on global markets is changing dynamically, and trade flows and all global economic activity are shifting from the West to more attractive growing regions. Actually, this has been happening for quite a long time – we all understand this well. It is important to be aware of this perspective, to create new routes and design transport projects with an operating margin meaning that even at the design stage, provisions must be made for optional infrastructure expansion and upgrades so that capacity can be expanded in a short time and at a minimal cost and new supply channels can be opened for Russian manufacturers, exporters and buyers of foreign products. To reiterate, this applies to transport projects across all regions of Russia. I am talking about the development of the Eastern Operating Domain and the Northern Latitudinal Railway, seaports in the Arctic, the Russian Far East, southern and northwestern Russia, including the modernisation of the Murmansk transport hub, and so on. I want you to include this proactive approach to designing and developing the transport infrastructure of ports, roads and railways in the list of instructions following the meeting we had today. Third. On a separate note, I would like to spend a moment discussing border checkpoints. Our colleagues from the business community – you are aware of this – keep complaining about the inordinate amount of time they have to spend clearing cargo and crossing borders, especially at border points with substandard equipment and infrastructure or shortages of specialists, where more efficient cargo handling procedures are needed. It is important to speed up the construction of new border checkpoints and to upgrade the existing ones in order to ensure faster and more business-friendly customs, phytosanitary and other types of control procedures. I would like the relevant agencies to note that this applies not only to land-based checkpoints, but also seaports, which we discussed at a recent meeting on the oil industry. I ask the Prime Minister to take control over these matters. One more important issue in closing. The summer and vacations season, according to the calendar, will be here in a week. Many of our people are planning to go to the beach, to resorts in the Krasnodar Territory or Crimea, some by car, some by rail or air. To date, a number of southern airports are temporarily closed. As a result, there has been more demand for train tickets. I know that Russian Railways has launched additional train services from central Russia to the Black Sea. It is important that during the summer period, passengers are provided with sufficient and reliable services, with no disruption. Judging by what I see, at the moment, there is not yet enough capacity, so I would ask Mr Savelyev and the head of Russian Railways to talk about this. Let us get started. Mr Savelyev, please go ahead. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68460,Meeting with President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko,2022-05-23T14:10:00Z,Sochi,Vladimir Putin met with President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko at the Bocharov Ruchei residence in Sochi.,"Beginning of Russian-Belarusian talks President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Lukashenko, You and I met in Moscow not so long ago and agreed to hold a separate meeting here in Sochi because, indeed, the circumstances call for a serious and profound conversation. I mean everything linked with regional security issues, the security of our countries and also those linked with the economy. Despite all the difficulties, I would like to note that the Russian economy is withstanding the sanctions blow quite well, as evidenced by all the key macroeconomic indicators. I will not list them now, but I will tell you what is going on during our conversation. Yes, of course, things are not so easy, and everything that is happening requires special attention and special efforts from the Government's economic bloc. On the whole, I would like to note that these efforts are having a positive impact. This is reflected in trade volumes between our countries. Last year, we hit an all-time high– almost US$38.5 billion. Incidentally, the conversion to national currency/ ruble payments in trade with our partners is also making itself felt. You have repeatedly noted the need to do this in the past. The situation has objectively developed in a way that we have done this– and in general, this was not detrimental to our partners, as we are meeting all our obligations. We are converting to national currency/ ruble payments in trading in certain commodity categories, and this helps strengthen the ruble. Russia and Belarus see nothing new here, we have been trading in national currencies for a long time, and these volumes are expanding. Of course, another key issue– and everyone is probably expecting me to say'energy'– true, it is important, but industrial cooperation comes first. You have also repeatedly raised the issue of taking additional steps forward here. President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko Lukashenko AlexanderPresident of Belarus: In terms of cooperation. President of Russia Vladimir Putin: In terms of industrial cooperation. Naturally, this involves energy and agriculture as a whole. We have very many spheres of joint work, and we have a lot to discuss. I am not talking about subsequent processes linked with building the Union State. As agreed, we are doing everything calmly, and we are coordinating every step, so that each step will make us and our political systems stronger, both inside and outside, creating a fundamental, proper and solid basis for economic development. I am delighted to see you, welcome. Alexander Lukashenko: Thank you very much. This is not a tribute to fashion. I am really grateful to you for this opportunity to have a dip in the sea and to meet with you and discuss urgent issues. You know, this is a very important point. You noted once that the economy in Russia and in general in our union[the Union State] is not merely getting stronger– unexpectedly, its growth is becoming intensive– take inflation that is less than expected or take unemployment that is going down. Vladimir Putin: Lower than expected. Alexander Lukashenko: This is good. The ruble is getting stronger at a crazy rate. We should not overdo here. Hence, there are many surprises but these are surprises for them. We expected them. This is a time of opportunities. Unaware of this, the Western countries prompted us to work more intensively on our economy. We identified, that is, our governments identified on our instruction, the main import substitution areas. They even calculated very tentatively, what the costs might be. This is not a lot. I do not want to voice these figures in public because they are approximate but they are peanuts. But we will achieve good import substitution in the main areas where we are short of spare parts and so on. I am not even talking about security. We are doing a good job in the sphere of security in terms of producing what our joint army, the army that is operating here needs. So, we should thank them for giving us an impetus to develop our own economy. We have an enormous market and we have resources and technology. And what is happening with them? They have obviously underestimated this. They have been living reading their media and they got inflation and other things.""Putin is to blame,"" they say. They are blaming Putin for everything. Vladimir Putin: We are going to have a serious talk with him. Alexander Lukashenko: Yes.(Laughing.) That's why we are doing well here. We did the right thing when we agreed in Moscow to have a separate meeting to discuss a package of import substitution issues and areas and security. We did not conceal we had things to discuss, especially now that NATO is concentrating its troops on the Western borders. There are some interesting surprises in Ukraine, as you know very well. We are concerned, and I believe you are too, over the steps politicians are already taking to split Ukraine. We are worried that they are prepared– the Poles and NATO– to take away Western Ukraine, as it was before 1939. But we are worried not only over security but also because this is strategy for Western Belarus. Therefore, we are keeping our eyes open, and, as I have already said, the Ukrainians will still have to ask us to prevent the western and other parts of Ukraine from being separated. This is my position but you certainly know it. I know this. Therefore, we have many problems in this context but they are not exactly our problems– they are their problems that we will have to resolve. Take, for example, President Duda's incomprehensible conduct yesterday in Kiev. By the way, he decides practically nothing in Poland but just comes up with these fakes. Therefore, in terms of security we have many problems. You are right here, and I support you. But we will resolve them. We are not afraid of anything. As we used to say in old times, our cause is just and we will win anyway, no matter what. Thank you once again for the opportunity to discuss these issues in more detail and to monitor the fulfilment of the commitments and instructions that we gave to our governments. Vladimir Putin: I am very glad to see you. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68454,Meeting with Sverdlovsk Region Governor Yevgeny Kuyvashev,2022-05-20T18:50:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region",Vladimir Putin held a working meeting with Sverdlovsk Region Governor Yevgeny Kuyvashev via videoconference.,"The President suggested discussing the entire range of issues in the region. He noted that a number of fundamental indicators look good, for instance, maintaining the scale of industrial production, growth in construction and a budget surplus. Financial self-sufficiency is higher and unemployment is lower than the national average. Yet, there are problems that warrant special attention in the future. The Governor reported that economically the region survived the Covid period reasonably well. In the past year, the amount of shipped industrial produce exceeded three trillion rubles, which is 126 percent more than in 2020. In the first quarter of this year, the industrial production index reached 101.3 percent compared to the same period last year. The region's industrial enterprises are implementing a number of large investment projects, including the manufacture of aviation spare parts, construction of a modern wheel-rolling mill and extensive localisation of small aircraft production – single-engine planes and helicopters. The region is developing the Kachkanar deposit and developing rail-and-structural steel production. It will take part in large-scale infrastructure projects of federal importance, such as the extension of the Moscow-Kazan-Yekaterinburg M-12 high-speed motorway. The region continues developing its gas infrastructure. In 2021, the region fully met all of its social commitments and strengthened the labour market. Defence companies are steadily fulfilling the state defence order. The region set a record in housing construction and achieved financial stability. The revenue of the regional budget in 2021 exceeded 359 billion while its expenses amounted to 343 billion rubles. About 70 percent of that is social spending. The region is focused on science and technology. In 2021, the Urals Inter-Regional Research and Education Centre had good results. Last year, the centre received 99 million rubles for its high-technology projects and this year this figure will increase to 101 million rubles. The region's headquarters to monitor the situation and support the industrial complex is working to stabilise the regional economy under sanctions. It has drafted a regional import substitution plan. The Governor also spoke about the region's participation in humanitarian support projects for the people of Donbass and assistance to the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics. Over 390 tonnes of humanitarian cargo have been collected and shipped there. The Governor said that the World Student Games was the largest socially significant ongoing project in sports and construction. The work on developing the necessary infrastructure is on schedule. Yevgeny Kuyvashev also noted that his term in office as Sverdlovsk Region Governor expires this year, and the President's plans regarding his future employment are critically important to him. Vladimir Putin noted that he already listed the fundamental accomplishments achieved by the Governor and his team, which create a good foundation for the continued progress of the region, and said that he hoped that Governor Kuyvashev would keep up the good work. However, the President noted some challenges such as a decline in agricultural output. Governor Kuyvashev said half of the region's agricultural land had been impacted by a major drought last year. A number of reclamation measures were taken this year. Even if the weather remains unchanged this year, the region hopes to do better than last year. This year, the region is meeting almost 98 percent of its demand in potatoes, eggs, pork, poultry and vegetables with its own resources. Vladimir Putin underscored that the environment is one of the most pressing problems. There are related Government programmes, and the Governor must keep this matter under his constant supervision. The President also said that motor vehicles adversely affect the environment, not only in the Sverdlovsk Region, so the Governor is doing the right thing planning to buy more trolleybuses, but the region must co-finance the effort. President Putin suggested working this issue through with the Government. With regard to Governor Kuyvashev's suggestion to build a children's multidisciplinary hospital in Nizhny Tagil, the President promised to make the Governor's letter available to the Government for further consideration. The President said he was aware of other public health issues as well. All the Governor's requests to that effect will also be submitted to the Government."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68453,Meeting with Kaliningrad Region Governor Anton Alikhanov,2022-05-20T18:10:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region","The President held a working meeting with Kaliningrad Region Governor Anton Alikhanov, via videoconference.","Vladimir Putin began the conversation by noting that gross regional product, agricultural production, retail trade and permanent population in the region were all growing. At the same time, unemployment is a bit lower than the national average and the region is doing fairly well on housing and utilities. However, problems remain, and this is where the President directed the discussion. Anton Alikhanov reported that in the last few years, the Kaliningrad Region has created conditions for accelerated industrial and agricultural development and increased revenues for the region owing to the President's support and the laws passed to create a special economic zone and a special administrative district there. In the past five years, its GRP grew by 12 percent, investment in processing industries was nearly 33.5 billion rubles and about 22,000 jobs were created at large and medium-size enterprises. In cooperation with large energy companies, the Rosatom State Corporation and Hevel Group, the region is implementing two major innovative projects in new energy, as it is called. This includes an industrial complex to manufacture solar energy equipment, and the production of lithium-ion batteries. Small businesses account for a third of the economy and the dynamics here are positive. The number of people employed by small businesses went up by 11 percent or 220,000 people in the past year. In the past five years, the region increased cropland by 20 percent and invested about 32 billion rubles in livestock production. It created a unique genetic selection centre for dairy cattle breeding and is now supplying other regions of Russia with its genetic products. In the next few years, similar complexes will be established in poultry and pig farming with a view to ending dependence on imports. The Governor said that the region's own consolidated budget revenues have increased by 73 percent compared to 2017. It is building schools, kindergartens, hospitals and outpatient clinics. Last year, it opened 1,300 square metres of housing. The region continues building cultural and educational centres on Oktyabrsky Island. The President and the Governor also discussed the situation in the construction industry and the building of gas infrastructure. The President noted that only half of the coastal fishing quotas were being used and asked for clarification. The Governor confirmed that this was a problem and said that a special regional programme had been adopted to speed up the construction of new vessels. The regional budget mostly covers the construction of small-sized vessels that are used in coastal fishing. The regional authorities hope that this will make it possible to regain high volumes of coastal catches of sprat, Baltic herring and other species. The President suggested joining the federal programme for the construction of fishing vessels of various classes. This work, he said, was underway in many regions, including European Russia and the Far Eastern Federal District, so efforts must be made to join in. Vladimir Putin also asked a question about the road and rail complex on Vostochny Peninsula. This issue was mentioned in one of the letters submitted by the Governor. Anton Alikhanov explained that this concerned the Ust-Luga-Baltiysk railway ferry service, where four ferries are already operational. The maximum capacity on this rail ferry service is five ferries. Another ferry is being built at the instruction of the President and will be in service in the third quarter, which will top off the rail ferry service's capacity. Considering the potential for negative or aggressive actions on the part of the Kaliningrad Region's neighbours or attempts to block transit through their territory, the Governor said it was necessary to expand the railway ferry crossing's capacity so that the region can function even in case transit across Lithuania is cut off completely. The Governor asked the President to issue a directive to this effect. Another request by the Governor concerned Baltic Fleet servicemen and their families not getting refunds for air tickets to vacation destinations and back home. Their only option is to travel by air, which represents a financial strain for many of them. Anton Alikhanov asked the President to look into the possibility of granting the military who serve under contract in the region and their families the right to travel free of charge to vacation spots and back home noting that this is practiced in the Northern Fleet and the Pacific Fleet. The President agreed that this matter must be resolved. Vladimir Putin noted all the good work done in the region, thanked the Governor for his efforts, and wished him every success in the future."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68451,Security Council meeting,2022-05-20T15:50:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region",Vladimir Putin chaired a meeting of the Russian Federation Security Council via videoconference. The meeting agenda included ways to improve the security and stability of the state's information infrastructure.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues. Today we will discuss issues pertaining to protecting and ensuring the reliable operation of our information systems and communications networks, as well as measures to counter external threats in this area. This is a complicated topic that is, of course, extremely relevant. Everybody understands that. It is of primary importance for our sovereignty and security, for the economy, governance and public stability. The number of cyberattacks on Russian information infrastructure has been growing in the past years. For several years. But since the special military operation in Donbass and Ukraine, challenges in this sphere have become even more serious and critical. Russia has essentially become the target of aggression, of an information war. The number of cyberattacks, including complex attacks, has multiplied. Experts believe it would not be possible for lone hackers to achieve that. The hackers attack from different countries in a well-coordinated effort. These attacks are conducted by state-run structures, and we know that the armies of some countries officially include cyber troops. Targeted attempts to disable online resources of critical information infrastructure in Russia have been detected. Media outlets, financial institutions and widely used public websites and networks have been hit the hardest. Official government websites have been subjected to serious attacks. Attempts to hack into corporate networks of major Russian companies are detected substantially more often. The following tactic was used in the majority of cases: access to Russian websites is blocked and information becomes unavailable or is replaced with false information. The latest algorithms and combined technology are employed. Increasingly more advanced software is used that is able to damage devices running on different operating systems. I will point out another serious challenge. One of the tools of sanctions' pressure on Russia involved restrictions on foreign IT products and software. A number of Western tech companies unilaterally cut off Russia from technical support services for their equipment. Incidents where their products became limited or blocked have become more frequent. All this should be taken into account when Russian companies and public authorities introduce new foreign IT products or use previously installed ones. Even today, it can be said that the cyber aggression against us has failed, as well as the entire sanctions attack on Russia. We have been generally ready for this attack, as a result of the systematic work we have been doing in recent years. Our specialists have been making dedicated efforts to protect the information infrastructure, ensuring the stable operation and security of networks and communication channels, and, I repeat, we have managed to do a lot, including the creation of our own unique technologies. This effort was properly regulated, administratively and legally, as strategic planning documents were adopted, which identified the main threats and risks in this area and specific steps to neutralise them. As I have already noted, with the legal framework significantly strengthened, the protection of information at state bodies and critical infrastructure facilities became far more effective. However, the nature of challenges and threats is changing fast. The entire information sphere is showing rapid growth. We certainly need to be mindful of this and keep all these matters under constant scrutiny and review. Presidential Executive Order No. 250 signed on May 1 stipulates new parameters and requirements for such work. To follow up on that, today we will discuss the draft Basic Principles of State Policy on Ensuring the Security of Russia's Critical Information Infrastructure. What should we focus our attention on? First of all, we must work very seriously, constantly and in real time to improve and fine-tune the information security mechanisms of the crucial sector-specific facilities, on which the defence capability and stable economic and social development of our country depend. I would like to point out that to date, a third of such facilities have no information security departments, although it has been said more than once that such departments must be established as soon as possible and that they should include professionals who have a good knowledge of the given sector's specifics. Furthermore, the coordination of all information security departments' activities at the critical facilities must be ensured at the strategic level, and the heads of these organisations shall be held personally responsible for this, as per Executive Order No. 250, which I have mentioned. The second task is to reinforce the protection of the information and communication systems of government agencies. The inspections held in 2021 showed that the majority of these agencies' resources are vulnerable to large-scale attacks and to destructive external influence, especially those that are still using the last generation of foreign technologies. We must strengthen the protection of the national digital space; there must be no weak spots here. It is essential to neutralise the risk of breaches of confidential information and personal data, including through stricter control of the use of office equipment, infrastructure and communications. Given all this, I think it makes sense to discuss establishing a state information security system. I would like you to submit concrete proposals on the additional measures we must take to ensure the stable work of the information infrastructure of our government agencies and institutions. The third priority is to dramatically reduce the risks associated with the use of foreign-made software, computer technology and telecommunication equipment. I would like to stress once again that the ongoing extensive digitalisation in the Russian public administration system and economy (we launched this process several years ago) should be protected as much as possible from any potential negative external impact. The obvious way to achieve this goal is to shift to domestically developed equipment, technology, software and products. Allow me to remind you that, according to the recently adopted decisions, using foreign means of information security will be completely prohibited as of 2025. Therefore, to strengthen our technological sovereignty, the Government needs to create a modern Russian base of electronic components within the shortest term possible. We have been discussing this for a long time now and we are working on it diligently. I hope we will see the results very soon. Our job is to develop and implement our own technological equipment, including the equipment required for developing hardware and software systems. Tools and resources of the Digital Economy National Programme can be widely used here. I would like to hear your opinion not only on how we can stimulate import substitution in this essential industry but also on how we can develop our own unique products that would be highly competitive. Another measure is supporting our domestic ICT developers. I am confident that overall, it is important to improve coordination between all competent government agencies and organisations. We have already made some progress by establishing a national crisis response centre to prevent targeted cyber-attacks. Every federal district has an information security commission chaired by a presidential plenipotentiary envoy. The most important thing is to make all these efforts logical and consistent, to connect the work of all information security stakeholders based on the peculiarities of particular industries and regions. Now let us begin with reports. I would like to give the floor to Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev. Please. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68446,Meeting with Rosatom CEO Alexei Likhachev,2022-05-19T15:50:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region",Director General of the State Atomic Energy Corporation Rosatom Alexei Likhachev briefed the President on the corporation's performance.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Likhachev, This year, in December it will be 15 years since the signing of the law on the establishment of the Rosatom corporation. A great deal of work has been accomplished over this period. Director General of the State Atomic Energy Corporation Rosatom Alexei Likhachev Likhachev AlexeiDirector General of State Atomic Energy Corporation Rosatom : Yes. The date of the establishment of the corporation is very memorable to us. Actually, the industry is in its 77th year. We are the same age as the Great Victory albeit the formation of the state corporation signified a completely new stage in the development of the industry. In fact, a group of companies acquired a uniform mechanism of management with common economic indicators and a unique corporate culture. Nuclear competences were unified – from producing uranium to building and operating nuclear power plants. Of course, new divisions were built from scratch: machine-building, logistics, digital and many others. As for the corporation's performance indicators over these 15 years, it made what can only be described as a ""quantum leap"": its revenue has grown 4.5 times over, labour productivity is five times higher than it was and annual investment is 15 times more than before. The latter is particularly remarkable. We are actively developing science and research and the number of patents has increased 13 times over every year. Over the past five years, we have actively developed new products and entered the world market. Our revenue from new products has actually doubled and our foreign proceeds rose by 50 percent. Vladimir Putin: The main task is to increase labour productivity. Alexei Likhachev: We are developing labour productivity at priority rates. It is growing faster than wages and salaries, which is very important. Our digital revenues have gone up a hundred times. This is, of course, because of a low starting point. We will certainly continue to develop further. We have set many records over the last year. Given the full implementation of the state defence order, our revenues reached 1.5 trillion, and this is only the open part. Naturally, our proceeds are much more. Another record is 222 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. We put new units into operation – the second Leningrad and the first Belarusian units. The company also set a record in terms of shipments along the Northern Sea Route – almost 35 million tonnes. We are fulfilling the decisions approved at the meeting on the Northern Sea Route that you chaired. Under the guidance of the Government, we have made progress in the construction of nuclear-powered icebreakers, of an ATO [atomic technological maintenance] ship, in creating an integrated navigation management system for the Northern Sea Route. I hope we will be able to launch this system very soon. We have recorded some serious growth in the first quarter: we generated 2 percent more electricity; proceeds from selling new products are up 26 percent, and up 13 percent for foreign ones. On the other hand, we understand that we have been living and working under new conditions over the past few months, and that this will continue. I would therefore like to focus on several things. Vladimir Putin: Please. Alexei Likhachev: Regarding our international projects, we continue to implement all of them, and everything is proceeding according to plan so far. We see some risks with certain projects, and we are drafting the relevant compensatory measures. I believe we will successfully complete the majority of these projects. In the past few years, we have been ranked second in terms of global uranium production. We confidently lead the way in terms of enrichment and conversion, and we consistently rank among the three largest fuel manufacturers. We have drafted long-term development projects in all areas. We continue to cooperate with the IAEA, and we are involved in the ambitious International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project in France. I want to say once again that the international nuclear community is not yet cutting ties in this sphere, and that this cooperation continues. Regarding the domestic agenda, apart from state defence contracts, the nuclear power industry remains our top priority. We have built 11 units in ten years; nuclear power plants generate 20 percent of all electricity nationwide. You have instructed us to increase this share to 25 percent, and we will have to build 16 more innovative units, through to 2035, to achieve this goal. The Government has approved a general plan, so we understand what facilities we should build and where. I would also like to thank you on behalf of the industry for signing, on April 14, the executive order extending our national project until 2030. This is indeed a very serious decision that will create a fourth-generation technological platform for nuclear energy, and most importantly, will give us the opportunity to build a major facility on earth. I am referring to the Proryv (Breakthrough) project in Seversk, a multi-purpose fast research reactor facility, a Tokamak thermonuclear device with reactor technologies, a prototype of tomorrow's thermonuclear reaction, a number of experimental reactors, and of course our cooperation with Roscosmos, including new rocket engines for near space, and for deep space. All of the above will be included in the extended national project. Importantly, 95 percent of Russian nuclear power plants are made in Russia, as they say, and the remaining five percent are not critical. We see what's critical. Electrical engineering, electronics, certain types of diesel equipment, some types of pumping equipment each account for about a half a percent of its value. Actually, we are already creating import substitution alliances with businesses. So my first point is Russian nuclear technology is import-independent. And we don't see any problems here. Second, we will be placing at least one trillion rubles worth of orders outside the industry for implementing our national project every year. This is certainly a very important growth vector for Russian engineering as well as the economy as a whole. But large orders are not all; the nuclear industry has always been known for its advanced technologies and innovation. Vladimir Putin: Exactly. Alexei Likhachev: I remember well how in Soviet times, even with the Iron Curtain, mathematical modelling was advancing, and security system projects, too – that gave an impetus to the creation of an entire programme of new products. I was actually surprised to find out that, over the past year, we have met the demand of more than 2,600 Russian companies and enterprises for high-tech products, that is, Russian industry is already returning our efforts as new innovative orders and projects. I would like to share with you the ideas that I consider most important. If you recall, at the same meeting on the Arctic, NOVATEK executives raised the issue of LNG equipment. We built Europe's first test stand at Yefremov NIIEFA in St Petersburg. We designed and implemented a technical solution for cryogenic heat exchangers. This is the basis of any liquefying technology. We have learned to produce medium-scale facilities. I believe we will learn to make large-scale facilities as well. We are receiving many inquiries from the oil-and-gas industry both as regards specific equipment and in general about new approaches to technology, including the production of difficult-to-access hydrocarbons. We are working on this and maintain exemplary cooperation with Gazprom Neft. We have fully closed the chain in composites and are converting to the production of specific and quite modern medical equipment. Vladimir Putin: You helped many companies with composites at once. Alexei Likhachev: Yes. We are moving forward in digital development and creating alliances with companies, small companies, private companies, majors like Rostec and Russian Railways. We will fulfil your instructions two years ahead of schedule: in 2023, software purchases for critical infrastructure will reach 100 percent. We will do this and in general, we are transferring it to Russian software at a faster pace. We have made progress in quantum technology. We have worked on this for two years. According to expert analysis, we have actually cut the lag time behind our foreign partners' – our rivals in some cases – developments in half. But in reality, we are now in the top three for some technologies. There is an opinion that a separate type of quanta – qudits – are the best for these processors. Like the United States and Austria, we have now developed a prototype of a quantum processor. Incidentally, we were the first to develop software for this quantum algorithm in the interests of the atomic industry. I would be remiss if I don't mention the environmental project, which also represents a series of your instructions. An industrial waste control system for I and II hazard class wastes has been launched with over 25,000 users. Seven waste treatment plants are being built across the Russian Federation, and I am certain that we will bring things up to code in this area. Also, we are dealing with heritage. Last September, in Chelyabinsk, we finished working on the household waste dump. In Krasny Bor, we started the actual work. We have completed the necessary priority work in Usolye-Sibirskoye and at the Baikal Pulp and Paper Mill. Vladimir Putin: What did you do in Usolye-Sibirskoye? Alexei Likhachev: We completely tore down the mercury electrolysis shop and cleaned up the area. We started working with the oil lens where there was a risk of waste going straight into the Angara River. We have fully completed the project design in order to begin full-scale system-wide liquidation this year. There were scores of extremely dangerous wells, and no one knew what was stored there or how much. So, neutralising and blocking them were among our priorities as well. In closing, I would like to say a few words about the team. Indeed, we are more than a technology leader or a global nuclear industry leader. We are a unique team with our own traditions. We are first in employer rankings. Full involvement and employees' willingness to devote themselves to their work is an important indicator and stands at 84 percent, a level that exceeds top international indicators. I would like to add that this number went up in recent weeks. That is, our employees have rolled up their sleeves and got down to work seeing this as their contribution to fulfilling the country's immediate goals. Vladimir Putin: Rosatom is definitely among our technology leaders. I hope this trend continues. We talked about materials. You have helped many industries, from aircraft manufacturing to medicine. Alexei Likhachev: Mr President, machine building is our main focus. We have reinforced our machine-building capacities, and we have many orders. One more thought. The more pressure they put on us, the more work we have, and the more the team is mobilised. <…>"

It is important that Russia prioritises efforts to strengthen the aviation sector's significant potential. The air ambulance service continues to develop actively under the national project Healthcare. We upgrade helicopters that have won a reputation for themselves, and we design new advanced models, including the innovative Mi-171AZ helicopter that has been developed for offshore operations and for servicing offshore drilling platforms and the Ka-32A11M fire-fighting helicopter. These achievements were made possible by the creative and constructive work of people at research and development centres, specialised industrial enterprises, teams of designers and engineers who addressed their tasks in a responsible manner."""

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68443,Greetings to participants and organisers of events marking 1100th anniversary of adoption of Islam by Volga Bulgaria,2022-05-19T10:20:00Z,NA,Vladimir Putin sent greetings to the participants and organisers of events marking the 1100th anniversary of the adoption of Islam by Volga Bulgaria.,"The message reads, in part:""I offer you my heartfelt greetings and congratulations on the 1100th anniversary of the adoption of Islam by Volga Bulgaria, which is an important event for the Muslim ummah of Russia and the world, and, of course, for our entire country. We are sincerely happy that guests from dozens of countries– politicians, religious and public figures, scientists, artists and journalists– have come to the Republic of Tatarstan to attend the celebrations. The adoption of Islam by Volga Bulgaria was a landmark event in the history of our Motherland. It influenced its establishment as a multiconfessional country and played an important role in the formation of a united and strong-knit people of Russia. For centuries, Russian Muslims have made a significant contribution to the development of the country. Their great achievements in various areas are an inseparable part of our rich historical, scientific, cultural and spiritual heritage. The current generation of Muslims in Russia treats the traditions and customs of their ancestors with respect and adheres to their firm commitment to honest service to the Fatherland, high ideals of patriotism and justice. During the special military operation in Ukraine, Muslim soldiers have shown fortitude, courage and dedication. It is important that Russian Muslims actively participate in expanding the country's international ties. The current events, especially the 13th International Economic Summit Russia– Islamic World: KazanSummit 2022, and a regular meeting of the Russia– Islamic World Strategic Vision Group are the proof of that. We set a high value on strengthening the friendly ties with Muslim countries, both bilateral relations and within the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. We coordinate our efforts in dealing with many important issues on the regional and global agenda, and together stand against the use of blackmail, discriminative measures, and political and economic dictate in international relations. We count on the further boosting of mutually beneficial, productive cooperation in trade, economy, science and technology, culture and other areas. I am confident that the meetings held during the celebrations will facilitate a free exchange of opinions and the launch of promising and useful new initiatives."""
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68438,Greetings to participants in the 30th Russian Student Spring Festival,2022-05-18T21:45:00Z,NA,Vladimir Putin sent greetings in a video address to participants in the 30th Russian Student Spring Festival underway in Samara.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, I welcome you and congratulate you on the opening of the 30th Russian Student Spring Festival. The first festivals were held here, in Samara. And of course, it is symbolic that today this wonderful hospitable Volga city, with its unique diversity of national traditions, has once again brought together young people from all regions of our country, as well as from the CIS countries and, I would like to point out, from the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics. The Student Spring is not just a vibrant cultural event, but a huge space of young, creative energy, where everyone can discover new horizons and achieve success, thanks to their talents and skills in music, choreography, acting and other areas. For many, this festival, held under the auspices of the Russian Youth Union, launches their professional career on stage or in art, and, no less important, helps them to find like-minded people, mentors, true friends, and therefore reliable support in all future endeavours, regardless of which profession they will ultimately prefer. Let me note that the Student Spring also includes numerous regional festivals, in which over 300,000 people participate annually. In 2019, it was the first creative project to become part of the Russia– Land of Opportunity platform. And now all its participants have even broader opportunities for self-realisation. The festival's rich programme and tours of the competition winners unite young people based on deep interest in the multifaceted national culture, including the creative heritage of the peoples of Russia. And thus they help to preserve and promote the richest cultural traditions of our multi-ethnic state and contribute to strengthening the unity of the country, which is extremely important for its further development. In today's very dynamic world, deep knowledge, the desire to study constantly, and the ability to work in a team play a huge role for a student, a future professional. But in order to fully reveal your best qualities, you should be ready to serve people, society and your native country, show patriotism, responsible civic engagement, and get involved in the affairs of your region, city or village. In a word, it is important to feel and share the values that underpin our society. I am convinced that you, talented and dedicated young people, are going to build your life this way. I want to wish you success in your studies, in all your endeavours and, of course, a creative spring mood. I am sure that the 30th Student Spring Festival will become a bright and unforgettable event for all its participants and guests. All the best to you!"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68437,Meeting Rostec CEO Sergei Chemezov,2022-05-18T13:45:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",CEO of Rostec State Corporation Sergei Chemezov reported to the President on the corporation's performance in 2021.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Chemezov, Rostec is our largest corporation in the defence industry. This is your annual report? CEO of Rostec State Corporation Sergei Chemezov Chemezov SergeiCEO of Rostec State Corporation: Yes, this is our annual report. The Environment to Develop the New is the topic of our annual report. A lot has been done over 2021. Our consolidated revenue grew by almost 10 percent and amounted to 2.06 trillion rubles. We have crossed the important psychological milestone of two trillion. We have been trying to achieve this for a long time and, finally, last year we surpassed this barrier, this milestone. Our consolidated net profit increased by almost 47 percent and constituted 163.5 billion rubles. EBITDA increased by 18 percent to 335 billion. The total market value of our assets is a new indicator that we introduced last year. It is 980.5 billion rubles, which is 50 percent higher than in 2020; this means that the value of our assets is constantly growing. The share of civilian products in the consolidated net profit amounted to 45.5 percent. Vladimir Putin: Good. Sergei Chemezov: Yes. You have set us the task of reaching 50 percent by 2030. We set ourselves this task for 2025, but last year the share of civilian products was already 45.5 percent. This, of course, has happened for the most part thanks to KAMAZ. We have such enterprises that produce quite a large volume of civilian products: KAMAZ and Russian Helicopters. The UAC[United Aircraft Corporation] has begun to produce civil aircraft in large quantities: not large enough yet, but we are striving towards this. Vladimir Putin: Now you have a chance to conquer the domestic market. Sergei Chemezov: That is right, of course. Last year and the year before that our pharmaceutical holding, Natsimbio[National Immunobiological Company], did a great deal of work. We supplied our customers all across Russia with over 100 million sets of all kinds of vaccines: from the coronavirus to flu, and various other diseases. We manufacture most vaccines ourselves. The financial results that we have achieved made it possible to increase the volume of investment by 18 percent, which amounts to 242 billion rubles today. Thus, at the end of 2021, the corporation achieved all the goals that we had set for ourselves. I would like to discuss some of the recent events at our corporation. Rostec has implemented 72 equipment modernisation projects– primarily it has upgraded its aircraft engineering facilities that manufacture helicopters and planes, as well as aircraft engines, because this is our top priority business right now. We have re-equipped our optics arm, introducing new technological solutions and fully retrofitting our optical devices plants in Vologda and Novosibirsk. Vladimir Putin: Modernisation. Sergei Chemezov: Yes. In-depth modernisation. We have embraced and introduced 57 innovative technologies at our facilities, including for manufacturing aircraft engine parts using laser metal deposition, and innovative glass for the cabin of the new Russian-made cruise liner we are making, Peter the Great. It will sail the Volga and the sea, a river-sea class ship. And there is a service for urban management. We have completed the development of 233 innovative products, including the MC-21–300 aircraft with wings made of a Russian composite material, and the Okhotnik UCAV. I will tell you more about these projects later. The next project was a total redesign of the Tu-160M missile carrier with the new NK-32 engine. We have actually created a totally new aircraft. It looks like the previous model on the outside, but in fact, everything is new, including its engine and on-board equipment set– all the units have been replaced. All the documentation has been digitized; the last such aircraft was manufactured at the Kazan plant back in the 1980s. We have 834 patents and 474 know-how certificates. Our total R&D investment reached 170 billion rubles. What products did we create last year? First of all, it is the Checkmate light tactical fighter. Why did we choose an English name for it? Because it was designed mostly for export. We have invested our own capital in this aircraft without attracting budgetary funds. We hope the Defence Ministry will eventually decide to buy it as well. I believe that it will be a very good plane. It is a fifth-generation light aircraft. We first unveiled it during the MAKS air show last year. It is a multipurpose new-generation platform, which can effectively rival other fifth-generation aircraft in long- and short-range combat. Vladimir Putin: It is a light aircraft, right? Sergei Chemezov: Yes, it is a light single-engine aircraft. It is powered by a modified engine we previously used for the Su-57 fifth-generation plane. We are working now on the design documentation and have created a new model. Vladimir Putin: I saw it. Sergei Chemezov: Yes, we showed it. We plan to start batch production in 2027. The PD-14 engine is already operational. Vladimir Putin: Very good. Sergei Chemezov: We have certified it. Its batch production will begin in 2023. Next year, we will also hold the certification tests of our composite wing and engine. Vladimir Putin: On the MC-21? Sergei Chemezov: Yes, on the MC-21. We will manufacture the first six planes in 2024. Next, the Okhotnik UCAV. Its distinguishing feature is a flat jet nozzle. This new technical solution has made it less visible to radar. In addition, we are creating a new ground-based control system for this drone. The first flight vehicle was rolled out in 2021. We will start its batch production in 2023 and will deliver it to the Defence Ministry. The first Mi-171A3 offshore helicopter was also unveiled at the MAKS air show last year, when it made its maiden flight. It is designed for offshore operations and for servicing offshore drilling platforms. Our clients are our gas and oil companies. Its batch production will begin in 2023. It is undergoing certification tests now. The first helicopters are scheduled to be delivered in early 2024. We have created a new M55R diesel gas-turbine power unit, which will be mounted on our frigates. It is the first Russian-made engine of this type. We are already starting its batch production. We have done a lot in the field of healthcare; we were spurred on by COVID as well. In this regard, we have increased the share of civilian products. In particular, we created the Diathera magnetotherapy device. It is designed for the treatment and prevention of eye diseases. It treats myopia, hyperopia and computer vision syndrome, which has become very common among young people because they spend all day at the computer. This device does not require any special medical training: you can be treated at home or in any outpatient clinic. We have started producing it and it is already on sale. It was included in last year's Russia's 100 Best Goods rating. It is a very interesting device. COVID-Globulin. This drug is created from the blood plasma of people who have recovered from COVID and already have antibodies. It was used extensively to treat patients last year. It has been very helpful and is in high demand. Aventa-Vita is a portable lung ventilator. It can be used in the ambulance, in air ambulance helicopters, in air ambulance planes, and also at home. By the end of this year, we shall start producing and selling it. The SLE 6000 neonatal lung ventilator is a new version of lung ventilator to keep new-borns breathing. It differs from its predecessors in that it can prevent air retention in the lungs and has the capacity to automatically control saturation. The oxygen concentrator, Oxyplus, is a very interesting device. It produces oxygen from the air. It produces, purifies and decontaminates it, and then delivers a sterile stream directly to the patient. You can use a lung ventilator with this machine anywhere, in any room, in any hospital, and it does not have to be supplied with special gases. Vladimir Putin: How long did it take to set that all up? Sergei Chemezov: Eighteen to twenty-four months. We started working on it as soon as the COVID started. Vladimir Putin: So basically, import substitution for the products which are now difficult to import could be achieved in eighteen to twenty-four months? Sergei Chemezov: Of course. We will start batch production of these machines, oxygen concentrators, in 2022. Vladimir Putin: Good. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68434,Meeting on oil industry development,2022-05-17T16:00:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",The President held a meeting on oil industry development via videoconference.,"Attending the meeting were Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Anton Vaino, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, Presidential Aide Maxim Oreshkin, Minister of Economic Development Maxim Reshetnikov, Minister of Transport Vitaly Savelyev, Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov, Minister of Energy Nikolai Shulginov, Central Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina, representatives of Surgutneftegaz, Gazprom Neft, Zarubezhneft, Rosneft, Lukoil, Transneft, Sovcomflot and State Development Corporation VEB.RF *** President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues, Today, we will discuss the situation in the oil industry as part of our regular meetings on economic issues. For Russia, with its huge hydrocarbon reserves, this industry, as well as the fuel-and-energy complex as a whole, has been and remains one of the leading components of the national economy. It is playing a tangible role in meeting the requirements of the domestic market, and, of course, in using the country's export potential. What would I like to say in this connection? All these years, in all previous years, we have paid special attention to this industry. We were actively developing new deposits, increasing production and upgrading the quality of oil refining. We were introducing innovations, digital, eco-friendly technology and services on a broad scale. Stable, reliable supplies of Russian oil to foreign customers served as a guarantee of Russia's future leading positions in global energy supplies. Naturally, the Government and the authorities at all other levels, including the regions, always supported you. Unfortunately, our colleagues in the Western countries behaved in a quite different manner. Both you and representatives of the energy sector in other countries know and understand all this perfectly well. In effect, the so-called political class in the West began to exploit the completely natural concern of many people in the world over climate and climate change problems. It is perfectly obvious that, for internal political reasons, the so-called political class in the West started overrating the potentialities of alternative energy and underrating the importance of all traditional energy sources, including hydrocarbons. This continuous abuse was of quite specific nature. I want to repeat, and you know this better than anyone else: there were restrictions in bank financing, contrived lawsuits were and probably are still initiated against companies and their management, land plots necessary for new projects are not being allocated, the development of various kinds of transport is being hindered, and problems are created in freight shipping and other areas necessary for providing timely and sufficient investment in the sector. All of this underlies the problems that arise in the global energy industry, primarily with oil and gas. Naturally and very obviously, there are also political considerations. By the way, everything that happens in this area, including, unfortunately, everything around Ukraine, is related to the ill-considered policy of the so-called collective West, which for decades ignored Russia's justified security concerns, and in every possible way fostered nationalist and neo-Nazi elements in the Kiev leadership, neglected problems that were taking shape in Ukraine's southeast, and, in fact, for the past eight years facilitated the ongoing hostilities that were launched by the Kiev regime eight years ago. Today, we see that for purely political reasons, driven by their own ambitions, and under pressure from their US overlord, the European countries are imposing more sanctions on the oil and gas markets which will lead to more inflation. Instead of admitting their mistakes, they are looking for a guilty party elsewhere. Indeed, the Europeans openly admit they are unable to fully go without Russian energy resources at this point. It is also clear that some EU countries with a particularly high share of Russian hydrocarbons in their energy balance will not be able to do without Russian energy for a long time going forward. However, they have set this goal for themselves oblivious to the damage they are doing to their respective economies. One gets the impression that Western politicians and economists simply forget basic economic laws or just choose to ignore them. What are they trying to accomplish with these decisions? First, the sanctions imposed by our European colleagues and the declarations on refusing to use any Russian energy in the future have sent spot market oil prices higher. You are aware of this. One ill-considered word at the political level is instantly reflected on the market. Second, the prices for petroleum products on the European market, such as diesel fuel, are growing even faster than oil prices due to actual shortages. This energy inflation – they are trying to blame us for energy inflation, put our names on it, and blame everything on Russia in an attempt to cover up, as I said, their own blunders in this sphere. Already today, this is impacting European transport and industry generally, and is falling heavily on the shoulders of millions of European consumers. Finally, third and most important, saying no to Russian energy means that Europe will systemically and for the long term become the world's most costly region for energy resources. Yes, prices will rise, and resources will go to counter these price hikes, but this will not change the situation significantly. Some analysts are saying that it will seriously or even irrevocably undermine the competitiveness of a significant portion of European industry, which is already losing ground to companies from other parts of the world. Now, these processes will certainly pick up pace. Clearly, the opportunities for economic activity, with its improvements, will leave Europe for other regions, as will Russia's energy resources. This economic auto-da-fe… suicide is, of course, the internal affair of the European countries. But in the meantime, we need to act pragmatically, proceeding primarily from our own economic interests. Now our partners' erratic actions – this is what they are – have resulted in a de facto growth in revenue in the Russian oil-and-gas sector in addition to the damage to the European economy. We should certainly bear this in mind; we understand and see it but it should not unbrace our companies. The changes in the oil market are tectonic and, of course, business is unlikely to follow old patterns. Under these new conditions, it is important not only to produce oil but also to build an entire vertical chain, all the way to the end consumer. Colleagues, under the circumstances the state will continue doing all it can to create conditions for changing the business models of companies – improve logistics opportunities and ensure transactions in national currencies – I realise there are certain restrictions in this respect, as we have discussed many times, but it is necessary to work for this, and that's what we will do. We will make loans and insurance services more affordable for oil companies and encourage projects on the advanced processing of raw materials and upgrading domestic oil services technology, including the development of deposits and extraction. At the April 14 meeting, we reviewed in detail the change in priorities in developing the oil-and-gas industry. We made strategic decisions to protect the long-term interests of the Russian economy. Understanding what steps the West will take in the near future, we must reach conclusions in advance and be proactive, turning the thoughtless chaotic steps of some of our partners to our advantage for the benefit of our country. Naturally, we should not hope for their endless mistakes. We should simply, practically proceed from current realities, as I said. In this connection, I would like to discuss a plan for additional measures that will allow us to protect our national interests as much as possible, and strengthen our economic sovereignty, in this case in the fuel-and-energy sector, primarily the oil industry. Let's analyse all these issues carefully, look at them and consult with you on what we should do in the near future. I am giving the floor to Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak. <…>"

However, there are always a lot of topics to discuss – it is clear, given the intense nature of our dialogue. At the beginning of our conversation in a bilateral format, I would like to note a significant growth in trade between our countries last year, as well as the continuing flow of investment. We have continued our vigorous joint efforts to resolve the Karabakh issue – now in a trilateral format together with our partners in Azerbaijan. There are quite a few outstanding issues and I am happy that the two of us have this opportunity to meet and discuss all of them. Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan: Thank you. Mr President, allow me again to thank you for organising the anniversary CSTO Summit and for the traditionally hospitable and warm reception. Of course, the 30th anniversary of the Collective Security Treaty and the 20th anniversary of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation is a remarkable and very important event for us. I believe we had a really substantive conversation. It is very important that this conversation is forward-looking and focused on the further development of our Organisation. It has been less than a month since my first official visit to the Russian Federation, when we also had a very substantive conversation. However, you were right in saying that our bilateral agenda is so busy that we could meet even more often for discussions. Of course, we always stay in contact with each other and speak by phone regularly. As regards the economy, I also want to note that since last March, after a certain slump, there have been signs that our bilateral economic ties are gaining momentum and, of course, we see that Russian businesses are interested in investing in Armenia. I know that you are also encouraging Russian business people to invest in Armenia, and I want to thank you for that. Of course, I hope and I am sure that today we will also discuss regional security and stability, the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement issue, as we noted in our joint statement, and also the role of the Co-Chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group. I would like to share some information with you and discuss this issue as well. Again, thank you for the reception. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. <…>"

We have already worked half a day on the CSTO agenda and now we have an opportunity to talk about our bilateral relations. There are plenty of issues to discuss but I would like to say at the outset that, in general, our relations are developing positively. Last year, there was remarkable growth in our trade– by 34 percent, if I am not mistaken. Russia is solidly in first place among Kyrgyzstan's trade partners. Of course, there are issues that have to be discussed separately. I am happy that we can talk them over on the sidelines of today's international event. President of Kyrgyzstan Sadyr Japarov Japarov SadyrPresident of the Kyrgyz Republic: Thank you, Mr Putin. Thank you for the warm welcome. I am very happy to have the opportunity to meet with you. First, I would like to congratulate all of us on the 77th anniversary of the Great Victory. This year we are also marking the 30th anniversary of our diplomatic relations. I congratulate you and the great Russian people you represent on this anniversary. We are always interested in and ready for cooperation with the Russian Federation in all areas.

Now we have a chance to discuss our bilateral relations one-on-one. Here everything is developing well overall. Over the last year, our trade grew by more than 34 percent. About $17 billion has been invested by Russian companies in the economy of Kazakhstan. The overall situation is progressing despite the current difficulties that we are all aware of. Nevertheless, we have things to discuss in the bilateral format, related both to security that we discussed within the CSTO and the economy. I am very happy to have this opportunity, Mr President. President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev Tokayev Kassym-JomartPresident of the Republic of Kazakhstan: Thank you, Mr President. I am glad to have the chance to meet. Last time we met in here this hall on February 10. Indeed, there is no reason to be disappointed with the dynamics of trade and economic cooperation, or political interaction between our countries. Bilateral trade has reached $25 billion. Russia is Kazakhstan's main trade and economic partner, so the tasks that I set before our government are not only to maintain these dynamics and the volume of trade and investment, but also to increase them despite all the difficulties arising from modern geopolitical realities. I brought along with me the top officials of the Kazakhstani government who are responsible for these matters, led by the First Deputy Prime Minister. They had very productive talks. The goal set to them was to work with the Russian government in a businesslike, no-nonsense manner, in order to achieve concrete practical results. I am planning to take part in the St Petersburg International Economic Forum on June 17, at your invitation. Our government delegation is also planning to take part in a very large industrial exhibition that will be held in early July in Yekaterinburg. This autumn we plan to take part in the traditional forum of border regions. That is, the programme of our work, joint work and interaction is very extensive. Vladimir Putin: I am very glad to have a chance to talk with you. Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: Thank you. <…>"

The main focus of the summit was on key issues of cooperation within the CSTO, topical international and regional problems, and measures to further improve the collective security system. During the meeting, the leaders signed a Statement of the CSTO Collective Security Council(CSC) in connection with the 30th anniversary of the Collective Security Treaty and the 20th anniversary of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation. They also signed a resolution of the CSTO CSC to award the participants in the CSTO peacekeeping mission in the Republic of Kazakhstan.*** President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, good afternoon! I am glad to welcome you all in Moscow. At the suggestion of our chairman, and today Armenia chairs the organisation, we gathered in Moscow, because this is where 30 years ago the Collective Security Treaty was signed, and 20 years ago, on the basis of this Treaty, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation was created. This means we have two anniversaries almost on the same day: on May 14 and 15 in 1992 and 2002, respectively. I congratulate you on this. I hope that the organisation, which has become a full international structure over the years, will continue to develop, even through difficult times. I would like to note in this context that both 1992 and 2002 were difficult times; they never end. The organisation plays a very important role in the post-Soviet space– a stabilising role. I hope that in this sense its capabilities and influence on the situation in our area of responsibility will only grow. Here I would like to finish my welcoming remarks and give the floor to the Chairman[of the CSTO Collective Security Council], the Prime Minister of Armenia. Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan Pashinyan NikolPrime Minister of the Republic of Armenia: Thank you, Mr Putin. Colleagues, I would like to welcome all of you! I would also like to add my congratulations on the two anniversaries the President of Russia noted. The Treaty on Collective Security was signed on May 15, 1992, and the decision on establishing a Collective Security Treaty Organisation was made on May 14, 2002. We meet today partly in commemoration of both anniversaries. I suggest we express our views on these anniversaries and on the current situation as always– in alphabetic order. Please hold your comments to 3 to 5 minutes– this is the open section. Afterwards, we will sign the documents that are ready for signing, and will then continue our discussion behind closed doors. I give the floor to the President of the Republic of Belarus. Go ahead, please. President of the Republic of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko Lukashenko AlexanderPresident of Belarus: Mr Pashinyan, dear friends! I will talk a bit longer than usual since I am the first to speak, and the current situation deserves attention. Today's meeting is taking place in a difficult time, as the President of Russia has just said– a time of repartitioning the world; the unipolar international system is irretrievably receding into the past, but the collective West is fiercely fighting to keep its position. Anything goes, including actions in the zone of responsibility of our organisation: from NATO's sabre rattling at our western borders to a full-scale hybrid war unleashed against us, primarily against Russia and Belarus. NATO is aggressively building its muscles, drawing Finland and Sweden into its net, countries that only yesterday were neutral. This is based on the attitude,""those who are not with us are against us,"" and, hypocritically, NATO continues to declare its defensive nature. The truly defensive and peace-loving position of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation is in contrast to this background. The United States is building up its military presence on the western flank of the CSTO, its military infrastructure is being upgraded at an accelerated pace and many NATO exercises are taking place. The large-scale exercise, Defender Europe 2022, the likes of which we have not seen before, are now being held on the territory of 19 European countries, in part, near our borders in Poland. You can guess for yourselves whom they are defending themselves against. Until now, there is a force of about 15,000 military personnel stationed at the Belarusian-Polish border, which were deployed there last year under the pretext of a migration crisis, in addition to the troops that are stationed there permanently. Last year, 15,000 troops, mostly Americans, were redeployed. The migrants left that area a long time ago, but the troops are still there. The question is why? Clearly, no country is posing any threat to NATO today. Moreover, an additional force of over 10,000 military troops was brought there to reinforce the alliance's eastern flank with 15,000 troops already deployed in Poland and the Baltic countries as part of the US armed forces' Atlantic Resolve and NATO-allied Enhanced Forward Presence. For perspective, seven or so years ago, there were 3,500 troops in this location(addressing the CSTO Secretary General Stanislav Zas) on your watch, now there are about 40,000 troops right on the territory of Poland and the Baltic states. And I am not talking about Ukraine yet. Our military interaction within the framework of the Union State of Belarus and Russia, and Belarus' membership in the CSTO, are the very stabilisers that have a certain sobering effect on the hotheads on the other side of the border. This shows that if it were not for this, I am afraid that a hot war would already be underway in Belarus. By the way, they tried to do this in 2020. Today, there is no more pressing or important issue than the Ukraine conflict. Since 2014, all of us have been assisting in every way possible in resolving it. In principle, all of us sitting at this table are ready to do this even now and in any format. Clearly, Ukraine was fomented, incited and fed nationalism and Nazism. We saw that in Odessa, when people were burned alive. Ukraine was fed Nazism, Russophobia and weapons. They used every approach to poison it. After the election in Belarus in August 2020, regarding interaction with us, Belarus, Ukraine completely succumbed to the West. We have constantly experienced unfriendly actions from our southern neighbour for over two years now. Ukraine proactively imposed sanctions on us even before the West, including the Americans. Ukraine was the first to do so. Remember? Their airspace was closed, then railway service, and then they began to train militants and send them to Belarus and ship weapons across the border. Everyone knows that. Provocative actions were carried out with Ukrainian drones conducting reconnaissance missions in Belarus' airspace. The facts indicating a threat to our national security are indisputable. This is exactly why we were absolutely right to activate the support mechanism in the framework of our alliance with Russia. Belarus paid attention to the unjustified growth of the Western military presence in Ukraine and the region as a whole even before the start of the Russian special military operation. We talked about this more than once and warned that a conflict was looming. We expected the West, primarily the US, to accept Russia's proposal to enter into talks on security guarantees. This process will start eventually in the foreseeable future but what will remain of Ukraine and our region by this time is a big question. Right now, we are seeing that the West, including Washington, is only interested in prolonging the conflict as much as possible. This is why Ukraine is being flooded with weapons. The goals are clear: to weaken Russia as much as possible by miring it in this war. The flames may reach beyond it– we are seeing this, too. If this is the idea, likely nobody will be able to sit it out. Currently the most dangerous trend in Ukraine are the attempts to partition the country. Thousand-strong units have already been formed to enter Ukraine in the guise of peacekeepers to""protect"" it. Unity and solidarity among like-minded people are particularly important at a time when norms and principles of international law are being completely ignored. The CSTO member states displayed such solidarity and support in January of this year in a time of trial: you remember the events in Kazakhstan. By acting rapidly when needed, we graphically demonstrated to the entire world our close allied relations and the capacity of our organisation to ensure the security of its members. Nobody in the West even dared think about interfering in this situation because we are stronger together. But is it possible to claim today that the members of this organisation are really united and bound by ties of solidarity and support as before? Recent events suggest probably not. This is from our perspective, and I may be wrong. But it is enough to recall the ban imposed by some of our CSTO partners on the flights to their countries by national airlines of other CSTO members. The concepts of unity and solidarity are not always enough, given the brutal, rabid sanctions pressure by the consolidated West. Unfortunately, this is clear from the voting in international organisations. With the tacit agreement of our partners, Belarus and Russia are being vilified and expelled from international organisations against all laws of international life, just on a Western whim. Yes, you, CSTO members are subjected to pressure– tough and unprincipled pressure– but this is where collective, mutual support is so helpful. We may not exist tomorrow if we do not unite as soon as possible, if we do not strengthen our political, economic and military ties. Our enemies and detractors are systematically degrading our strongholds and allied ties, and we ourselves are partially helping the West in this regard. I am sure that if we had acted as a united front right off the bat, the hellish, as they say, sanctions would be out of question. Look how united the European Union is when it votes or acts, and how strong its intra-bloc discipline is. It applies automatically even to those who disagree with its decisions. This begs the question: What is keeping us from using this bloc resource? We need to follow their example. If divided, we will simply be crushed and torn apart. Back in January, I said that the main goal of certain external forces is to undermine stability and to disrupt the evolutionary path of development throughout the post-Soviet space. They started with Belarus, then the infection spread to Kazakhstan, and now it is Russia's turn, as we see, and problems are being created in Armenia as well. Make no mistake, no one will be spared. It is absolutely clear that, without united pushback from the CSTO allies and other integration associations in the post-Soviet space, the collective West will ratchet up its pressure. What do we need to do to reinforce the CSTO in this unprecedented situation at hand? Off the top of my head, I can visualise the following top-priority steps, which are many, and the President of Tajikistan covered them at length when he talked about the challenge facing that region. The first is to strengthen political interaction and coordination of the CSTO member states. It is important to improve the efficiency of the foreign policy and security consultation mechanism. We need to speak more often on behalf of the CSTO on international platforms so that its voice and position can be seen and heard, and this voice and position must be united as they are in the West. Let our foreign ministers consider how best to go about this, and where. Let them think about our political response to a new wave of NATO expansion in light of the intentions declared by well-known states. We must work out in advance the CSTO position on this matter and make our interests known to the international community. We must act as one in this. Russia should not be alone in voicing its concern and fighting the attempted NATO enlargement. The second point is to increase the effectiveness of efforts to counter challenges and threats in the information space, including the fight against fake news and disinformation. It is clear that we are facing a hybrid war, the main part of which is an information war. In order to counter this, we should make the most of the 2017 CSTO Agreement on Information Security Cooperation and actively promote the CSTO on social media, which our Western opponents intensively use, in order to effectively respond to fake news and planted information. Moreover, we need to think seriously and, perhaps, follow China's policy in the information confrontation, especially on the internet. Relevant tasks should be assigned to all foreign ministries, special services and the CSTO Secretariat. Third, there is a clear need to strengthen the forecasting and analytical component in the CSTO Secretariat's work. I am sure that there are similar departments in the UN, the European Union and NATO. It might be worth considering creating a unit responsible for analysis and strategic planning at the CSTO Secretariat. I think the Secretary-General needs to study this issue. Fourth, it is worth thinking about combining the potential of the analytical centres of the CSTO member states and forming a network of these centres to assist in the development of conceptual documents on current issues on the international agenda. Dear friends, I am offering such seemingly simple proposals at these extremely difficult times because we may not immediately agree on more complex ones. Therefore, these may be the first steps, but we need to go further and deeper, as we used to say in the past Colleagues, Everyone understands that the historical era that existed before is ending, and there will be no return to the previous international order. We cannot allow the creation of a new international architecture without us, while the West is already planting false stories and holding talks about it. I believe that the CSTO should firmly strengthen its status in the international system of checks and balances. The organisation has a powerful collective potential for further progressive development, but it depends only on us today, it is up to us, how effectively the CSTO will use this potential and whether it will continue to exist in the next 10, 20 or 30 years. After Armenia, the CSTO chairmanship will rotate to Belarus. In addition to the promising areas of work outlined above, we are already seriously considering new proposals aimed at the further development of our organisation, and you will learn about them in the near future. We hope for maximum support and constructive work from all of you, our colleagues. We have no other choice. Sorry for such a long speech. Thank you for your attention. Nikol Pashinyan: Thank you, Mr Lukashenko. I will give the floor to President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev Tokayev Kassym-JomartPresident of the Republic of Kazakhstan: Mr Pashinyan, colleagues! First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to President of Russia Vladimir Putin for organising this anniversary summit of the Collective Security Council. It is true that our summit today is distinct in marking two CSTO anniversaries. Over the years our organisation has proven to be an effective mechanism of multilateral cooperation with serious potential for further development. Once the CSTO was established, a reliable system for collective security was built in the vast expanse of Eurasia. The main goals are to strengthen peace and stability as well as international and regional security, and protect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of its member states. The CSTO's permanent working bodies operate successfully; there are various formats for close cooperation and interaction. The CSTO's authority, law enforcement and peacekeeping potential are being strengthened. We focus on countering international terrorism and extremism, illegal drug and weapons trafficking, and illegal migration. In this context we attach great importance to the developments in Afghanistan. The unstable situation there as well as the unrelenting activity of armed groups on the territory of Afghanistan continue to threaten the security and stability of our states. I believe the CSTO must consider every potential threat while paying even more attention to ensuring the security of the southern borders of Central Asia. In the mid-term, developing the organisation's peacekeeping potential is an unconditional priority. Active work is underway in this area. CSTO peacekeeping forces have been created and are being improved every year; a plan is being developed to equip them with modern weapons, equipment and special tools. As you know, the institute of Special Representative of the CSTO Secretary-General for peacekeeping has been established, at Kazakhstan's initiative. This means that all the necessary tools have been created, and we suggest that it is time to set the goal of getting the CSTO involved with the United Nations' peacekeeping activities. This step would promote the legal status of the CSTO and ensure the organisation's participation in international peacekeeping operations. Colleagues, Our assessments of the CSTO's development and common view of the current aspects of international and regional security underlie the anniversary statement of the Collective Security Council. I would like to thank Armenia for its productive chairmanship and Russia for its timely initiative to hold this forum. Thank you for your attention. Nikol Pashinyan:Thank you, Mr Tokayev. Next to speak is President of the Kyrgyz Republic. Mr Sadyr Japarov, please, take the floor. President of the Kyrgyz Republic Sadyr Japarov Japarov SadyrPresident of the Kyrgyz Republic: Good afternoon. Mr Putin, Mr Chairman of the CSTO Collective Security Council Nikol Pashinyan, Messrs heads of state, I am happy to meet with you in hospitable Moscow. I would like to begin with congratulations. First, I want to extend my congratulations to our fraternal peoples on the 77th anniversary of the Great Victory. On May 9, many thousands of people across Kyrgyzstan took part in the Immortal Regiment march carrying the slogans""Eternal Glory to the Heroes"" and""Nobody Is Forgotten, Nothing Is Forgotten."" The republic holds this holiday sacred, as it epitomises the defeat of Nazism and Fascism by the Soviet people and invariably pays a sincere tribute to the memory of the heroic deed of our fathers and grandfathers. Second, I want to extend my congratulations to all of us on the 30th anniversary of signing the Collective Security Treaty and the 20th anniversary of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation. We fully support the political statement to be adopted today in connection with these two historic dates. The international events taking place in recent years show that the strategic decisions taken to ensure shared and collective security from Brest to Vladivostok were right. At the same time, I am pleased to note that throughout its existence the Collective Security Treaty Organisation has fulfilled the responsible mission assigned to it and developed as an institution, with its potential becoming ever stronger. In this connection, I would like to express my gratitude to CSTO Secretary-General Stanislav Zas, all his predecessors in the post and the CSTO Secretariat staff for their loyal service in the interests of the security of the Organisation's member states. Colleagues, The current international situation does not offer cause for optimism, in terms of both global security and the world economy. Threats to security and military and political tensions have come too close to the borders of the CSTO zone of responsibility. Attempts are being made to interfere from the outside in the internal affairs of the CSTO member states. For example, earlier this year we had to help a CSTO member state get out of a security crisis it had unexpectedly found itself in. Our response was quick and effective. I fully support the decision to award participants in this peacekeeping mission. The situation at the southern borders of the CSTO remains alarming, primarily due to the unhindered activities of radical religious terrorist groups in some Afghan provinces. The external sponsors of these groups have far-reaching plans for Central Asia. I think we should keep focusing our attention and analysis on the Afghan issue. It is necessary to carry out an entire package of political-diplomatic and military-technical measures to ensure security in this area. At the same time, it is important to provide humanitarian aid for the Afghan people. Our fellow countrymen are among them. Colleagues, We are seriously alarmed by the sanctions war. The Kyrgyz economy has not yet recovered from the coronavirus pandemic, and now the sanctions are already creating a threat to food and energy security, macroeconomic sustainability and social stability. Under the circumstances, we must discuss and draft a common approach to alleviate the consequences of sanctions and prevent the deterioration of the socioeconomic situation in our countries. We will soon have an opportunity to do so at the meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council and the First Eurasian Economic Forum in the city of Bishkek. Colleagues, I hope for your personal participation as heads of your delegations, in which I am asking you to include heads of sectoral ministries and business structures. In conclusion, I would like to congratulate you again on the Day of the Great Victory and the two anniversaries of the Collective Security Treaty. I sincerely wish you and the friendly nations of the CSTO peace, stability, wellbeing and prosperity. Thank you for your attention. Nikol Pashinyan: Thank you, Mr Japarov. I am giving the floor to President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin. Mr President, go ahead, please. Vladimir Putin: Friends and colleagues, I will agree with the previous speakers– indeed, in the past few decades, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation has become considerably stronger and won a well-deserved reputation as an effective regional defence structure that ensures security and stability in the Eurasian space and reliably protects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its member countries. Importantly, cooperation in the CSTO has always been built in the spirit of true allied relations, on the principles of friendship and neighbourliness, respect and consideration of each other's interests, mutual assistance and support. The same principles guide our cooperation in the current difficult situation. The CSTO's successful peacekeeping operation, held in Kazakhstan in January 2022 at the request of its leaders, showed the maturity of our Organisation and its real ability to adequately withstand acute challenges and threats. The contingent of the collective CSTO forces, sent into Kazakhstan for a limited period of time, prevented extremists, including those directed from abroad, from seizing power and helped to quickly stabilise the internal political situation in the republic. The use of peacekeeping forces at the request of the Kazakhstan leadership was the first operation of this kind in the CSTO's history. The operation revealed the strong points of practical cooperation between our military structures and security services, and, at the same time, showed what we should work on to improve it. Today, we will sign a joint statement reaffirming, taking into account the experience gained, among other things, during the afore-mentioned operation, the resolve of our states to continue acting as partners in different areas of military and defence development, and building up our coordinated actions in the world arena. At the same time, it is quite logical that our current high-priority task is to further improve and streamline the work of the CSTO and its governing bodies. We will also provide the collective CSTO forces with modern weapons and equipment, we will enhance the interoperability of their troop contingents, and more effectively coordinate the joint actions of our military agencies and secret services. We streamline the relevant operations all the time during CSTO exercises, and we are set to expand such exercises. This autumn, there are plans to hold an entire series of joint CSTO exercises in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. I am confident that these measures will boost the combat readiness of our states' military agencies and improve their coordination, as well as increase the entire peacekeeping potential of the CSTO. We also believe that the CSTO should continue its efforts to counter terrorism, drug trafficking and organised crime. Law enforcement agencies of our countries interact rather effectively in this field, so as to prevent the recruitment of people and to neutralise the resource potential of international terrorist organisations. Efforts to maintain biological security also require the most serious attention. For a long time, we sounded the alarm about US military biological activity in the post-Soviet space. It is common knowledge that the Pentagon has established dozens of specialised biological laboratories and centres in our common region, and that they are by no means merely providing practical medical assistance to the population of the countries where they are operating. Their main task is to collect biological materials and to analyse the spread of viruses and dangerous diseases for their own purposes. Now, during the special operation in Ukraine, documentary evidence was obtained that components of biological weapons were developed in close proximity to our borders, which violates the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, and possible methods and mechanisms were worked out to destabilise the epidemiological situation in the post-Soviet space. In this regard, we count on our colleagues supporting the earliest possible implementation of Russia's initiative to operationalise the designated CSTO council. Once again, I would like to note the importance of close coordination between CSTO members in matters of foreign policy, coordinated actions at the UN and other multilateral platforms, and promotion of common approaches to the multiplying international security issues. In this context, it is important to build up cooperation with our""natural"" partners in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the Commonwealth of Independent States. By the way, we think it would be appropriate and correct– we will discuss this– to grant the CIS observer status in the CSTO. I would like to highlight our priority task of jointly defending the memory of Victory in the Great Patriotic War, the feat of our peoples who saved the world from Nazism at the cost of enormous and irreparable sacrifices, and to counteract any attempts to whitewash the Nazis, their accomplices and modern followers. This is extremely important particularly now, when monuments to the heroes liberators are being barbarously demolished in a number of European countries, laying flowers at memorials is forbidden, and cynical attempts are being made to rewrite history, while praising murderers and traitors and insulting their victims, thus crossing out the feats of those who selflessly fought for Victory and won the war. Unfortunately, in our neighbouring country, Ukraine, neo-Nazism has been on the rise for a long time now, to which some of our partners from the""collective West"" turn a blind eye, and thus actually encourage their activities. All this goes hand-in-hand with an unprecedented surge in frenzied Russophobia in the so-called civilised and politically correct Western countries. Indeed, we hear, and I hear people say that extremists can be found anywhere, which is true. Extremists are everywhere and one way or another they are leaving their underground hideouts and make themselves known. Nowhere, though– I want to underscore this– nowhere are Nazis being glorified at the state level and not a single civilised country's authorities are encouraging thousands of neo-Nazi torchlight processions with Nazi symbols. This is something that is not practiced anywhere. But unfortunately, this is happening in Ukraine. The expansion of the North Atlantic Alliance is a problem that, in my view, is being created in an absolutely artificial manner because it is being done in the foreign policy interests of the United States. Generally, NATO is being used, in effect, as the foreign policy tool of a single country, and it is being done persistently, adroitly, and very aggressively. All of this is aggravating the already complex international security situation. As for the expansion, including the accession of two prospective new members, Finland and Sweden, I would like to inform you, colleagues, that Russia has no problems with these states. No problems at all! In this sense, therefore, there is no direct threat to Russia in connection with NATO's expansion to these countries. But the expansion of its military infrastructure to these territories will certainly evoke a response on our part. We will see what it will be like based on the threats that are created for us. But generally speaking, problems are being created from nothing. So, we will respond to it in a fitting manner. Apart from everything else, apart from this interminable policy of expansion, the North Atlantic Alliance is emerging beyond its geographical destination, beyond the Euro-Atlantic area. It is increasingly active in trying to manage international issues and control the international security situation. It wants to wield influence in other regions of the world, but its actual performance leaves much to be desired. This certainly demands additional attention on our part. In conclusion, I want to reiterate that Russia will continue to contribute to deepening relations of strategic alliance with all CSTO member states. We will do our best to improve and develop effective partner cooperation within the CSTO and, of course, we will support the Armenian chairmanship's ongoing work in this area. As for Russia's special military operation in Ukraine, we will certainly discuss this, and I will inform you in detail about its causes and the current combat effort. But, of course, we will do this behind closed doors. Thank you for your attention. Nikol Pashinyan: Thank you, Mr Putin. President of the Republic of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon is our next speaker. Please go ahead. President of the Republic of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon: Colleagues, First of all, I would like to congratulate you on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the signing of the Collective Security Treaty and the 20th anniversary of the creation of the CSTO. I would like to thank the President of Russia for convening today's meeting dedicated to these milestone events that are important for all of us. Anniversaries are a good opportunity to reflect on the path traveled and the development of the CSTO and to identify prospects for multilateral cooperation seeking to strengthen the common collective security system in light of new realities. Over the period under review, the CSTO has established itself as an important factor in strengthening peace and ensuring regional security and stability. The organisation's successful peacekeeping mission earlier this year clearly showed it. We have created an extensive legal framework, the necessary working and coordinating bodies, as well as mechanisms aimed at fulfilling the organisation's goals. In practice, due attention is paid to strengthening and consolidating mutual trust within the CSTO. The CSTO's international ties are expanding. Last year, we completed the ratification procedure and launched the institutions of observers under the CSTO and the CSTO partners as part of the Tajik chairmanship. Field and command-staff exercises are conducted on a permanent basis, and measures are being taken to supply modern weapons and military equipment to the collective security system's forces and means. All this helps maintain a high degree of combat readiness, mobility, training and skills of command and service personnel for bringing joint solutions to common tasks. Today, the CSTO is an important platform for equal dialogue and cooperation between member states in all three basic dimensions: political interaction, military cooperation and joint efforts to counter modern challenges and threats. The CSTO Collective Security Strategy to 2025, which reflects the principles of our interaction in the mid-term, is an important document that is guiding our organisation along its own path of development. Our common assessment of the state and development prospects of the organisation is reflected in a joint statement that we will adopt following the summit. Notably, today we are facing no less important tasks to strengthen our common security. Given the manifold growth of challenges and threats to security, we will have to step up joint efforts to strengthen the Organisation's potential and capabilities. For example, we can see that negative factors have been accumulating in Afghanistan over the past 40 years, and they have worsened the military-political and socioeconomic situation in that country. In this regard, the CSTO needs to be prepared for various scenarios on the southern borders. Tajikistan plans to continue to actively contribute to ensuring common security in the organisation's regions of responsibility. Thank you. Nikol Pashinyan: Thank you very much. Colleagues, I will now speak in my national capacity, if I may. First of all, I would like to thank the President of Russia for hosting the anniversary CSTO summit in Moscow and the warm welcome. Of course, our organisation's anniversary is also an excellent occasion to sum up the intermediate results and to discuss prospects for the further development of our organisation. The President of Belarus raised important questions about interaction between the CSTO member countries and touched on, frankly, rather problematic issues. In general, there are a lot of positive developments in the history of the CSTO, because in reality it was, is and will be the most important factor in ensuring security and stability in the region. But, as we see, we are discussing not only anniversary-related issues at this anniversary summit, because the situation is fairly tense in the CSTO area of ​​responsibility. I want to touch on some of the issues that the President of Belarus mentioned. Regarding voting by the CSTO member countries, this issue does exist, indeed. Often, our voting is not synchronised, but this is not something new. This has been typical of our organisation for a long time now. Armenia has repeatedly raised this issue, and we have repeatedly discussed it in the regular course of business. Clearly, this issue needs to be further discussed as well. With regard to interaction as well as response and rapid response mechanisms, this is also a critical issue for Armenia, because, as you are aware, last year on these days, Azerbaijani troops invaded the sovereign territory of Armenia. Armenia turned to the CSTO for it to activate the mechanisms that are provided for in the Regulations governing the CSTO response to crisis situations of December 10, 2010 which is a document approved by the Collective Security Council. Unfortunately, we cannot say that the organisation responded as the Republic of Armenia expected. For a long time now, we have been raising the issue of sales of weapons by CSTO member countries to a country that is unfriendly to Armenia, which used these weapons against Armenia and the Armenian people. This is also a problem. Frankly, the CSTO member countries' response during the 44-day war of 2020 and the post-war period did not make the Republic of Armenia and the Armenian people very happy, but I want to emphasise the special role played by the Russian Federation and President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin personally in halting the war in Nagorno-Karabakh. I would like to reaffirm that Armenia remains committed to the trilateral statements of November 9, 2020. I am referring to the trilateral statements by the President of the Russian Federation, the President of Azerbaijan and the Prime Minister of Armenia, as well as the trilateral statements of January 11, 2021 and November 26, 2021. I think it is critically important to sum up the results, but Armenia, as a founding member of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, is committed to the organisation's further development and considers it a key contributor to stability and security in the Eurasian region, as well as the security of the Republic of Armenia, and is positive about providing its full support for the organisation's further development. Now I give the floor to CSTO Secretary General Stanislav Zas so that he tells us about the documents that we are going to sign. CSTO Secretary General Stanislav Zas: Mr Chairman, members of the Collective Security Council, First, I would like to thank you for today's meeting devoted to the CSTO's anniversary. Twenty years is not such a long period for an international organisation. However, it has traversed a very long road during these years– from the formation of the idea of collective defence to the well-established, multi-faceted international organisation that it is today. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you, heads of state, on the anniversary and to thank you for your hard work on establishing, developing and strengthening our organisation. I am saying this because, of course, all this would have been impossible without your constant attention and support. You have an analytical review of the CSTO activities over 20 years of its existence in your folders on the table. This review was prepared at the instruction of the President of the Republic of Tajikistan. Incidentally, our work on this review was very interesting and useful. On the eve of such great anniversaries, we tried to look back at the path travelled and to assess the CSTO's status. We developed a good feeling that stayed with us: We have reasons to be proud. The mechanism of foreign policy coordination is functioning well in the CSTO format. Using this mechanism, we form the consolidated position of our states on urgent regional and global issues. That said, I agree with the President of Belarus that this is clearly not enough these days. We should not avoid answers, consolidated answers to the most pressing issues. We have developed cooperation with international regional organisations and their relevant structures. We have preserved and, importantly, are cultivating the principle of prioritising political and diplomatic means to achieve CSTO goals. This is, probably, one of the main pillars of our organisation. Over these years, we have considerably built up the CSTO's military capacity. We are upgrading the structure, equipment and training of the bodies in charge of managing and forming a collective security system. We consider the formation of a uniform system for training personnel, management bodies and troops an important achievement of the CSTO. Of course, the highest form of this system is embodied in the planned joint miscellaneous exercises that we hold every year. We created and are developing an effective mechanism to counter modern challenges and threats, such as drug trafficking, illegal migration, international terrorism, and crime using information technology. To this end, joint emergency and preventive measures are taken and special operations are carried out regularly. The results prove their relevance and effectiveness. The formation of a collective biological security toolkit is nearing completion. This topic was raised today, and I think we will return to it. An important place is occupied by the CSTO crisis response system. Considering the first practical experience gained in Kazakhstan in testing this system, it probably makes sense that today we will also consider issues of improving the crisis response system. The further development of our organisation will be carried out taking into account your decisions and instructions– I am grateful for today's initiatives and instructions– and based on the plan for implementing the CSTO Collective Security Strategy until 2025. By the way, next year we need to start preparing the initial data to develop a new CSTO Collective Security Strategy for the next period, 2026–2030. It is high time, and the situation now is significantly different than it was five years ago. This also means a lot of work to be done, and it probably requires that our countries join analytical forces. Mr Chair and members of the Collective Security Council, The following two documents have been submitted for your consideration and signing: a draft statement of the CSTO Collective Security Council on the 30th anniversary of the Collective Security Treaty and the 20th anniversary of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation; and a draft decision of the Collective Security Council""On awarding participants in the CSTO peacekeeping mission in the Republic of Kazakhstan."" The draft decision recognises the most distinguished participants in the peacekeeping operation. Six members of our militaries, including commander of our peacekeeping mission in Kazakhstan, Colonel General Andrei Serdyukov, are recommended for the CSTO honourary badge, I and II Class, for their skillful leadership, preparation and conduct of this operation, and a number of military personnel are recommended for the medal For Strengthening Collective Security for active participation and selflessness in this operation. The documents have passed the necessary approval procedure, have been adopted by the statutory bodies and are ready for signing. I would ask you to consider and support these two documents. Thank you. Nikol Pashinyan: Colleagues, I propose to move on to the signing of the documents. <…>"

We have a good reason, namely, two anniversaries, that of the Collective Security Treaty itself and the Collective Security Treaty Organisation that was established on the basis of the treaty. And, of course, this is a very good reason for discussing the situation regarding our bilateral relations. I am very happy to note that Russia remains the main trade and economic partner of Tajikistan in terms of trade volumes. Last year, bilateral trade soared by an impressive amount, nearly 45 percent, as well as by over 70 percent in the first three months of 2022. We need to maintain this good trend. This can be explained by reasons, linked with the current situation, but everything shows a continuing need for our relationship and that it is developing most actively. Of course, you and I recently spoke on the telephone about the regional situation, which remains complicated. I am most interested in learning your opinion as to what should be done in the near future in order to strengthen our security in this direction. I am delighted to see you, welcome.

Only recently, we marked Victory Day, Russia's most important holiday. I would like to remind you that our country won this war not only by fighting on the frontlines, but also because of its economic might. At the time, it had to confront not only Germany's industrial potential, but Europe as a whole, enslaved as it was by the Nazis. This is just something I wanted to mention. Now, let us move on to our agenda. Over the past two months, we held a series of meetings on the economic situation. Together with Government members, heads of regions, senior Central Bank officials and businesses, we have been consistent in our efforts to promote stable economic development. We have been doing this in a challenging environment. I am referring to the complicated global situation, as well as the pressure applied by Western countries through sanctions. Incidentally, the global crisis is largely caused by these sanctions. Those who conceived them proceeded from short-sighted, exaggerated political ambitions and Russophobia, at the expense of their own national interests, their own economies and the wellbeing of their people, as primarily demonstrated by the rising inflation in Europe. In some countries, the annual rate of inflation is approaching 20%, while prices in the eurozone increased by over 11%, on average. According to objective laws governing the economy, it is obvious that in this ongoing sanctions frenzy, if I may say so, the European Union and its people will inevitably face consequences that will be hard to reverse. The same applies to the world's poorest countries, which are already at risk of hunger. Let me emphasise that full responsibility for all this lies squarely with the Western elites, who are ready to sacrifice the rest of the world for the sake of preserving their global dominance. In turn, Russia is confidently dealing with external challenges due to the responsible macroeconomic policy of the past few years and systemic decisions and solutions to strengthen its economic sovereignty, technological and food security. Our production companies are gradually filling domestic market niches vacated after unscrupulous partners left the country. This concerns daily staple goods, industrial and service sector equipment, construction and farming machinery. We are expecting a good harvest this year. According to preliminary expert estimates, we may harvest 130 million tonnes of grain, including 87 million tonnes of wheat. If this happens, then the projected grain harvests would hit an all-time high in Russian history. This will make it possible to meet domestic demand, with a substantial safety margin, and to expand global exports for our partners; this is highly important for global food markets. Inflation is gradually subsiding. Last month, inflation rates fell several-fold on March levels. Weekly price hikes are down to 0.1 percent. This closely matches weekly growth rates under Bank of Russia inflation targets. The budgetary system's capabilities continue to expand. In January-April, the consolidated budget surplus reached 2.7 trillion rubles, while budgetary spending has grown appreciably over the same period following decisions to finance development projects and purchase prepayments earlier than planned. The national currency, the ruble, is growing stronger in conditions of a record-breaking foreign trade surplus. It appears that it is posting better results than all other foreign currencies since early 2022. At the same time, I would like to note some trends that require special attention. For example, domestic demand is short of 2021 parameters. Corporate and private accounts continue to shrink. Obviously, these factors impact economic development trends, and it is necessary to reduce these risks by relying on our successful experience of targeted actions during the 2020–2021 pandemic. As before, today, the most important indicator of successful socioeconomic policy is the income of Russian citizens. To ensure positive dynamics here, it is necessary to support consumer demand and improve the opportunities for businesses and regions. Several relevant decisions have already been made. We know about them as we worked on them together. In March, we decided to expand the financial aid programme for families with children in need. From April, it was extended to include families with children aged up to 16 years. Backdated payments have been made since May 11. We have also arranged for additional financial support for the constituent entities, by restructuring regional debt and granting loans from the federal budget. I would like to note once again that all the procedures must be as clear and convenient for the regions as possible. These mechanisms must motivate regions to finance additional economic development programmes, including a capital boost for regional industrial development funds, and they must also ensure that all obligations and programmes are fulfilled on the ground and that major construction projects are continued. All these measures are compulsory. With respect to businesses, we have developed a lending programme for backbone companies, secured by VEB. Such loans are expected to amount to 1.6 trillion rubles. There are specific decisions to support key industries such as aviation, agriculture and food production. Next, in late April, we agreed to take special measures to grant additional resources to the economy – as professionals say, to saturate it with liquidity. This is important for the continuous operation of companies and organisations and for maintaining and even increasing the number of jobs. These measures include deferring social contribution payments for the second quarter of 2022. There was extensive discussion of this matter and a decision was made. Companies which employ almost 52 million people in total will be eligible for this concession. Social contributions for these organisations will be deferred for a year, starting from May 2023. Overall, businesses will be able to keep around 1.1 trillion rubles in circulation. Essentially, this money will serve as an interest-free loan from the Government. In addition, companies in the production sector will be eligible for social contribution deferment in the third quarter of this year, amounting to another half a trillion rubles. I have instructed the Government to explore the issue of providing additional preferences with regard to repaying insurance contributions for the third quarter depending on employment and payroll retention. We went through this, as I said, during the pandemic. It is necessary to determine the exact criteria on this score. Yet another point, as I said, is that we have expanded the programme for the guaranteed support of lending to businesses by VEB. As you may know, an instruction has been issued to extend this programme to companies that are yet to obtain the status of major employers but have already emerged from the category of small and medium-sized businesses. Aided by VEB's guarantees, these organisations will be able to raise over one trillion rubles at attractive, lower rates due to the risk reduction. Let me also note that the Bank of Russia continues easing its monetary and lending policy and making loans more widely available in general. The Central Bank key rate, as you know, has been reduced to 14 percent. Given this dynamics, we have taken the decision to reduce the favourable mortgage rate to 9 percent. Loans at this rate are available as of May, while the favourable mortgage programme has been extended until the end of this year. This decision should be of help to the families that are planning to buy a flat and to improve their living conditions. We should go on thinking about this. And, of course, the favourable mortgage mechanisms will support the construction industry and the related economic sectors. Today, let us talk in more detail about how the measures of support for Russian family economics I have just mentioned are being implemented in practice and in real life. I also suggest that we discuss possible additional measures and steps designed to ensure the stability of economic trends and growth of real incomes. Let us go over to the agenda of our meeting. The floor goes to Mr Reshetnikov, Minister of Economic Development. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68390,Meeting of Talent and Success Foundation Board of Trustees,2022-05-11T16:10:00Z,Sochi,Vladimir Putin chaired a meeting of the Talent and Success Foundation Board of Trustees via videoconference.,"Members of the Board of Trustees attending the meeting included Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Anton Vaino, deputy prime ministers Tatyana Golikova and Dmitry Chernyshenko, Presidential Aides Igor Levitin and Andrei Fursenko, Head of the Presidential Directorate for Science and Education Policy Inna Bilenkina, founders of the Talent and Success Educational Foundation President of the Russian Figure Skating Federation Alexander Gorshkov, Vice President for Development of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) Valery Kamensky, Artistic Director of the Dmitry Shostakovich St Petersburg Academic Philharmonic Hall Yury Temirkanov, and Executive Director of the Moscow Centre for Continuous Math Education Ivan Yashchenko. The meeting was also attended by Talent and Success Foundation Director Yelena Shmeleva and senior managers of the Sirius Science and Technology University. Before the meeting of the Talent and Success Foundation Board of Trustees, the President visited the Sirius Educational Centre created at his initiative using Olympic facilities in Sochi. At the recently finished Sport building, Vladimir Putin toured a swimming pool, a gym and multi-purpose sports halls. The President was also introduced to the development concepts of the educational centre, the science and technology cluster, and other clusters on the Sirius federal territory. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, good afternoon. I am glad to see you all. Ms Shmeleva and I have just looked at the growing sports infrastructure at Sirius, walked around the Sports building for the educational centre students. I have no doubt that this place, as well as the entire Sirius federal territory, will pave the way for Russia's future victories, not only in sports, but also in culture and art, science and technology. I mean, initially, Sirius was created primarily for the development of science, technology and education. Undoubtedly, young people's energy and daring will help create new meanings, ideas and solutions. And Sirius will be a bright guiding star, living up to its name, and a guiding star for our talented young people, and not only in the span of the current decade, but for the entire 21st century. The scale of the goals that we are setting for the Sirius team should be fully consistent with its highly responsible mission. I propose that we discuss the specific steps to achieve these goals at today's meeting of the Board of Trustees of the Talent and Success Foundation. Sirius is primarily designed to play a tangible role in strengthening the country's technological sovereignty. This is always important, but particularly so today – I will not go into all the reasons now. But it is vital to fulfil our plans on creating a powerful innovation centre in the Imereti Valley. The centre's modern laboratory complex is supposed to open this summer, which will considerably enhance the scientific and education base at Sirius University, which was established last year. (Addressing Yelena Shmeleva) When is the laboratory base supposed to open? In fact, it is in the process of opening, given that the laboratories are operating. Head of the Talent and Success Educational Foundation Yelena Shmeleva: Yes, of course. Vladimir Putin: How many laboratories are there? Yelena Shmeleva: The laboratories are operating. Our colleagues from there have just joined us and will talk about this in more detail. In fact, we are embracing more and more programmes – both scientific and education programmes. The first stage will be ready this summer. As for the second and third stages of this laboratory complex, we are planning to develop them with our partners as part of the cluster. Vladimir Putin: Excellent. In this context, it is very important to approach the selection of companies – residents of federal territory. It is necessary to introduce clear, objective requirements for assessing their performance in terms of efficiency and responsibility for reaching the desired results. I would like to emphasise the following point: this is not about claiming a place in the IT and biotechnology park or building some beautiful office, important as this may be. We are now in this building. It is perfectly obvious that it is very comfortable, beautiful and modern. One is tempted to come here and not just to visit but to do everything that the opportunities here offer. This is why offices are also important. This is true. But if businesses come to Sirius, they need to make real breakthroughs, achieve commercial success and make commercially viable products, because here at Sirius success should be part of every step. And it is essential to be directly involved in creating education programmes for training a large number of people capable to work with advanced technology. In this regard, I would like to talk about what should be done in the near future – at least as I see it. I consider it necessary to work out new, accelerated mechanisms for training IT specialists at the IT college, which opened at Sirius, together with our high-tech companies. This is an absolute must, we understand this very well, as it is impossible to move forward without personnel. Second. I would ask Sirius, together with its partners, to create special modules on cybersecurity for technical universities and faculties, so that future engineers and designers, regardless of their focus, have strong skills in protecting our critical infrastructure, as well as domestic industrial and information systems. Further. One of the key areas of Sirius research is the creation of advanced solutions aimed at improving the quality of people's lives. First of all, this concerns such areas as genetics, medicine, pharmaceuticals, and environmental protection. One of the laboratories is dedicated to one of these areas, namely genetics, if I am not mistaken. In order to expand the capabilities of life sciences research, I propose speeding up the construction of a university clinic in Sirius. (Addressing Yelena Shmeleva) Although we need to draw a distinction – we have already discussed it – between the university clinic, training and science, and service for those who live in Sirius. Yelena Shmeleva: Yes. Vladimir Putin: It is clear that the university clinic can also do this, but it is necessary to distinguish between the areas of activity of the medical institution for serving people, and science and education. It is also necessary to establish an international centre for the environment and climate change. I would like to note that thanks to the innovative environment for scientific activity, leisure and sports, Sirius is becoming a magnet for Russian students, post-graduate students, scientists, and employees of high-tech companies. Despite certain restrictions, our compatriots living abroad, as well as specialists from China, India, Iran and many other countries, want to work here. Well, why not? The conditions are comfortable, the climate is wonderful. If we create conditions related to equipment for research, establish a school and ensure good medical care, then, I think, the number of people who want to live and work here will only increase. In a word, the number of residents of the federal territory will grow, and they must be provided with everything necessary. Therefore, we should build modern housing in the Imereti Valley, and we need to think about this here, too. Of course, everything is nearby, people can live in Greater Sochi, but we surely need to think about what can be done here. However, we had the main thing from the very beginning: the training of personnel, our work with these talented children, which should be designed in a way that draws children from all across the country. In fact, this is how Sirius got its start, and it remains our main task. I think Sirius is also able to make a significant contribution to improving the quality of all Russian education, and above all, the primary issue is, of course, teacher qualification. I know that Ms Shmelyova has been working on this for many years. You have created an entire retraining system for teachers here, and in a variety of areas. As far as I know, this work is proceeding quite actively. It is important that not just students and graduates of pedagogical universities come to work in schools, but also mathematicians, physicists, IT specialists, philologists, and historians, that is, future or experienced specialists with in-depth training in a particular field. We have already amended the current laws that allow students to work – regarding both specialised and non-specialised universities. The approaches differ, but they expand the possibilities of involving our young people who are still receiving higher education but who have reached a level where they can share their knowledge with their younger, let us say, partners and schoolchildren. We need to help all these specialists to receive appropriate pedagogical training. And I would ask Sirius to develop and implement such an educational programme in domestic universities. I also consider it necessary for Sirius to coordinate the creation of a network of strong schools with advanced methodology in Russia, and in those areas where powerful technological and industrial growth centres are now being built almost from the ground up. I know that Sirius is working on this, and would like to just note that this area is important, so I am asking you not to lose sight of it. I mean being hands-on with these places and these large projects of ours being created in Russia. For example, the largest gas processing plant in the world, a microelectronics cluster in Valdai, Novgorod Region (I hope it will be created; the first steps are being taken), a biopharmaceutical cluster in the Yaroslavl Region, resort businesses in the Altai Republic, environmentally friendly energy in Kamchatka, the construction of transport and logistics infrastructure in Murmansk, in the Murmansk Region, in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Area, as well as in the key points along the Northern Sea Route. This is, as it were, geographically far from Sirius, but congenial, meaning that large research and production clusters are being created there. If we manage to establish direct contact with these development centres, we will thus make a significant step forward in forming a holistic career trajectory for young people and children who join Sirius at some point and take their first steps here. You are supporting them. Then, there is a university and there are laboratories. If we manage to establish direct interaction with the development clusters, this could be the next step in human development. First, in training the necessary specialists and in developing everyone who wants to work and enjoy success here at home. Next, using the experience and competencies, I would like Sirius to think about creating methodological centres for supporting and cultivating talented children in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions and developing special teacher training programmes. They need this and we must support them. I would like to point out that Russia's principled position on protecting and supporting the people of Donbass does not sit well with many of our partners, but these people really need our support at this point, as I have already said. This must be done based on humanitarian considerations. Here is another point that I would like to make. We are faced with multiple restrictions in sports and even the arts. Of course, we need to promote diverse forms of support for our talented youth, including schoolchildren. What I mean is to hold Olympiads in mathematics, physics and chemistry. Our Ministry and the Government are involved in this. Sirius should step up and help create proper, respectable conditions for hosting events of this kind. By the way, those who want to maintain relations with us, primarily the SCO and BRICS countries, are very interested in Sirius. These are great states populated by billions of people with world-class achievements in many areas. As you are aware, I was here with some of our colleagues, and they were impressed by what they saw here and want to make contacts with Sirius through their ministries, departments, specific schools, universities, and research centres. I think this should be put to good use. I would like to close with this. I am now pleased to turn it over to Ms Shmeleva. Please go ahead. <…> Vladimir Putin: I would like to thank our colleagues for the joint work today. I would like to express my hope that we will continue to do everything to promote Sirius as one of the most important places where we must support our traditional areas, in which we are traditionally leaders, and new areas of activity, for us not only to be at the forefront of success in all these areas, but also to feel the pulse of life in these critical areas, so that all of it benefits Russia, so that we are able to make use of our competitive advantages. As a reminder, Sirius was created as a platform for cultivating talented and promising young schoolchildren, but little by little it is growing in accordance with the demands of the time. As you can see, the university has been created and laboratories are being created. I think we have enough areas to focus on and we do not need any more of them. We need to focus on what we have: the mathematics schools, chemistry schools, other specialised schools, music schools, and choreography schools. All things in which the Soviet Union and Russia have always been and remain undisputed world leaders. Everything that is needed for the future of our country should not only take root in this territory, but also help sustain our intensive development. The conditions here are very good, and we need to use these conditions to the maximum in order to achieve results. Thank you all very much. We will remain in communication with you, keep in touch and promptly respond to emerging challenges so that we can overcome them. I wish you all the best. Thank you very much."

Vladimir Mazur: Good afternoon, Mr President. Vladimir Putin: Mr Mazur, I have seen your impressive work record. You started out as a rank-and-file farmer in Siberia, and you know Siberia very well. It would be no exaggeration to say that you later received a brilliant education and defended a PhD thesis. You have such a large family with five children. These are all your children? Vladimir Mazur: Yes, I have a son, a daughter and triplet daughters. Vladimir Putin: This is great, my congratulations. That is a big achievement in life. To the best of my knowledge, you worked as Deputy Governor of the Tyumen Region, and you headed the administration of Tobolsk. On the whole, you have good knowledge of Siberia. What do you think about the development of the Tomsk Region, which ranks among key Siberian and Russian territories? It has tremendous potential, not to mention its education cluster. Go ahead, please. Vladimir Mazur: Thank you, Mr President. Indeed, the city of Tomsk has a very impressive potential. It is a region of talented and hard-working people, including scientists and farmers tilling high-risk land plots. Of course, my current high-priority tasks include efforts to evaluate the region's socioeconomic development and healthcare system. We need to make people's lives better, more comfortable and safer. Of course, it is now important to focus on the creation of jobs and a new economic potential that the region, without doubt, boasts. Mr President, considering our experience, the people and we will not let you down, and I am confident that we will achieve good results. Vladimir Putin: Good, Mr Mazur.

Pavel Malkov: Good afternoon, Mr President. Vladimir Putin: Mr Malkov, you are a highly experienced person, heading an important business organisation in Moscow. An important feature of your biography is that you served as a deputy prime minister of the Saratov Region Government. This means that you are aware of what real life, a real economy is all about. You also held a post at the Economic Development Ministry of Russia and I am sure you have focused on the Ryazan Region, which is the centre, the heartland of Russia. Please, I would like to hear how you see the region's main problems and development trends. Pavel Malkov: Mr President, of course, I have visited Ryazan on numerous occasions both on official business and for personal needs. It is a very interesting and vibrant region, remarkable for its history, culture, and, of course, people. People are the main priority. The first thing to do is to sort out problems that are of concern for the people and start solving them one by one. In parallel, we will devise a regional development strategy, a vision for positioning the region in the current economic environment. I think about a month will suffice for this purpose. If trust is placed in me, I am ready to report on these proposals. Vladimir Putin: All right. Within a month? Pavel Malkov: Yes, sir. Vladimir Putin: Good. Then it is a deal.

Alexander Sokolov: Good afternoon, Mr President. Vladimir Putin: Mr Sokolov, you had such a noble start to your career, as an after-school teacher. Alexander Sokolov: Yes indeed, it was a page in my career. Vladimir Putin: After that, as I see, you showed vigorous growth, and eventually earned a MGIMO degree. It was MGIMO, wasn't it? Alexander Sokolov: Yes, I have a master's from MGIMO. I started out as a history teacher. I have teacher's diploma. After doing my practicum, I was offered a position in one of the schools in my home town in the Kostroma Region. I was a fifth-year student, and tried it. I think that helped me in the future, because communication with people, communication with children is very important. Vladimir Putin: Yes. Mr Sokolov, what were your duties as first deputy governor of the Kostroma Region? Alexander Sokolov: I was a deputy in charge of domestic policy. In addition, I oversaw culture, cultural heritage and youth affairs. Domestic policy also involves interaction with all municipalities, political parties and public organisations. Vladimir Putin: I see. The Kirov Region also has major industrial facilities, with good prospects, as well as resources. Have you looked at this? Have you got an idea of the main areas of work? Alexander Sokolov: Yes. My duties now include interaction with regional authorities, so of course, I am studying the regions, and I have looked at the Kirov Region. I cannot say that I know of every problem the region is facing, but as I understand, it has a developed timber industry, industrial enterprises and heavy industry. There is good experience in agriculture and construction. I think that together with the people who work there, together with entrepreneurs, together with the heads of municipalities, we will be able to resolve many issues. Vladimir Putin: Yes, you just mentioned the right things: together with the people who work there. And Mr Sokolov, you will need to know by heart both the region's problems and its promising areas for development, of course. I very much hope you will cooperate with your colleagues who work there, and with the relevant government agencies here in Moscow– this should be the easy part for you, with your experience in the Executive Office– you will need to study every aspect properly, and then, in cooperation with the Government and with your colleagues on the ground, in the Kirov Region, to outline the region's development goals. Alexander Sokolov: Of course, Mr President. Vladimir Putin: And ways to achieve these goals, of course. Alexander Sokolov: Yes. You are so right about relying on the local people. Local initiative coming from the people is important, and in the Kirov Region, the people are both enterprising and, what is also very important, extremely patriotic– both in relation to Russia and to their native region. I see this as an important resource for development. Vladimir Putin: This is true. All right, Mr Sokolov. We will talk more and get back to these matters. Thank you and good luck. Alexander Sokolov: Thank you."

Yury Zaitsev: Good afternoon, Mr President. Vladimir Putin: Mr Zaitsev, I have looked at the documents about your professional experience. You are from the Moscow Region, and you have a good education, serious education, and a long work record. Of course, your current post as head of the Government of Kalmykia is a high position that implies many responsibilities. You also know the republic where you will now be appointed to work. Mr Zaitsev, I would like you to tell me, after you have considered the situation in Mari El, what you consider to be the most important issues and which of them should be given priority attention. Go ahead, please. Yury Zaitsev: Thank you, Mr President. To date, I have analysed the main parameters of the republic. I have formed a general picture, and I would like to tell you the following about what I plan to do in the region first of all. The socioeconomic situation is very important: how people live, what they want and what problems they are facing. When I form this vision and translate it into a comprehensive action programme, I will be ready to present it to you, to tell you what I plan to do to improve the region, possibly in person, if I may. In principle, Kalmykia and Mari El are similar in some respects, notably, the economy, and the difference in their budgets is relatively small. Therefore, I hope to form an understanding of the situation rather quickly. Vladimir Putin: Good. Mr Zaitsev, I think it was a slip of the tongue when you said that it is important to know how people live. It is in fact the most important thing. Yury Zaitsev: Mr President, I fully agree with you on this. Vladimir Putin: Yes, it is the main issue. When you know how people live, what needs they have and what is lacking in their lives now, you will be able to formulate your development plans based on this knowledge. I sincerely hope that you will do this quickly and report on this to me. Agreed? Yury Zaitsev: I certainly will, Mr President. Vladimir Putin: Good. Yury Zaitsev: Thank you very much."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68373,Meeting on fire-fighting efforts,2022-05-10T14:10:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin held a videoconference meeting on fire-fighting efforts in a number of Russian regions.,"The meeting was attended by Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Anton Vaino, deputy prime ministers Viktoria Abramchenko, Tatyana Golikova, Marat Khusnullin, Deputy Prime Minister – Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoy to the Far Eastern Federal District Yury Trutnev, Presidential Aide Maxim Oreshkin, Minister of Natural Resources and Environment Alexander Kozlov, Minister of Agriculture Dmitry Patrushev, Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov, Minister of Energy Nikolai Shulginov, Acting Minister for Civil Defence, Emergencies and Natural Disaster Relief Alexander Chupriyan, Special Presidential Representative for Environmental Protection, Ecology and Transport Sergei Ivanov, and heads of several regions and federal agencies. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues. Today we will discuss the situation concerning fires in Russia and revisit the range of issues related to the prevention of forest fires. It is important to have an in-depth discussion and take additional action, if necessary, to alleviate the current problems. Generally, we should discuss improving the fire prevention efforts. At the moment, several regions are fighting fires in residential places, with significant material damage becoming apparent. Unfortunately, victims have been reported as well. I am talking about wildfires, landscape and man-caused fires. Regardless of their origin, these fires pose a direct threat to people's lives and health, causing tangible and often irreparable harm to nature and wildlife, as well as adversely impacting the economy and social life. Colleagues, I would like to ask the Acting Emergencies Minister to start the meeting with his report on the current situation. Governors of the Krasnoyarsk Territory, the Kemerovo Region, the Omsk Region and the Kurgan Region, please report on the state of affairs in your regions. I have already discussed the matter with several colleagues, and I believe it is necessary to have a discussion involving a broader range of participants. Please tell us what kind of additional help you require from the federal government and report on what kind of assistance is provided to local residents. Please note that we must not allow a repetition of the situation last year, when the wildfires were the longest and most intense in several years. Fire management requires a complete overhaul where it is necessary. I will tell you later what decisions have already been made. Still, if we see that something is not working or is not sufficiently effective, changes must be made. Firefighting efforts must be more efficient, better organised and consistent, with all preventive measures being raised to a higher standard. I have already spoken about the substantial damage that fire causes to our citizens, the economy, the social sphere and wildlife. There is another extremely important aspect. I have already noted – and everybody understands this – that forests act as an environmental shield for our country and the entire planet. This plays a key role in absorbing global greenhouse emissions. Therefore, large-scale fires undermine our climate change efforts. This is a matter of principal importance for our country and the entire world. I want to stress that, as I have just said, all the decisions necessary for effective action against wildfires were made at the federal level in the past. For example, the law specifies the authority, responsibilities and liability of government bodies and forest land lessees when it comes to eliminating fires and restoring forests. The law also regulates matters concerning landscape fires, which are fires breaking out on open land, in fields, meadows and steppes and which often spread to forests. Since January 1, 2022, regional and municipal authorities have been responsible for eliminating such fires. As per your request, funding is being allocated. As part of the Environment national project, the regions are upgrading specialised fire-fighting equipment. The main issue that representatives of our federal constituent entities have been raising repeatedly is insufficient funding for the wildfire fighting effort. I understand that this matter has been resolved. In this context, I would like to note an important decision made following the XX Congress of the United Russia party, which instructed the Government to additionally allocate at least 8 billion rubles every year to regional authorities for wildfire prevention efforts. These funds were calculated and agreed upon with the constituent entities and fully included in the federal budget for this year and for the planned period of 2023–2024. Essentially, the regional officials currently have all the necessary authority, equipment and funding to prevent wildfires. Clearly, it is a complicated issue as force of nature is force of nature. But today I would like to hear from you: are you making use of the funds that were allocated? And what is preventing you today from promptly responding to new fires? I would like to stress once again: all the proposals from the constituent entities have been supported and money allocated. Tell me if this is not the case but as I understand it, the federal centre has created all the conditions for you to reduce the area of active fires multiple times and ensure that they are eliminated quickly and effectively. It is the responsibility of the regions to achieve that. Again, it is the heads of regions who are in charge of ensuring that fires are extinguished. When the situation gets out of control, you must not keep it to yourself. This is why this board is meeting today, to speak openly. You are to request assistance as promptly as possible. Senior officials of the federal government bodies and specifically the Emergencies Ministry must note that a well-coordinated wildfire response system must be built and operate, while involving additional funding, equipment and workforce must not be just a formality. If there is a real threat of a fire spreading, help must arrive – for the respective region or municipality – immediately and not just formally. It is important to assess the real threat, potential risks and to use the forces and means where they are most needed – and, I should stress, regardless of the subordination of a specific territory or land. At this point, I would like to hear detailed reports from the heads of Yakutia, the Trans-Baikal Territory and the Irkutsk Region, which had the biggest wildfires last year, on how the decisions on this issue have been implemented, how the allocated funds were used and how it affected the territories' preparedness for the risks in this year's fire season. And I would like to know how the number of wildfires can be reduced this year and in the future, given the resources and capabilities provided. I would also like the Minister of Natural Resources and Environment to comment on the reports by the heads of the constituent entities of the Federation and to report on the systemic steps to drastically change the situation. I would also like to add that I think it is necessary to set a benchmark to assess both the efficiency of this effort and a specific result, that is, a decrease in the wildfire-affected areas of each constituent entity of the Federation and in the country in general. I suggest we include this indicator in the presidential executive order to be drafted following today's meeting. Let's think about, of course, what other items the executive order should include to be more effective. Let me stress that this document is to objectively assess the efficiency of the steps taken to protect our forests from fires as well as the efforts of the regions of the Federation and the Government in this area. An extremely important issue is rebuilding residential structures. I talked to some colleagues today – tentatively, some 700 buildings that had been used by people as permanent residence and that were destroyed by fire, need to be rebuilt. I am not talking about dachas, that is a separate subject. Let's get to work. Head of the Emergencies Ministry Alexander Chupriyan has the floor. Go ahead please, Mr Chupriyan. <…> Vladimir Putin: This is what I would like to say in conclusion. There are several aspects, traditional ones, but we have been improving the results from year to year. I hope this will eventually bring a positive outcome, despite climate change. What I would like to emphasise is, first of all, the restoration of housing. (Addressing Marat Khusnullin) Mr Khusnullin, I would like to ask you to join in these efforts, if the assistance of the federal government becomes necessary. Of course, this issue should be addressed above all at the regional level with support from municipalities. But if federal assistance is necessary, I would like to ask Russia's construction sector to contribute and to respond accordingly. The second issue concerns payments. This is very important, especially for those who have lost everything, who have lost their personal belongings and their properties, who have become homeless. We must organise these payments, and this must be done quickly, without undue administrative red tape, especially since many people have lost their documents as well, as we all know. The next issue has to do with children. We must do all we can to help organise summer holidays for the children in the families which have been affected by these fires, at the regional, and if necessary, federal levels – I am addressing this to Ms Golikova. Next, the relevant commission must start working now. One of the main tasks is to address the evaluation of one square metre of housing realistically, because prices differ from region to region, and we must take this into account to determine the necessary funding. Incidentally, some of our regional colleagues, as we have learned now, do not need federal assistance in this matter, despite the large amount of housing which they are repairing or will need to rebuild, as our regional colleagues have indicated in their reports. Some of them said they are managing on their own, while others said they need our assistance. This matter must be clarified as soon as possible. As for consumer loans, of course, we should consider what can be done, and how much funding can be allocated to help the people in terms of their mortgages and other loans. A relevant Presidential executive order must be prepared to ensure so that we do not forget about this issue and so that proposals are made on amending the regulatory framework. (Addressing Viktoria Abramchenko) Ms Abramchenko, I would like to ask you, together with the Presidential Executive Office, to prepare a draft executive order without any delay and to submit it to me for signature. Thank you, and all the best."

The President presented to Artem Zhoga the Star of the Hero of Russia awarded to his son posthumously.*** President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Zhoga, today is May 9, Victory Day. I present to you the Star of the Hero for your son. Sadly, he is no longer with us, he has departed our ranks, yet he lived a bright and beautiful life and died a hero, literally shielding with his body women and children, his countrymen, compatriots. He gave his life for the Motherland. You have my condolences for the loss of your son, but I also congratulate you on raising a true hero, really. It is my wish that this Star of the Hero remains in your family forever. Artem Zhoga: Thank you very much, Mr President. Vladimir earned this decoration with all of his actions. The entire eight years– yes, it has been eight years already, he joined a militia on May 2, 2014, before that we used to help the guys who came to us, the Strelkov garrison. He devoted himself completely to the cause. Indeed, how I raised him had an effect since I grew up when we all honoured our heroes and the memory of our grandfathers. My grandfather is a Great Patriotic War veteran, he finished the war in Koenigsberg as a senior sergeant, he was an artillery forward observer. Volodya, as it turned out, became a reconnaissance office too, not artillery, but а reconnaissance trooper, a battalion commander. We will make every effort to see our cause through, so that victory is ours. We will win, we will do everything we need to. God willing, we will not lose more friends and family, so that the victory is much less costly. But victory will be ours regardless. Thank you very much for your support. February 24 is a great day. Yes, it may be terrible in one respect because hostilities began, both civilians and soldiers are dying. Servicemen of the Russian Federation, our entire big country Russia, the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics, the militias. But in another respect it was exactly this step, this day, this action, getting out of a terrible suspended situation, the resolution of this entire conflict. Thank you very much– I would like to say that on behalf of my battalion, of the 1st Army Corps[DPR], and all the people of the Donetsk People's Republic. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: If there had been any chance to resolve this problem through other, peaceful means, we would have certainly taken it. But we were not given a chance, there was no other option. Our men are fighting courageously, heroically and professionally. All plans are being carried out. The result will be achieved. There is no doubt about it. My congratulation to you on Victory Day and to your son on the Star of the Hero. Artem Zhoga: Thank you. And to you as well. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. <…>"

The commander of the parade was Commander-in-Chief of the Ground Forces, Army General Oleg Salyukov. The parade featured 11,000 servicemembers and 131 pieces of military equipment. The column marching through Red Square comprised 33 parade units of officers, sergeants and soldiers of all branches of the Armed Forces, personnel of other security, defence and law enforcement agencies, cadets and students of military academies, Young Army members and Cossacks. The parade column of female servicemembers included cadets of six military educational institutions this year: the Military University, the Military Academy of Communications, the Military Logistics Academy, the Military-Space Academy, the Military Air and Space Defence Academy, and the Military Academy of Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Protection (NBC Protection Military Academy). The mechanised column, headed by the legendary Т-34–85 Victory Tank, featured Taifun-K, Taifun-VDV and Tigr-M armoured vehicles, BMP-2 Berezhok, BMP-3 and Kurganets-25 infantry fighting vehicles, T-72B3M, Т-90М Proryv and the latest Т-14 Armata tanks, Tornado-G rocket systems, Iskander-M operational tactical missile systems, S-400 Triumf, Buk-M3 and Tor-M2 air defence systems, and Yars strategic systems driving over the cobblestone paving of Red Square. Uran-9 strike robots were carried on truck beds. * * * Address by the President of Russia at the military parade President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Fellow Russian citizens, Dear veterans, Comrade soldiers and seamen, sergeants and sergeant majors, midshipmen and warrant officers, Comrade officers, generals and admirals, I congratulate you on the Day of Great Victory! The defence of our Motherland when its destiny was at stake has always been sacred. It was the feeling of true patriotism that Minin and Pozharsky's militia stood up for the Fatherland, soldiers went on the offensive at the Borodino Field and fought the enemy outside Moscow and Leningrad, Kiev and Minsk, Stalingrad and Kursk, Sevastopol and Kharkov. Today, as in the past, you are fighting for our people in Donbass, for the security of our Motherland, for Russia. May 9, 1945 has been enshrined in world history forever as a triumph of the united Soviet people, its cohesion and spiritual power, an unparalleled feat on the front lines and on the home front. Victory Day is intimately dear to all of us. There is no family in Russia that was not burnt by the Great Patriotic War. Its memory never fades. On this day, children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the heroes march in an endless flow of the Immortal Regiment. They carry photos of their family members, the fallen soldiers who remained young forever, and the veterans who are already gone. We take pride in the unconquered courageous generation of the victors, we are proud of being their successors, and it is our duty to preserve the memory of those who defeated Nazism and entrusted us with being vigilant and doing everything to thwart the horror of another global war. Therefore, despite all controversies in international relations, Russia has always advocated the establishment of an equal and indivisible security system which is critically needed for the entire international community. Last December we proposed signing a treaty on security guarantees. Russia urged the West to hold an honest dialogue in search for meaningful and compromising solutions, and to take account of each other's interests. All in vain. NATO countries did not want to heed us, which means they had totally different plans. And we saw it. Another punitive operation in Donbass, an invasion of our historic lands, including Crimea, was openly in the making. Kiev declared that it could attain nuclear weapons. The NATO bloc launched an active military build-up on the territories adjacent to us. Thus, an absolutely unacceptable threat to us was steadily being created right on our borders. There was every indication that a clash with neo-Nazis and Banderites backed by the United States and their minions was unavoidable. Let me repeat, we saw the military infrastructure being built up, hundreds of foreign advisors starting work, and regular supplies of cutting-edge weaponry being delivered from NATO countries. The threat grew every day. Russia launched a pre-emptive strike at the aggression. It was a forced, timely and the only correct decision. A decision by a sovereign, strong and independent country. The United States began claiming their exceptionalism, particularly after the collapse of the Soviet Union, thus denigrating not just the entire world but also their satellites, who have to pretend not to see anything, and to obediently put up with it. But we are a different country. Russia has a different character. We will never give up our love for our Motherland, our faith and traditional values, our ancestors' customs and respect for all peoples and cultures. Meanwhile, the West seems to be set to cancel these millennia-old values. Such moral degradation underlies the cynical falsifications of World War II history, escalating Russophobia, praising traitors, mocking their victims' memory and crossing out the courage of those who won the Victory through suffering. We are aware that US veterans who wanted to come to the parade in Moscow were actually forbidden to do so. But I want them to know: We are proud of your deeds and your contribution to our common Victory. We honour all soldiers of the allied armies – the Americans, the English, the French, Resistance fighters, brave soldiers and partisans in China – all those who defeated Nazism and militarism. Comrades, Donbass militia alongside with the Russian Army are fighting on their land today, where princes Svyatoslav and Vladimir Monomakh's retainers, solders under the command of Rumyantsev and Potemkin, Suvorov and Brusilov crushed their enemies, where Great Patriotic War heroes Nikolai Vatutin, Sidor Kovpak and Lyudmila Pavlichenko stood to the end. I am addressing our Armed Forces and Donbass militia. You are fighting for our Motherland, its future, so that nobody forgets the lessons of World War II, so that there is no place in the world for torturers, death squads and Nazis. Today, we bow our heads to the sacred memory of all those who lost their lives in the Great Patriotic War, the memories of the sons, daughters, fathers, mothers, grandfathers, husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, relatives and friends. We bow our heads to the memory of the Odessa martyrs who were burned alive in the House of Trade Unions in May 2014, to the memory of the old people, women and children of Donbass who were killed in atrocious and barbaric shelling by neo-Nazis. We bow our heads to our fighting comrades who died a brave death in the righteous battle – for Russia. I declare a minute of silence. (A minute of silence.) The loss of each officer and soldier is painful for all of us and an irretrievable loss for the families and friends. The government, regional authorities, enterprises and public organisations will do everything to wrap such families in care and help them. Special support will be given to the children of the killed and wounded comrades-in-arms. The Presidential Executive Order to this effect was signed today. I wish a speedy recovery to the wounded soldiers and officers, and I thank doctors, paramedics, nurses and staff of military hospitals for their selfless work. Our deepest gratitude goes to you for saving each life, oftentimes sparing no thought for yourselves under shelling on the frontlines. Comrades, Soldiers and officers from many regions of our enormous Motherland, including those who arrived straight from Donbass, from the combat area, are standing now shoulder-to-shoulder here, on Red Square. We remember how Russia's enemies tried to use international terrorist gangs against us, how they tried to seed inter-ethnic and religious strife so as to weaken us from within and divide us. They failed completely. Today, our warriors of different ethnicities are fighting together, shielding each other from bullets and shrapnel like brothers. This is where the power of Russia lies, a great invincible power of our united multi-ethnic nation. You are defending today what your fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers fought for. The wellbeing and security of their Motherland was their top priority in life. Loyalty to our Fatherland is the main value and a reliable foundation of Russia's independence for us, their successors, too. Those who crushed Nazism during the Great Patriotic War showed us an example of heroism for all ages. This is the generation of victors, and we will always look up to them. Glory to our heroic Armed Forces! For Russia! For Victory! Hooray!"

Gas supply in the region, construction of the Western Bridge in Tver, and development of the Zavidovo resort were discussed.","The governor stressed the importance of gas supply in the Tver Region. The programme for this was organised with the active participation of the Government, in line with the President's instructions; it is worth more than 20 billion rubles in monetary terms. The implementation began in 2022 with the support of Gazprom. All municipal facilities and all regional property and social facilities – schools, hospitals, kindergartens, libraries, and sports centres – will have gas by 2025, with Russian-made materials used in the gas supply programme: pipes are produced in the Tver Region, among other things. Igor Rudenya noted how important it was to implement the decision adopted in line with the President's instructions on additional gas supply and connecting households free of charge. Now 6,900 households are getting additional gas supply. The Governor also noted that the gas supply will provide an opportunity to attract new investment, create new jobs in the non-budgetary sector, and increase the competitiveness of enterprises. Answering Vladimir Putin's question about the construction of the bridge, the governor said that it was an excellent project for which local people are grateful to the President. The large project includes three bridges: the main bridge across the Volga, which is 2,900 metres long with six lanes, as well as two additional flyovers across the Oktyabrskaya railway; and the reconstruction of the railway bridge, with the main Oktyabrskaya railway line. Accordingly, another, fourth bridge was added, in order to avoid a collapse at the exit to the St Petersburg Motorway. Igor Rudenya spoke about the investment project to develop the Zavidovo resort. Today, there are two hotels and a camping site there, and two large water parks of international stature and two hotels are under construction with the support of the Government and Rostourism. In addition to this, the governor reported that the port had already been built. The water area and quay wall have been completed. The foundation of the river port passenger station is planned after the May holidays. It will be made in the Stalin-era Empire style, and the region has proposed making it the starting point of tourist routes along the Volga. It is planned that the tourist season will start there in 2024. All types of vessels will be able to enter the port. Igor Rudenya suggested to the President establishing a large museum at the Rzhev memorial to the Soviet soldier built on the site of bloody battles near Rzhev in 1942–1943. In 2020, President of Russia Vladimir Putin and President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko participated in the unveiling of the memorial. The governor said that if the President supported the museum project, it would be implemented by the 80th anniversary of the Great Victory in 2025."

They paid special attention to humanitarian issues, including the evacuation of civilians held by militants of nationalist battalions from the Azovstal steel plant, in cooperation with representatives of the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross. As before, the Russian military is ready to ensure the safe exit of civilians. As for the remaining militants at the Azovstal plant, the Kiev authorities should order them to lay down arms. On the eve of Victory Day in the Great Patriotic War, which Russia and Israel celebrate on 9 May, Vladimir Putin and Naftali Bennett emphasised the special importance of this date for the people of both countries, who carefully preserve the historical truth about the events of those years and honour the memory of all the fallen, including the victims of the Holocaust. The President of Russia recalled that of the six million Jews tortured in ghettoes and death camps and killed by the Nazis during punitive operations, 40 percent were Soviet citizens, and asked Naftali Bennett to convey wishes of good health and wellbeing to the war veterans in Israel. In turn, Naftali Bennett highlighted the Red Army's decisive contribution to the Victory over Nazism."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68355,Meeting with Director General of the Znaniye Society Maxim Dreval,2022-05-05T14:05:00Z,NA,Vladimir Putin had a meeting with Director General of the Znaniye (Knowledge) Society Maxim Dreval in the Kremlin.,"Znaniye(Knowledge) Society, a public educational organisation, was established by Presidential Executive Order in 2015.*** President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Dreval, let's talk about the revived Znaniye Society. How long has it been functioning in this new capacity? Director General of the Znaniye Society Maxim Dreval: It may be symbolic that, as per your instruction, the society was revived one year ago. Vladimir Putin: Are you satisfied with the results of its performance over the past 12 months? Maxim Dreval: I must say it exceeded our boldest expectations. The most important thing is the young people's response. We knew that there was great demand, but we could not expect to involve over 40 million people in a year, especially since we are dealing with complicated educational content in such areas as science, technology, Russian history, culture and geography. Vladimir Putin: This turned out to be a good niche. Maxim Dreval: Yes, the project has received over 400 million views, and this is what we were able to calculate. Today, the most popular subject has to do with new opportunities and new horizons that are opening up in all spheres. This is why we organised this event, and we are now holding it on a regular basis. Thousands of experts, scientists, businesspeople, cultural figures, artists and government officials spoke at schools, shared their knowledge with students and discussed new opportunities with them. A time of changes and challenges always spells new opportunities. Speaking of opportunities, we realise that it is very important to rely on history and its experience and lessons. Consequently, the subject of history has always been and remains a key aspect. Another project deals with the age of Peter the Great, marking his 350th birth anniversary. Under this project, the entire country will host a series of events called Russia is My History in local parks. Everyone will watch a cycle of lectures about Peter the Great that we are filming together with your aide, Vladimir Medinsky. At the same time, it is important that Znaniye is not just launching its lectures and events trying to cover the entire country but that systematic work has been established with all ministries, large companies, universities, and public organisations. For example, now Znaniye attends all large events held in Russia, such as the St Petersburg Economic Forum and the Eastern Economic Forum. We organise joint thematic marathons. For example, we held a marathon with Roscosmos on April 12, and one on science and technology with Rosatom; we regularly hold joint events on ICT with the VKontakte[social network]. Going back to history and new opportunities, we dedicated large, perhaps the largest educational marathon, which will be held in May this year and which has already become traditional, to the topic of new opportunities, new horizons and the role of Russia in the world. Mr President, I would like to use this occasion to invite you to once again attend the Znaniye marathon and hold an open lesson for children. It will take place on May 17–19, for three days, across the entire country, and there will be some outstanding speakers. We would be very grateful if you could find time to hold such an open lesson. Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much for the invitation. I will be sure to check my schedule. Maxim Dreval: Thank you very much. Speaking about cooperation with ministries, there is a very indicative and interesting project. We have launched a contest of educational plays, the best of which Znaniye will stage together with a professional director and, moreover, will help school and student theatre groups to hold them on their own. This project was inspired by 17-year-old Liza Kochetkova. Together with other kids she staged a play on bulling. When watching this play we felt and realised how even amateur actors, teenagers, could show a very important topic so deeply. It became clear that Znaniye should definitely add such a format, too. Another new format that was inspired by young people is gaming, because young people have always wanted an entertaining education process, the process of game. Last year we held an experimental online quiz for the entire country. It was the largest quiz in the history of Russia; it even made it to the book of records. Inspired by such results, we decided to hold a full-fledged championship that would be held all year round, and called it The League of Knowledge. Now we are adding various other formats of competitions, and we are even thinking of broadcasting the finals on television in order to further encourage the participants and once again show that knowledge has fundamental value for our country. Naturally, the reboot would be impossible without our lecturers, who played a huge role in this work. Now there are more than 8,000 lecturers in Znaniye, and we expect this number to increase to 15,000 this year. At the same time, it all started with 300 people, Mr President. I am very grateful to them for their dedication and willingness to share their knowledge. We have actively expanded the lecturer community, by first of all, adding teachers and instructors. But, you know, we noticed that not only professional lecturers, but also people in all fields were ready to share their knowledge. Moreover, young people also wanted real examples of the experience of professionals from various fields. We launched the League of Lecturers contest, which has helped us to find talented educators from all over the country. Over 10,000 people have already taken part in the contest. So we have found film directors, engineers and programmers to give lectures. For example, a military commissar became a semi-finalist. He reconstructs the history of soldiers' heroic deeds during the Great Patriotic War, based on archival materials. So, we attract various lecturers. Vladimir Putin: What was the contest based on? What did the winner get? Maxim Dreval: The contest is held twice a year, so for six months, participants speak online to an audience made up of various age groups; they are judged by the young people and our experts. Then they take part in the semi-finals in their region, at our partner universities and at various venues, and for the final, they come to Moscow to speak in the main Moscow universities, and they are also assessed by experts and young people. This is a rather complex selection process. Vladimir Putin: How many people reach the final? Maxim Dreval: There are 100 finalists and 50 winners. And they all receive our grant support, training and tools to create and promote educational content. We consider it very important not only to find them and give them an audience, but also to really help them develop. In fact, we meet a lot of talented educators who, and this is very important now, want not only to share knowledge and speak, but also to create content that will be distributed on the internet to a large audience. I believe that now this is especially important, when there are so many fakes, when there is a lot of low-quality information. Vladimir Putin: Certainly. Maxim Dreval: We are trying to find out how to help more than fifty, more than a hundred such winners, including financially, so that they can create more content and reach audiences. Now we are also looking for such an opportunity; if you offer support, we will look more actively, we will find such an opportunity. Vladimir Putin: Of course, objective, important and meaningful information, especially when delivered in a talented and fascinating way, is in great demand because Wikipedia alone is not enough. Maxim Dreval: I totally agree. Vladimir Putin: We know the quality of this information. It is worth a lot when there are talented people, professionals whose opinion can be trusted. They are like live encyclopaedias. Maxim Dreval: Absolutely. And, by the way, in fact, Znaniye is creating a knowledge database that in many respects will be able to serve as an alternative to Wikipedia, only with accurate data and reputable authors. By the way, when we created the community of lecturers, young people wanted to see real examples of success stories about people that the country is proud of, the most prominent people in our country. This chimes with what you said at the first Znaniye marathon, when you mentioned that among the lecturers there should be CEOs, governors, Government members and the most prominent people from all areas of knowledge. Thank you, Mr President, for your active involvement in the work of Znaniye and the open lesson you held in Vladivostok; your example inspired many people. I am happy that today we have governors, Government members and outstanding people from all areas among our lecturers. I hope that it will become a tradition, and those who have not joined us yet will do so soon. By the way, it is also important that these meetings with such unique people are always a dialogue and not a monologue. We can see how important live communication is for young people, so that children can always ask their questions at all Znaniye events, whether online or offline. Moreover, we provide this opportunity even at events that are not held by us. For instance, at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, moderators put questions to the speakers that we had asked children in advance. That is, we give children the chance, through Znaniye, to pose questions to the leading experts at all the forums in our country. By the way, experts often tell us that it is sometimes more difficult to answer children's questions than questions from their colleagues. I know what they mean, and, as a matter of fact, when I hear these questions I realise how sincere, smart and talented these kids are. I am proud of our young people. I can also add that their questions essentially make them the co-authors of the content that Znaniye creates. They direct the experts and lecturers who give the knowledge that the children need right now. Another interesting format is lecture tours. Last year, we tried to meet with a unique person at a unique place. For instance, Dmitry Rogozin spoke about space and the ambitious projects by Roscosmos at the Vostochny Space Centre. Also children spoke about music with Valery Gergiyev in the Mariinsky Theatre; Dmitry Artyukhov talked about the Arctic aboard an icebreaker in the Kara Sea. There have been more than 50 such lecture tours where kids have been able to meet lecturers, both in person and online, because all this is filmed and broadcast, and our young people can immerse themselves… Vladimir Putin: As if they had visited the place. Maxim Dreval: Exactly. We thought about how to surprise the young people when we held the second marathon at the St Petersburg Forum, and we moved our audience to unique places in St Petersburg, namely, the Mariinsky Theatre. It is a great way to involve young people. And for us it is very important that we don't just show them a video or content about a particular topic, but rather captivate them so that they will be interested in studying the subject in more depth. By the way, the project More Than a Journey has become a next step after the lecture tours format, which has helped young people to visit various places all over Russia and also to learn more about the history of the region, famous people who were born there and the region's achievements. I think it is very important for young people, for us, and for the country as a whole, that young people get to know the country, its achievements and its prominent people. In the past year, Znaniye has created over 600 hours of educational content. It is rather complicated and intellectual content. To create more and cover the entire country, we have opened nine studios in all the federal districts. This helps us to reach interesting people, lecturers from all over the country, and to create content about various regions. At the same time because we want to give authors the chance to create their own content and help them to do this, we together with the Ministry of Science and Higher Education and the Ministry of Education, are launching media laboratories at universities. These will become a platform where authors can create their own content with the use of the laboratory equipment, and receive help from our team and, very importantly, with access to the huge library of Znaniye and our partners' content create their own videos and films. We give them access to this free of charge, because creating educational content is the most important thing. We want dozens or maybe even hundreds of such media laboratories to be launched this year and next. I am sure that there will be much more content, it will be created not only by Znaniye but by a huge number of such educators. We've even gone into professional content– into cinema, and we've just launched a project called Smart Films, which is running a documentary scripts competition. I hope that more than 30 new documentaries will appear this year. We help aspiring documentary filmmakers, including with an educational programme. And most importantly, besides the grant support from partners that encourages filmmaking, we have the backing of certain platforms and cinemas so that these films can really find their audience. Vladimir Putin: What do you use as a basis, where are you carrying this out? Maxim Dreval: The competition takes place all over the country. The best of them come to Moscow, and we introduce them to the leading film studios. Budding documentary filmmakers undergo a training programme there and choose a studio where they want to film. We have a good partner: Gorky Film Studios. They are always ready to help everyone to produce these documentaries. But teams can choose any studio, as long as the script wins and the film is a documentary, an educational one. All these films are guaranteed to find their audience, because both online and offline cinemas are with us. Vladimir Putin: Who helps you to work with the studios? Maxim Dreval: The Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Education and the studios all responded. It didn't take much persuasion. Actually they really needed it. And it is very significant that many companies have supported it in terms of grants. These include commercial companies, such as VK, which gladly supported our initiative, Yandex, Sberbank and the Internet Development Institute Foundation. A lot of organisations supported this initiative because, firstly, many of them also own cinemas, and they are interested in these kinds of films emerging, and the idea of enlightenment is not alien to them, in principle. The executives of these companies are our lecturers. Vladimir Putin: Understood. What else needs to be done to support this project? Maxim Dreval: Your participation as a lecturer always gives a very strong impetus. The second most important aspect, in my view, where we can and should expand, is grant support for lecturers and educators, enabling them to create content, and we are now looking for means to expand this kind of grant support. Another thought, or rather a request from the audience and our thoughts on this. They often ask us why our content has not yet appeared on television. Maybe we really should think about getting films, game formats, lectures, content about geography, about the country's history appear on TV channels more often. If you support us, we will work with our colleagues from the TV channels so that our educational content appears on television too. Vladimir Putin: Agreed. Maxim Dreval: Thank you very much. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68351,Meeting with Minister of Labour and Social Protection Anton Kotyakov,2022-05-04T13:50:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region","Vladimir Putin met with the Minister of Labour and Social Protection. Anton Kotyakov reported to the President on the efforts to improve the labour market and other social support measures, including for families with children and disabled people.","Minister Kotyakov reported that the current situation in the labour market was stable. About 3.1 million people are classified as unemployed, and that number is not growing. Some 675,000 people are registered at employment centres that now have about 1.9 million openings. Anton Kotyakov told the President about a package of measures to support the labour market. There is a 24-hour hotline to allow people to ask questions about labour rights protection. Even during the pandemic, information was collected from employers on changes in work formats and employee tables. Employment centres have been converted to a proactive format. As soon as information is received that a company is having employment issues, employment centre staff immediately visit the company and provide information on support for the company owner and their personnel. Right then, they can work out a plan for company participation in different programmes. The Minister told the President in detail about these programmes, in part, on retraining employees for new technical processes, organising temporary assignments or transferring employees from one company to another. About 345,000 people are to undergo retraining. Special attention is devoted to young people. There is a system for monitoring employment after graduation. Graduate registries are compared with information in the work record e-books at the Pension Fund. This shows what jobs graduates received and how much they make. There are also ratings for education programmes for both universities and vocational secondary schools. The Government has launched a programme for subsidising employers that hire young people. In general, the Ministry plans to support about 1.5 million people under these programmes. The federal budget has allocated over 90 billion rubles for this purpose. The Minister also talked about an integrated support system for families with children that was created upon the President's instructions. This system covers families with children up to 3 years old and families with children aged 3 to 7. Last year, two additional measures were introduced regarding children 8 to 17 from single-parent families and additional support measures for expectant mothers. On May 1, an additional state support measure was introduced for children 8 to 17 from complete but low-income families. The system will cover more than 10 million children. The total spending for this system will amount to 1.2 trillion rubles per year. The Social Treasury project is underway. The key principle is to provide services to citizens proactively and based on just one request. Today, the most popular services include the provision of social support in the event of difficult life situations. If a person agrees to receive information about possible support measures in the event of a particular situation, then the necessary information on available support measures is sent to their personal account. The procedure for establishing disability status was also covered. The President underscored that this was important for millions of citizens. Kotyakov said that over 11 million people with disabilities live in Russia, of whom about 730,000 are children with disabilities. It was critically important, he said, to alter the very approach to determining disability for a particular person and to simplify it as much as possible. The mechanism for remote medical exams has been tested on the basis of the data that patients receive in a medical organisation. As of now, 50 percent of public health institutions are sending information about the necessary tests in electronic form. The information goes to the patient's personal account on the government services website, including customised rehabilitation programmes. The Minister spoke about the social service coverage of senior citizens and citizens with disabilities. The President instructed the Ministry of Labour to expand the list of available support measures and to develop additional tools. As of late 2021, 6.7 million people were covered by various support tools with 6.8 million citizens to be covered in 2022. About 300,000 people are living in nursing homes and are covered by corresponding programmes. As planned, about 2.1 million people will be covered by at-home programmes, that is, a social worker will come to see them; 4.4 million people receive social services at rehabilitation centres, social service centres and as part of active ageing programmes. Vladimir Putin noted that this was also important and asked the Minister to keep it under constant control."

The two presidents continued their exchange of opinions on the situation in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin informed his French counterpart about the progress of the special military operation to protect the Donbass republics, including the liberation of Mariupol and the evacuation of the civilians retained by nationalists at the Azovstal plant, with the evacuation proceeding as agreed during the April 26 meeting between Vladimir Putin and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. During the conversation, it was noted that the EU member countries ignore the crimes committed by the Ukrainian forces, and massive shelling of cities and communities in the Donbass region resulting in civilian casualties. The West could help stop these atrocities by influencing the Kiev government, as well as stopping arms deliveries to Ukraine, Vladimir Putin pointed out. He went on to articulate the principled approaches to the negotiations with Ukraine's representatives by emphasising that Russia remains open to dialogue despite all the inconsistencies in Kiev's position and its unwillingness to take this process seriously. Emmanuel Macron noted the issue of ensuring global food security as an emerging concern. In this context, Vladimir Putin confirmed that the sanctions imposed by the Western countries have been complicating this issue and noted the importance of ensuring the unimpeded operation of the logistics and transport infrastructure. The two presidents agreed to maintain contacts at various levels."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68299,Meeting with Khabarovsk Territory Governor Mikhail Degtyaryov,2022-04-28T13:15:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin held a working meeting with Governor of Khabarovsk Territory Mikhail Degtyaryov. The socioeconomic situation in the territory was discussed.,"The Governor reported that his region's economic indices were back to 2019 levels and had even exceeded these: industrial production stood at 117 percent, construction – 176 percent, investment in fixed assets – 103 percent, and retail trade – 103 percent. Personal revenue had risen by 19 percent on 2019. Unemployment is below its pre-crisis levels at 0.74 percent. Last year, 16 capital construction facilities were commissioned, including six social facilities built under national projects, such as a kindergarten, a sports and recreation centre, lawn tennis courts, and a water supply intake. Some other commissioned facilities were financed by private investors and the federal government, including the Chaika (Seagull) ice palace in Nikolayevsk-on-Amur, and a wrestling arena in Khabarovsk. As for healthcare, Mikhail Degtyaryov reported that a TB dispensary, a department of infectious diseases at a children's hospital, and a children's health centre in Khabarovsk would be commissioned before the end of 2022. Under the primary care modernisation programme, 30 village first-aid stations and 10 outpatient departments will be built before 2025. Frozen construction projects are being revived, including a hospital in Nikolayevsk-on-Amur, a children's hospital complex and an oncologic dispensary in Komsomolsk-on-Amur. The construction works there came to a standstill in 2019. The Governor also reported on support for the retired and families with children as well as on resettling people from dilapidated housing. According to the Governor, his region is planning to double the Gross Regional Product to 1.7 trillion roubles by 2026 under the Programme for the Development of the Russian Far East. This will be achieved on the basis of implementing several major projects, including a mining and processing plant on the Malmyzhsky deposit, the Pacific Railway from Yakutia; the Port of Elga in the Sea of Okhotsk, from which coal will be delivered to customers financed by private investment; a pipeline and an LNG plant from Yakutian gas fields in the north of the Khabarovsk Territory; the Pacific leach plant in Sovetskaya Gavan; a cement plant on the Nilansky limestone deposit; Thermal Power Plant-4 in Khabarovsk being built by RusHydro; the Nimansky hydropower station; the Tugurskaya tidal power station, and hydrogen production. The total investment amounts to 2.8 trillion rubles. The Governor described Russian Railways' Eastern testing range as a key project with a direct bearing on the Khabarovsk Territory. Pursuant to President Putin's instructions, a Far Eastern building materials cluster will be created in Khabarovsk, which will supply building materials to Russian Railways and its contractors. They also discussed the implementation of other Presidential instructions. Those had to do with renovations in Far Eastern cities, a project covering three of the region's cities – Khabarovsk, Komsomolsk-on-Amur and Sovetskaya Gavan. A project will be launched for individual housing construction using the client's material. In addition, half a million square metres of housing will be built in the region under the Far Eastern Neighbourhood project sponsored by the Ministry for the Development of the Far East. The next Presidential instruction concerns holding WorldSkills 2023 in Khabarovsk. Incidentally, an international air terminal capable of serving 1 million passengers per year is being built there, and will open in March 2023; and a new runway has been built, where all types of aircraft will be able to land. As many as 3,000 people will come from all over the country, with competitions in 80 skills announced. The Governor also spoke about the development of higher education in the region, an inter-university campus project to be implemented as a public-private partnership, involving the Ministry of Education and Science and the Government of the Khabarovsk Territory. Mikhail Degtyaryov asked the President to support this project, as well as to support the development of the Russia – My History park in Khabarovsk. Importantly, the new theme park will include displays on the history of the region. Mikhail Degtyaryov also spoke about the plan to manufacture the new aircraft, Baikal, in Komsomolsk-on-Amur. The local aircraft builders have all the necessary competencies. Agreements have been reached that the Ministry for the Development of the Far East will provide funding to build the plants, while the Ministry of Industry and Trade will pay for the equipment. Superjets are manufactured in the same area, the governor said. Vladimir Putin noted that Baikal is an excellent 9–12 seat aircraft, the world's first aeroplane with an emergency parachute system. It will be able to land on water, and on snow, on skis, and use a short runway that is only 300 metres long. However, the immediate goal is to develop a Russian-made engine for it. The President stressed that it would be a good aircraft designed for the regions, including Siberia and the Far East, and for local airlines. The President approved the region's performance results with regard to objective figures and indicators, and suggested looking at the documents prepared by the Governor."

Of course, the emergency medical service specialists demonstrated their best qualities in full during the coronavirus pandemic, which proved to be a serious challenge for the medical community, for the whole country. Your selfless, hard work rightfully deserves our sincere gratitude and acknowledgement. I believe you will continue to work conscientiously and honorably, carrying on the rich traditions of the many generations of your predecessors, introduce new approaches and technology, and improve personnel training methods."""
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68297,Meeting with Council of Lawmakers,2022-04-27T16:45:00Z,St Petersburg,"On the Day of Russian Parliamentarism, the President met with members of the Council of Lawmakers at the Federation Council of the Russian Federation. The meeting was held in the Tauride Palace, per tradition.","Speech at the Council of Lawmakers meeting President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues. I would like to welcome all of you to our traditional meeting. I would like to congratulate you on the Day of Russian Parliamentarism, you and your colleagues, senators and deputies at all levels, legislative body staff and, of course, veteran MPs. In May, the Council of Lawmakers will be 10 years old. We have all seen for ourselves that this format is useful and essential. As it coordinates the drafting of laws, following the principles of federalism, the Council facilitates the balanced development of our country. It reflects the diversity and wealth of our regions, our territories. Your work is based on a constructive public dialogue. Such an open, specific exchange of opinions is certainly raising the Council's responsibility before the people and society for every promise, initiative and proposal. If we make a public statement, it should not just be left hanging with the public waiting while nothing happens. We should never allow this. I would like to emphasise, in this context, that the amendments to the Constitution adopted in 2020 have not only strengthened the position and influence of our parliament– and it is perfectly obvious that we have strengthened our parliamentarism– but they have also created conditions for further developing Russia's independent, sovereign legislation and national jurisdiction without lectures and interference from any outside force. It is the people and the people alone that are the source of power in our country. Its representatives– the parliamentary parties– for all the competition between them, are invariably acting from the same position when it comes to fundamental national interests and the resolution of our Fatherland's defense and security issues. This kind of patriotic attitude is clear and inherent in our people, always supported by the majority, the overwhelming majority of Russians. Every election and all public opinion polls have confirmed this, and this cannot be otherwise anyway because love for the Motherland is one of the key foundations of Russian statehood and the most important value for our society, which invariably manifests itself at critical times for the country. Such unity of the people is a great value and a guarantee that Russia will be able to stand up to the most complex challenges and threats, and will confidently go through any trial. This has always been so, and so it will be now. In this regard, I would like to emphasise again: all the goals of the special military operation launched on February 24 will definitely be attained in order to guarantee peace and security for the residents of the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics, of Russian Crimea, and our entire country in a historical perspective. We must be aware and confident that our soldiers and officers have averted a real danger posed to our Motherland. Their courage, determination, and heroism have prevented a larger conflict that would have unfolded on our territory, but following someone else's scenarios. The forces that have always pursued a policy of containing Russia– historically indeed, they did so in ancient times, and you know very well why they did this– they do not want such a huge and independent country that is too big for their ideas. They believe it endangers them simply by the fact of its existence. Although this is far from reality; it is they who endanger the world. We have not forgotten the barbarous plans of the Nazis for the Soviet people– to drive them out. You remember, don't you? They wanted to force those who could work to work like slaves, do slave labour in bondage. Those who were not wanted were supposed to be sent beyond the Urals or to the North to extinction. All this was recorded in documents, in historical documents. We remember this. We also remember how the Western states encouraged terrorists and criminals in the North Caucasus in the early 1990s and 2000s, how they exploited the problems of our past, real problems, injustices of the past as regards entire peoples, including the peoples of the Caucasus. But they did all this not to make us better, not at all. They did all this to bring the problems of the past to us today, to encourage separatist attitudes in our country and eventually to split and destroy it. This is why they did all this. They wanted to drive us into the backwoods. Many have tried to do the same to Russia throughout all eras. They did not reach their goal but could not accept their failure, that we managed to hold out against this onslaught at the time. This is why they later launched large-scale preparations for an economic war against Russia, using any excuse, and sometimes without any excuse at all, to impose more and more sanctions on us; but today's plans to strangle us economically have also fallen through. In addition, our enemies have been expediting the development of new""geopolitical weapons."" These weapons are basically nothing new, but they obviously gave them new motivation and a new impetus. They placed their bets on Russophobia and neo-Nazis and were impudently, unceremoniously turning our neighbor Ukraine into an""anti-Russia"" year after year. I would like to recall that when Russia had a benevolent, I would say, a friendly, comradely, fraternal attitude to the creation of an independent Ukrainian state, we thought, of course, that it would be a friendly state, that we could go further together, strengthening and developing each other and creating the most competitive conditions for progress– yes, in new and historical conditions. No one could imagine the creation of an""anti-Russia"" on historical Russian territory. We simply cannot allow this to happen, and so it all comes down to a conflict, a direct conflict. Ukraine was pushed into direct confrontation with Russia, our country. Let me remind you that this was, unfortunately, all laid out, including an armed attack on Crimea and Donbass, in Ukraine's doctrinal documents of today, while at the same time, the Ukrainian people were allotted the destiny of""expendable material."" I believe a large part of the Ukrainian people are coming to realise this. The entire course of recent events, including the Kiev regime's claims to possess nuclear weapons, the deployment of a network of Western biolabs on Ukrainian territory, the seamless supplies of cutting-edge weapons to Ukraine, has confirmed that our reaction to those cynical plans was correct and timely. Colleagues, I would like to emphasise once again that our soldiers and officers, and the Donbass militia are heroically doing their duty, and as I said, all their goals and objectives will be met. But I would also like to note something I spoke about at the beginning of the special military operation. Let me emphasise once again: if anyone intends to intervene from the outside and create a strategic threat to Russia that is unacceptable to us, they should know that our retaliatory strikes will be lightning-fast. We have the tools we need for this, the likes of which no one else can claim at this point. We will not just brag; we will use them if necessary. And I want everyone to know this; we have made all the decisions on this matter. Colleagues, I would like to thank all the parties in the State Duma and the Federation Council for their firmness, solidarity and support, for ensuring the high pace and quality of lawmaking in close cooperation with the Government of the Russian Federation. I hope the regional legislators will work just as intensively and will just as quickly coordinate their activities with the regional executive authorities. I am referring to the many packages of anti-sanction measures adopted in the past two months, dozens of important laws and by-laws, which have already passed through the local legislatures and through Russian parliament. I would like to note that specific decisions will be made in the near future on the indexation of pensions and all social benefits, as well as the salaries of specialists employed in the public sector. To ensure practical implementation of this policy, I ask the parliamentarians to carefully work out the necessary amendments and legal mechanisms. These and the other decisions we have been making are aimed at providing direct assistance to the most vulnerable categories of the population– families with children and senior citizens. The key industries, strategic enterprises, small and medium-sized businesses are also receiving and will continue to receive support. As a result, by taking the measures I have just mentioned, we have not just softened, but, as I said, we have repelled, blocked the very first crushing blow– as the West believed it to be– of the illegitimate sanctions against our country. Our banking system, national currency, transport, trade, and the economy in general have withstood the shock and have not crumbled. On the contrary, they now have good resources for development, for the launch of new projects in infrastructure and industry, and for developing and unlocking the potential of all our regions. Undoubtedly, this is the result of a balanced and responsible socioeconomic policy over the recent years, the implementation of our national projects, and the result of your, my colleagues, concerted and energetic efforts amid today's extraordinary circumstances. I want you to partner with the ministries and departments, governors' teams, as I mentioned earlier, and the business, scientific and expert communities in order to continue to develop new, effective and well-thought-out anti-crisis measures, to strengthen parliamentary control from within over the implementation of decisions, and to support our people. It is important to ensure not only stability in the economy, the domestic market, and the regular operation of industrial enterprises, but to strengthen our country's industrial and technological sovereignty and even global leadership in certain areas. This is an absolutely feasible task in areas where we have the required scientific expertise, engineering schools and production base, and we do have that in our country. How many aircraft did we make before? Carrier companies were happy with buying foreign-made equipment which, indeed, boasts advantages in terms of noise levels and fuel consumption, but our manufacturers should strive to achieve these standards. However, they could hardly overcome this challenge in a situation where the domestic market was flooded with foreign manufacturers; that is the problem. And it is so with most products. However, wherever possible, wherever, to reiterate, we have advanced schools, engineers and readily available potential, this potential needs to be developed. We have many such areas. Many areas of production, and high-tech production at that, see good, new and modern opportunities opening up. As I have said, we will counter any crude and often inept external restrictions, the destruction of all civilised rights and agreements and attempts to isolate us with greater freedom of entrepreneurship, openness to honest partnerships, respect and reliable protection of owners and genuine investors. All these goals require the direct involvement of the deputies at the federal and regional levels alike. I would like to ask you personally to work directly with the heads of municipalities and companies, businesses, NGOs and work teams to help them resolve their problems and eventually grant them additional systemic support measures. I would like to add that United Russia bears special responsibility for this as the leading party. But I am addressing all parliamentary parties now– I am asking you to work together. In general, I would like to ask you to have direct contact with the people. It is no longer important now, not significant whose voters they are and whether any of them voted at all. It is important to devote time and attention to all these people, to respond if you are asked for help and protection. Sometimes people are just asking for advice and it is necessary to respond to this, too. And there is one more important task for those who work in committees on international affairs or friendship groups with their foreign counterparts. I understand that it has become impossible and also pointless to work in some associations, for example, PACE. In general, many of these formats were established in the early 1990s not to harmonise relations in Europe but to influence the post-Soviet space. We understand this. But these instruments have become obsolete. Nobody needs them anymore. Let them deal with their own issues; let them campaign for higher wages and resolution to their mounting problems. We will not spend time talking about them here. This applies to human rights and women's rights or, say, women's inequality in the workplace. Europe and the States have many problems like this, so let them deal with their own problems. But at this time, we need to use any accessible format or channel for parliamentary diplomacy in Europe, Asia, Africa and America, as much as we can– those that have remained. Direct contact can never hurt because we have many supporters in all global regions, I assure you, although you know this yourselves. But it is necessary to work with them to justify our position with arguments, to uphold the truth and to bring information to the people who want to know it, true information. Speaking at a Prosecutor General's Office Board meeting the day before yesterday, I mentioned the need to create a detailed and incontrovertible evidence base covering all the heinous crimes and violations of international humanitarian law committed by the neo-Nazis and foreign mercenaries who are arriving in Ukraine in great numbers. The other day, several of them were destroyed, and several others were detained. The Defence Ministry will present them to the public soon. These atrocities will certainly receive an objective legal assessment. However, it is important to raise these issues at the international level, including at the parliamentary level, even now. I mentioned earlier Kiev's attempt, which was prevented, to physically eliminate some of our journalists through terrorist attacks. Here is what I have to say in this regard. Those criminals, terrorists have been neutralised and detained and their actions are being investigated. But it is no secret that such methods– killing their own journalists and politicians right on the street– have been used quite often in Ukraine in recent years. Now, they decided to take this practice to our country. No doubt, we will do our best to protect the people who work at official Russian television and radio channels, the people who work online and promote patriotism, people who make up the vast majority of our country's media space. But we must be aware that such a threat exists. Of course, we cannot assign guards from the FSO, the FSB or the National Guard to everyone, but we will do and must do our best to ensure their safety. Here is what I would like to say, and what I am absolutely sure of. Any attempts to intimidate the people who work in the media space, to intimidate Russian journalists who have a patriotic position, are doomed. On the contrary, I do not doubt for a single second that these attempts will result in even more people joining their ranks to show that we have people who are not afraid of anything and who are ready to and will uphold our country's interests. Colleagues, There are a quite a few pressing items on your agenda. I wish you luck and every success in your future work. I congratulate everyone on our upcoming great, main holiday– the Day of the Great Victory. I am sure that uncompromising will, courage and loyalty to the Fatherland will always inspire you and all of us. Thank you very much for your attention. I wish you all the best. Thank you."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68287,Meeting with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres,2022-04-26T20:10:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin is holding a meeting with Secretary-General of the United Nations Antonio Guterres in the Kremlin.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Secretary-General, I am very happy to see you. As one of the founders of the United Nations and a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Russia has always supported this universal organisation. We believe the UN is not simply universal but it is unique in a way– the international community does not have another organisation like it. We are doing all we can to support the principles on which it rests, and we intend to continue doing this in the future. We find the expression of some of our colleagues about a world based on rules somewhat strange. We believe the main rule is the UN Charter and other documents adopted by this organisation rather than some papers written by their authors as they see fit or aimed at ensuring their own interests. We are also surprised to hear statements by our colleagues that imply that some in the world have exceptional status or can claim exclusive rights because the Charter of the United Nations reads that all participants in international communication are equal regardless of their strength, size or geographical location. I think this is similar to what the Bible reads about all people being equal. I am sure we will find the same idea in both the Quran and the Torah. All people are equal before God. So, the idea that someone can claim a kind of exceptional status is very strange to us. We are living in a complicated world, and, therefore, we proceed from reality and are willing to work with everyone. No doubt, at one time the United Nations was established to resolve acute crises and went through different periods in its development. Quite recently, just several years ago, we heard it had become obsolete, and there was no need for it anymore. This happened whenever it prevented someone from reaching their goals in the international arena. We have always said that there is no other universal organisation like the United Nations, and it is necessary to cherish the institutions that were created after WWII for the express purpose of settling disputes. I know about your concern over Russia's military operation in Donbass, in Ukraine. I think this will be the focus of our conversation today. I would just like to note in this context that the entire problem emerged after a coup d'état staged in Ukraine in 2014. This is an obvious fact. You can call it whatever name you like and have whatever bias in favour of those who did it, but this was really an anti-constitutional coup. This was followed by the situation with the expression of their will by the residents of Crimea and Sevastopol. They acted in practically the same way as the people living in Kosovo– they made a decision on independence and then turned to us with a request to join the Russian Federation. The only difference between the two cases was that in Kosovo this decision on sovereignty was adopted by Parliament whereas Crimea and Sevastopol made it at a nationwide referendum. A similar problem emerged in south-eastern Ukraine, where the residents of several territories, at least, two Ukrainian regions, did not accept the coup d'état and its results. But they were subjected to very strong pressure, in part, with the use of combat aviation and heavy military equipment. This is how the crisis in Donbass, in south-eastern Ukraine, emerged. As you know, after another failed attempt by the Kiev authorities to resolve this problem by force, we arrived at the signing of agreements in the city of Minsk. This is what they were called– the Minsk Agreements. It was an attempt to settle the situation in Donbass peacefully. To our regret, during the past eight years the people that lived there found themselves under a siege. The Kiev authorities announced in public that they were organising a siege of these territories. They were not embarrassed to call it a siege although initially they had renounced this idea and continued military pressure. Under the circumstances, after the authorities in Kiev actually went on record as saying– I would like to emphasise that the top state officials announced this in public– that they did not intend to fulfil the Minsk Agreements, we were compelled to recognise these regions as independent and sovereign states to prevent the genocide of the people living there. I would like to reiterate: this was a forced measure to stop the suffering of the people living in those territories. Unfortunately, our colleagues in the West preferred to ignore all this. After we recognised the independence of these states, they asked us to render them military aid because they were subjected to military actions, an armed aggression. In accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, Chapter VII, we were forced to do this by launching a special military operation. I would like to inform you that although the military operation is underway, we are still hoping to reach an agreement on the diplomatic track. We are conducting talks. We have not abandoned them. Moreover, at the talks in Istanbul, and I know that you have just been there since I spoke with President Erdogan today, we managed to make an impressive breakthrough. Our Ukrainian colleagues did not link the requirements for Ukraine's international security with such a notion as Ukraine's internationally recognised borders, leaving aside Crimea, Sevastopol and the newly Russia-recognised Donbass republics, albeit with certain reservations. But, unfortunately, after reaching these agreements and after we had, in my opinion, clearly demonstrated our intentions to create the conditions for continuing the talks, we faced a provocation in the town of Bucha, which the Russian Army had nothing to do with. We know who was responsible, who prepared this provocation, using what means, and we know who the people involved were. After this, the position of our negotiators from Ukraine on a further settlement underwent a drastic change. They simply renounced their previous intentions to leave aside issues of security guarantees for the territories of Crimea, Sevastopol and the Donbass republics. They simply renounced this. In the relevant draft agreement presented to us, they simply stated in two articles that these issues must be resolved at a meeting of the heads of state. It is clear to us that if we take these issues to the heads of state level without even resolving them in a preliminary draft agreement, they will never be resolved. In this case, we simply cannot sign a document on security guarantees without settling the territorial issues of Crimea, Sevastopol and the Donbass republics. Nevertheless, the talks are going on. They are now being conducted online. I am still hoping that this will lead us to some positive result. This is all I wanted to say in the beginning. I am sure we will have many questions linked with this situation. Maybe there will be other questions as well. We will talk. I am very happy to see you. Welcome to Moscow.(In his remarks, the UN Secretary General expressed concern over the situation in Ukraine, while emphasising the need for a multilateral world order based on the UN Charter and international law. Antonio Guterres also presented the two proposals he had put forward the same day during his meeting with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. These proposals concern humanitarian matters, including humanitarian corridors, in particular, for Mariupol residents, as well as setting up a humanitarian contact group in which the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs(UN OCHA), the International Committee of the Red Cross(ICRC), Russia, and Ukraine would work together to discuss the situation in order to make these corridors truly safe and effective.) Vladimir Putin: Mr Secretary General, Regarding the invasion, I am well-versed in the documents of the International Court on the situation in Kosovo. In fact, I have read them myself. I remember very well the decision by the International Court, which states that when fulfilling its right to self-determination a territory within any state does not have to seek permission from the country's central government in order to proclaim its sovereignty. This was the ruling on Kosovo, and this is what the International Court decided, and everyone supported it. I personally read all the comments issued by the judicial, administrative and political bodies in the United States and Europe– everyone supported this decision. If so, the Donbass republics, the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic, can enjoy the same right without seeking permission from Ukraine's central government and declare their sovereignty, since the precedent has been created. Is this so? Do you agree with this?(Antonio Guterres noted that the United Nations did not recognise Kosovo). Vladimir Putin: Yes, of course, but the court did. Let me finish what I was saying. If there is a precedent, the Donbass republics can do the same. This is what they did, while we, in turn, had the right to recognise them as independent states. Many countries around the world did this, including our Western opponents, with Kosovo. Many states recognised Kosovo. It is a fact that many Western countries recognised Kosovo as an independent state. We did the same with the Donbass republics. After that, they asked us to provide them with military assistance to deal with the state that launched military operations against them. We had the right to do so in full compliance with Chapter VII, Article 51 of the UN Charter. Just a second, we will talk about this in a minute. But first I would like to address the second part of your question, Mariupol. The situation is difficult and possibly even tragic there. But in fact, it is very simple. I had a conversation with President Erdogan today. He spoke about the ongoing fighting there. No, there is no fighting there; it is over. There is no fighting in Mariupol; it has stopped. Part of the Ukrainian armed forces that were deployed in other industrial districts have surrendered. Nearly 1,300 of them have surrendered, but the actual figure is larger. Some of them were injured or wounded; they are being kept in absolutely normal conditions. The wounded have received medical assistance from our doctors, skilled and comprehensive assistance. The Azovstal plant has been fully isolated. I have issued instructions, an order to stop the assault. There is no direct fighting there now. Yes, the Ukrainian authorities say that there are civilians at the plant. In this case, the Ukrainian military must release them, or otherwise they will be doing what terrorists in many countries have done, what ISIS did in Syria when they used civilians as human shields. The simplest thing they can do is release these people; it is as simple as that. You say that Russia's humanitarian corridors are ineffective. Mr Secretary-General, you have been misled: these corridors are effective. Over 100,000 people, 130,000–140,000, if I remember correctly, have left Mariupol with our assistance, and they are free to go where they want, to Russia or Ukraine. They can go anywhere they want; we are not detaining them, but we are providing assistance and support to them. The civilians in Azovstal, if there are any, can do this as well. They can come out, just like that. This is an example of a civilised attitude to people, an obvious example. And anyone can see this; you only need to talk with the people who have left the city. The simplest thing for military personnel or members of the nationalist battalions is to release the civilians. It is a crime to keep civilians, if there are any there, as human shields. We maintain contact with them, with those who are hiding underground at the Azovstal plant. They have an example they can follow: their comrades-in-arms have surrendered, over a thousand of them, 1,300. Nothing bad has happened to them. Moreover, Mr Secretary-General, if you wish, if representatives of the Red Cross and the UN want to inspect their detainment conditions and see for themselves where and how medical assistance is being provided to them, we are ready to organise this. It is the simplest solution to a seemingly complex issue. Let us discuss this. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68285,Meeting of the Council for the Development of Physical Culture and Sport,2022-04-26T17:50:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",The President held a videoconference meeting of the Presidential Council for the Development of Physical Culture and Sport on further promoting mass sport.,"The meeting participants discussed proposals on further developing mass sport and ensuring wider access to it as well as measures to support domestic sporting goods manufacturers. * * * Excerpts from transcript of meeting of the Council for the Development of Physical Culture and Sport. President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues. I have just met with our athletes – members of the Olympic and Paralympic teams of Russia – and would like to note a few points before getting down to today's agenda. The first point. The winners and medallists of the Beijing 2022 Olympic Games are certainly outstanding athletes who won a befitting number of medals. However, today we are not at a gala event but basically at a production meeting, and we need to objectively evaluate everything that we are doing. In this respect, I would like to note that our final team rating is still below what was planned in the Strategy for the Development of Sport, and I would certainly like the Minister of Sport to report on this. The second point. In the current conditions, in the face of pressure on Russia and its citizens, it is pivotal to maintain our athletes' competitiveness. In addressing our national teams, I said that we intend to carry out everything we planned in sports. As for the projects cancelled in Russia by international sports management associations – well, let God sort them out, we must replace these cancelled competitions with our own new formats. We can do this pretty quickly: organise open multi-stage sports tournaments that will be attractive in all respects, and ensure the participation of foreign athletes, clubs and teams in these tournaments. I would like to ask the Government to immediately start compiling a list of competitions and determine the amounts and sources of funding for both the planned projects and for new initiatives. Now back to the Council's agenda. We continue to review matters related to mass sport. Last time, we discussed children's and youth sports. Today we will discuss ways to involve greater numbers of economically active people in regular physical fitness and sport. Clearly, special approaches are needed since we are talking about people with families whose daily routines include their jobs and household duties. In particular, we need to think about promoting modern corporate fitness. Much has already been accomplished in this area. We should build on the experience of our major companies and state corporations such as Gazprom, Russian Railways, Rosatom, LUKOIL and Rostec, which initiated the revival of the Trudovye Reservy sports society in 2018. I welcome the creation of the Association for Promoting Corporate Fitness. I believe the next step should include a joint programme of action for businesses and government authorities at all levels, as well as public associations, including our renowned sports societies like Dynamo, Spartak and CSKA. I hope that close cooperation and work for a greater common cause will help overcome a number of daunting challenges, for example, in expanding the system for organising and holding mass fitness and sports events. Clearly, the competitions – national, regional and municipal – should be mostly integrated and include multiple stages, be focused on people of all ages and be accessible and appealing to people of all fitness levels. The public must be properly motivated. To do so, it is imperative to expand the coverage and promotion of mass sport in the state media, to enthusiastically promote the National GTO sports programme through outreach awareness drives and various kinds of incentives for participants, and, of course, to create proper conditions for physical activities in the form of modern and well-equipped sports infrastructure. A Paralympic athlete just spoke about this and put it absolutely correctly. It is important to create a conveniently located infrastructure that is easy on the wallet. This is a multifaceted and big issue that needs to be reviewed by the Council separately. I propose holding our next meeting on this. We also expect heads of Russian regions and municipalities to be proactive in developing fitness and sports and ensuring its accessibility. It is especially important to create and launch information systems to help people navigate sports, health and fitness services, find out where and which sport they can do on their own or with their families, and what sports events are planned in their regions. I know that such systems are already in operation in a number of regions. I would also like to remind you of the instruction to create such a resource at the federal level. I would ask you to report on the progress today. In conclusion, I would like to highlight one more point, which is no less important. It was previously decided that by 2024, the constituent entities of the Federation are to allocate at least 2 percent of their regional budgets for sports. I suggest thinking about increasing spending on sports every year from 2025 on and doing it in such a way as to avoid gaps in the financing of sports, the quality and availability of sports infrastructure, depending on each region's financial standing – we know that they are different. Again, this is of the essence, among other things, to achieve the goal of getting 55 percent of Russians involved in regular exercise by 2024, and 70 percent by 2030, and this can only be done if all regions of our country join the effort. I'd like to note that in 2021, 49.4 percent of citizens were reported to regularly do sports. This is a good result, but still far from ideal. Further trends directly depend on the effective implementation of the decisions we make, on how well and timely the instructions are fulfilled, including the instructions issued following the Council for Sport meetings. I ask you to prepare a report on the implementation of these instructions. Let's get to work. <…> Mr Chernyshenko, go ahead please. Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko: Mr President, First, I will describe what the Government has done under the sanctions pressure on your instructions. There are over 250 priority measures to support our economy. They include universal, general measures that, of course, concern sports organisations to varying degrees, and also special measures to assist the sports industry. While drafting them we considered the proposals of the entire professional community. I will briefly list the main ones, which the Prime Minister has approved. It is important to talk about them on your platform to let as many participants in the industry as possible hear about them and use them. We have 185,000 physical culture and sports organisations. They now have access to benefits like preferential loans, schedule extensions for implementing projects through subsidies and their special budgets by two years, a moratorium on the bankruptcy of legal entities, the suspension of inspections, the easing of administrative tax liabilities including a moratorium on tax sanctions, a possibility to include expenses for maintenance of social infrastructure facilities in their costs, and – something very important – the involvement of sports-related small and medium-sized businesses and socially-oriented NGOs in state contracts. Since March 1, over half of all state contracts have been concluded with small and medium-sized sports companies worth about 22.5 billion rubles. The second point. We have drafted measures to support domestic sports equipment manufacturers under the import substitution programme. The Ministry of Sport and the Ministry of Industry and Trade are jointly working on purchases of domestic equipment for health and fitness centres and arenas. They are buying this equipment directly from manufacturers through a specially created service – a kind of import substitution stock exchange. It unites over 14,000 different companies and we are encouraging sports equipment manufacturers to find consumers through this exchange. Now every seventh company has joined this service while manufacturers have received the opportunity to postpone tax payments with no penalties. The validity period for certificates confirming the origin of domestic equipment has been extended and so-called reverse engineering introduced. Third, the government has redistributed the funds that became available after the international competitions had been cancelled, through no fault of ours, to promoting sports. As part of the new federal project, ""Business Sprint,"" over 2 billion rubles will be used to build an additional 80 sports grounds for mass sport within walking distance of users. By the way, this initiative was supported by United Russia. Initially, we planned to open 110 of such ""smart grounds"" this year. In all, 370 such sites, worth over 12 billion rubles, will be built in all our regions within the next three years. The grounds that will be built this year will make it possible for many of our people, primarily children, to feel the effect and start exercising right next to their blocks of flats. Fourth, it was decided to adjust the federal budget funds that are being allocated to the regions for purchasing sports equipment for inflation. One billion rubles in additional funding has already been set aside. As per your instruction, we are making sure that the installation of sports infrastructure continues uninterrupted. Co-financing of the construction of 167 sports facilities worth over 33 billion rubles in all regions continues. About 100 of them will become operational this year. We hope to be on schedule with all of them. There are major facilities like ice arenas with 10,500–12,000 seats that are being built on your instruction in Novosibirsk and Omsk, or a sports and recreation complex in Ufa for 500 seats. The costs involved in the construction will be adjusted as well. To compensate for higher prices on building materials, budget allocations for sports infrastructure have been increased by over 1.2 billion rubles. Fifth and last, we have altered our approach to competitions. We plan to hold integrated sports competitions with our partners from the SCO and BRICS. The sports ministers in the SCO countries will determine a joint plan for promoting sports in our respective countries in Tashkent in May. Mr President, We will soon submit documents for holding cross-years of sports in Russia and China for your consideration. The corresponding plan has been worked through. China is also very active in this regard, and it will help us maintain competitive activities in the country since athletes need to train and compete with other top-level athletes. So, this year's calendar includes over 4,500 events in 134 sports, both Olympic and non-Olympic, such as championships, cups, Russian national championships and other national competitions that we will hold as open events. We believe it is important to make international-level award payments to athletes participating in these competitions, including athletes from friendly countries. Please support this proposal. And sixth. We are working on replacing the foreign bases where our athletes in some sports used to train. The Government has allocated over 800 million rubles within the priority measures to upgrade the existing federal training centres including adapting them for Paralympic practice. Most of the training sessions this year will be held at centres in the Moscow and Tula regions, the Krasnodar and Stavropol territories, and in Crimea. Russia must set up new bases in different climatic and nature zones. This is what you were talking about at the meeting with the Olympians, and one of the Paralympians said this. The Ministry of Sport has been instructed on the matter. To conclude, I will emphasise that we can now clearly see how the present situation has virtually united everyone who sincerely cares about our country, and about Russian sport, and we actually have many friends. We must get through this situation with the most possible benefits for Russian sport, with our own modern training centres, with Russian technology and our methods of training. You asked to report separately on how your instructions are being fulfilled as regards the introduction of the Fitness and Sport information system. The design, on the Gostech platform, was completed in 2021. Preliminary tests have been run and performance verified. It included 14 regions and nine sports federations. This state information system is a very convenient tool for managing the entire sports industry across the country both in public and professional sports. It offers services for athletes and for everyone in sports, which means 67 million people in our country. The services have been worked out to meet users' needs and expectations. This digital platform is being made available to all sports facilities for free. It has a number of planning tools, for example, a marketplace where commercial information services for sports activities (they have a lot of traffic) can meet the consumer, or competition schedules that include not only international and Russian national competitions but also public events including in villages, as well as a register of over 300,000 facilities across the country. Every citizen will be able to select a sports school for their child or make an appointment for a test session via their personal account. You will be shown an example of a regional system today. Thank you very much. This concludes my report. <…> Minister of Sport Oleg Matytsin: Mr President, Allow me to report on the results of the Olympic Games, which you mentioned in your opening remarks. Objectively, Russia won 32 medals. We excelled in the number of silver and bronze medals and that of fourth places. On the one hand, this is good news, as is the fact that 68 Russian athletes have won a range of medals. This is also the best achievement. For example, Canada had 59 athletes, Germany – 57 athletes, and Norway – 34 athletes. It is also important that we ascended the podium in ten events. This is also the best result. But, of course, you were absolutely right in saying that we failed to gain eight gold medals as we had announced, winning instead only six. What are the reasons? First, in our opinion, the management and training of national teams is insufficiently centralised, including the scientific, methodological, logistical and medical support. We think it is necessary to expand the powers of the Ministry of Sport and amend the regulations accordingly. We have drafted the relevant proposals. Mr Chernyshenko has commented on the second objective point, which is also important. The Russian Federation lacks a number of sports training facilities, specifically year-round skiing, biathlon, skating, Alpine skiing, snowboard and freestyle bases. This has become particularly obvious during the COVID-19 pandemic and the period of sanctions. In keeping with the Government's instructions, we have prepared relevant proposals with a feasibility study. We hope that you will support this project. There were, of course, subjective factors, such as the denial of access to unvaccinated Russian athletes or deliberate refusal to issue visas. An objective reason, as I see it, is also the fact that many leading Russian athletes – Pavel Kulizhnikov, Roman Repilov, Mikhail Kolyada, Maxim Gurov, and Eduard Latypov – were exposed to Covid. This happened shortly before the Olympic Games and they did not recover in time for the Games. Naturally, we have conducted an expert analysis jointly with the Russian Olympic Committee and the federations. We have taken into account all the problems I have mentioned and a plan of preparations for the next Olympic cycle has been drawn up. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68284,Meeting with winners and medallists of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and members of the Russian Paralympic team,2022-04-26T15:50:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin met with the winners and medallists of the XXIV Winter Olympic Games in Beijing and members of the Russian Paralympic team in the Grand Kremlin Palace's St George Hall.,"Before the meeting, Vladimir Putin presented state decorations to the gold medallists of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.*** President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, good afternoon, I am delighted to see you all in this Kremlin hall. I would like to begin by thanking you all– thank you for your hard work, for your achievements and your strong determination to win. Your victories in sports are certainly an inspiring, maybe even a super-inspiring example for many, for millions of people. It is highly significant for our entire society, for our youth, who are learning to be as resilient and dedicated as you are, as determined to persevere towards their goal and achieve the highest success, the highest results, to be the best. This is something that your mentors and coaches have largely taught to you to be; they were always there for you, supporting you, raising you along with your parents, and they are certainly proud of you now, probably even more proud than you are. Making it through the most difficult qualifications for the Olympic and Paralympic Games is already impressive. The path towards this is always thorny and demands special talent and selfless work; each of you has negotiated that path worthily. But of course, winning gold, the gold medal of the world's biggest tournament, is the highest point in any athlete's career. Once again, I congratulate the champions of Beijing– our brilliant figure skaters and excellent skiers. At the same time, I would like to note all the other medallists. The second and third places on the Olympic podium are a huge victory as well, especially when it comes to long-awaited medals– such as the silver medal in ski jumping, something Russians have not won since 1968, or bronze in women's single sled(the last medal was won in 1980), or in the women's mogul, where they managed to repeat the achievement of 1994. Alexandra Trusova's silver medal stands tall as well. She was the first in the world to successfully land five quadruple jumps and opened a new page in the history of figure skating. The men's speed skating team set another Olympic record, just one step away from the champion title. Overall, Russian skaters, including the short track, brought the national team two silver and two bronze medals. Russian biathletes won four Olympic medals. We know that we can do more. The same applies to the men's ice hockey team with the arrival of a new and promising generation. There is a lot of potential in freestyle, which can be seen in the fact that our team, including both recognised masters of this sport and their worthy younger cohort, won three bronze medals. It is my hope that snowboarder Victor Wild, who won a bronze medal in Beijing, will contribute to training future champions. I know that Victor announced his retirement from the sport, but his knowledge and experience are very important for the next generation. I would like to especially emphasise our Paralympic athletes. You trained hard to show your best at the Beijing Paralympics, and to prove in an honest and open competition that you are the best and deserve this status. Of course, the way things played out does not stand up to any criticism. The fact that athletes from Russia and Belarus were prevented from competing was not only an outright violation of the fundamental principles of sport, but an act of open and, dare I say, cynical trampling of fundamental human rights. All this is set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly back in 1948. This is not a question of the political, legal, or international status of the country the athletes represent. It is about the people, the athletes themselves. Their rights have been trampled upon. Our athletes suffered from discrimination on purely political grounds, based on their citizenship and ethnic background. This is something unimaginable, since it is completely at odds with the principles of the Olympic and Paralympic movements. In fact, the""recommendations"" took on the form of actual sanctions. Unfortunately, all this demonstrates the continuing drive towards subjecting sports to a business agenda, considering the growing dependence on sponsors– the money bags. This applies to both the Paralympic and the Olympic movements. Unfortunately, it goes without saying that dependence on corporations and subjecting Paralympic and Olympic sports to a business agenda is the path towards degradation. Time and again, Russia has warned its partners against using double standards and the principle of collective responsibility in sports. Guided by the Olympic Charter, we kept telling them that the Games are a competition of athletes, not countries, and called for making sports politics-free, since politics reduces the values that international sports stand for to nothing, and it turns sports into a tool of manipulation. Unfortunately, we have been witnessing cases which carry these actions and policies by our partners to the point of absurdity. What happened to our swimmer Yevgeny Rylov recently is a case in point. The International Swimming Federation suspended him for nine months from competition just because be attended a concert on the anniversary of Crimea's reunification with Russia. This is total nonsense. Such situations and approaches have been and remain a serious, major problem for both athletes and sports organisations, and for people who realise the huge importance of sports as a unique system for developing individuals and society and promoting ties and friendship between countries and peoples. All this is also obvious to Russia, to its citizens, and therefore we will fulfil all sports-related programmes, plans and commitments. We remain open to broad constructive cooperation with anyone who values the principles of sports and is loyal to sports. This is borne out, for instance, in the Winter Games that Russia organised in Khanty-Mansiysk for the strongest Paralympians. Russian and Belarusian athletes are some of the best in the world. This is a fact beyond doubt. They won a third of all awards at the world championships held before the Games in Beijing. Armenia, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan also have strong teams that took part in our sports holiday. Russia has the absolute long-standing lead in ski races and biathlon. Ivan Golubkov, Yekaterina Rumyantseva, Stanislav Chokhlayev and Anastasia Bagiyan confirmed this in Khanty- Mansiysk. The alpine skiers achieved their traditionally high results as well. I would like to congratulate Alexei Bugayev, Varvara Voronchikhina and Valery Redkozubov on their victories. Our snowboarders Mikhail Slinkin and Alexei Petrov also won gold medals as did representatives of the Russian sledge hockey school, who invariably demonstrate a real team spirit and brilliant skills. Winners and medallists of the Khanty-Mansiysk Games will receive bonuses corresponding to the traditional payment awards for achievements at the Paralympics. Without exaggeration, the contribution of our athletes to the development and promotion of the Olympic and Paralympic Games is enormous. Today, I would like to congratulate you and the veterans of Soviet and Russian sports that are still with us; thank you for your outstanding successes and I wish you all the best. The glorious traditions of Russian sport will be maintained and strengthened. We will do all we can to protect the rights of our athletes, and the competitions we hold will be open to all our friends and real partners, such as the World Olympians Association and the International Military Sports Council, which has supported Russian athletes. There are no unfriendly countries for Russia in sports. We are happy to welcome anyone who stands for sports without discrimination or artificial barriers and for the sports ideals of justice, equality and fair competition. I would like to wholeheartedly congratulate all of you once again and to wish you new victories. Thank you. <…> Vladimir Putin: In conclusion, I would like to add a few words to what our Paralympian has said. I believe that his main idea was that problems are being created for us and that we always become stronger when we overcome these problems. We have everything we need for this. We have perfectly obvious competitive advantages connected with the size of our country, its scale, its various climate zones, its technological development and the growing government attention to sports, athletes and physical fitness. I would like to point out again that your example is inspiring millions of people and encouraging government agencies and officials at all levels to respond appropriately to the requirements that appear in connection with your achievements and to join forces to explore new horizons, including in sports. I would like to congratulate you once again on your achievements at the Olympic Games and to wish every success to our Paralympians. We will do everything I have mentioned here, which is what we will be talking about right now at the Presidential Council for the Development of Physical Culture and Sport. Thank you once again for your achievements, and all the best.(The National Anthem of Russia plays.)"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68281,Presenting state decorations to winners of XXIV Winter Olympic Games in Beijing,2022-04-26T14:30:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",The ceremony for presenting state decorations to the gold medallists of the XXIV Winter Olympic Games in Beijing took place in the Kremlin's St Catherine Hall.,"Vladimir Putin presented state decorations to Kamila Valiyeva, Alexander Gallyamov, Nikita Katsalapov, Mark Kondratyuk, Anastasia Mishina, Viktoria Sinitsina, Denis Spitsov, Veronika Stepanova and Alexei Chervotkin. Earlier today, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko and Presidential Aide Igor Levitin presented state decorations to the silver and bronze medallists of the Beijing Olympics. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends, I am delighted to see you, to be able to congratulate you on your brilliant performance at the XXIV Winter Olympic Games in Beijing and to present state decorations to you. You have won them with your talent, hard work, skill and dedication to sports and its values and ideals. It is not an overstatement to say that your brilliant resolute wins and the victories of all our Olympians, the Russian athletes, have become the real gems of the Winter Olympics. Fans not only in Russia but throughout the world admired and rejoiced at your performances. You have proved once again that you are among the best athletes in the world. Russia has held absolute leadership in women's single figure skating for the third Olympics. The strikingly beautiful virtuoso skating by our young ladies, with Anna Shcherbakova at the top, has been an unreachable summit for their rivals. This is really so. We have heard the words your rivals used, and they are true. Russia has won yet another gold in the team figure skating event. Technically difficult and very impressive performances of Alexander Gallyamov and Anastasia Mishina, Viktoria Sinitsina and Nikita Katsalapov, Mark Kondratyuk and Kamila Valiyeva struck a chord with the fans and judges. Thankfully, the judging was stable and impartial in this context. Of course, the whole of Russia and figure skating fans all over the world were particularly rooting for Kamila. Her talent has soaked up all the most difficult elements of figure skating, its flexibility, beauty, power and tenderness. Through her hard work, she has elevated the sport to true art. It is impossible to reach this level of perfection by dishonest means, with the help of additional methods or manipulations. Moreover, there is no need for all these additional means or methods in figure skating – all of us understand and know this full well. For the time being, let us wish Kamila many happy returns of the day: she is celebrating her birthday today. I will have an opportunity to do this again in an informal setting. Russian skiers have also achieved outstanding successes. Here I will primarily note the long-awaited skiing relay victories. As is common knowledge, the last time a [Russian] women's cross-country skiing team won the title of champion was in 2006, and a men's team – in 1980. And we have not seen a simultaneous victory by the relay teams, male and female, for precisely 50 years. This is certainly a great achievement. The confident and powerful performance by our ladies – Yulia Stupak, Tatyana Sorina, Natalya Nepryayeva and Veronika Stepanova – has become a big present to our fans. More than that, Veronika Stepanova turned out to be the youngest cross-country skiing champion in Olympic history. The men – Sergei Ustyugov, Alexei Chervotkin, Denis Spitsov and Alexander Bolshunov – have shown their worth in a no less brilliant manner. Their performance was daring – daring in the best sense of the word. Let me note that Alexander Bolshunov gathered a large collection of Olympic awards in Beijing: three gold medals, a silver medal, a bronze medal, and the absolutely deserved symbolic title of ""the king of skis."" Everyone knows this well, and I have an opportunity to congratulate him. I congratulate once again all of you who are present here on your convincing victories, and, of course, I wish you new successes. You will certainly achieve them. Congratulations. Thank you. <…> Vladimir Putin: Friends, Let me once again congratulate you on your state decorations. One of the recipients has just said that the necessary conditions were created for you, but it is our duty, the duty of any state and officials in charge of organising work in the field of sports to do this. Of course, the credit goes to your hard work. Hard work, talent and commitment of you and your coaches – you are the real heroes here. Your success is essential for the country and, in fact, for every Russian, I believe. You know this, but I would like to stress it once again. Thank you very much. I wish you success and congratulate you."

When asked about the situation in Mariupol, the President of Russia noted that the city had been liberated and there were no hostilities there. As for the Ukrainian service members and militants from the nationalist battalions blocked on the grounds of the Azovstal plant, the Kiev authorities should take political responsibility and, out of humane considerations, order them to lay down their arms. Prisoners of war have our guarantee that their lives will be spared, they will receive medical help and be treated in accordance with international legal rules. Vladimir Putin also informed his counterpart about the progress of talks between the Russian and Ukrainian representatives. The two leaders agreed to continue coordination between their respective defence agencies to ensure Turkish ships safe departure from the Black Sea ports along the maritime humanitarian corridor arranged by the Russian side. The parties also touched upon the bilateral agenda, including air transport and tourism and expressed particular satisfaction with the growth of trade and economic cooperation. It was agreed to maintain ongoing dialogue."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68277,Meeting on economic issues,2022-04-25T17:10:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",The President held a regular meeting on economic issues via videoconference,"The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Anton Vaino, First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov, Presidential Aide Maxim Oreshkin, Minister of Economic Development Maxim Reshetnikov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina. * * * Opening remarks at the meeting on economic issues President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues, We have agreed to hold regular meetings on the situation in the Russian economy and monitor changes in key macroeconomic indicators that characterise business, investment activity and labour market dynamics. Naturally, this work is of special importance because based on the detailed analysis and consideration of potential risks, we have taken and will take measures on additional support for our people, industries and companies, as well as the economy as a whole. I would like to emphasise that the economy continues to stabilise. Inflation has slowed; weekly price increases have approached normal levels, and prices on some goods have started dropping. Analysts believe that two major factors are playing a role in this: the currency market situation, where the ruble has been rapidly growing stronger again, and the second factor, the consumer demand dynamic. I would like to emphasise that after a surge in February and March, consumer activity has objectively declined. It is very important not to lose control of the situation and to prevent a misbalance in economic dynamics. On the one hand, we need to ensure gradual normalisation of pricing dynamics, and on the other, it is essential to prevent a serious reduction in demand, which could lead to setbacks in the operation of companies and a decrease in budget revenues. So, in the current situation, it is necessary to support domestic companies to enable them to increase the supply of goods and services. It is also important to encourage domestic demand and the purchasing power of the population. In this respect, I would like to draw your attention to key, important factors like the employment rate and average income. As I have said more than once, we will judge the efficiency of our economic policy with these indicators. I should note that the lower lending activity of the banking system is affecting the final demand. Commercial risk and growing interest rates are the reason. Everybody understands that. We know this. Let me remind you that the key rate increase by the Central Bank was, however, justified and necessary to stabilise the banking sector and financial markets. The decision proved successful and the Bank of Russia is already lowering the key rate gradually, which will make loans cheaper. Other steps are possible based on the real situation in the sector, but this is the prerogative of the Central Bank. It is important that the Government is also issuing directives to complement these measures. Special programmes to support key industries have been launched. Easy-term loans are available to backbone enterprises in industrial production, trade, agriculture, oil processing and construction. Companies in these industries are also eligible for guarantees from VEB.RF worth a total of 800 billion rubles. I would like to add that, despite the current challenges, we are keeping the easy-term mortgage programmes, including mortgages for families, with more funds allocated from the federal budget. At the same time, I believe it is necessary to issue additional directives – primarily, with respect to mortgages. As we can see, the dynamic here is slower than the forecasts, and to make buying homes more accessible to people and stimulate real estate development in general, I propose lowering the easy-term mortgage rate from the recently set 12 percent to 9 percent per annum. Yes, we did recently set this interest rate at 12 percent but the overall situation is positive, which makes it possible to lower it. It is also necessary to extend the easy-term mortgage programme until the end of this year. Next subject. Many companies are still experiencing a serious shortage of working capital that is used to purchase raw materials, components and services. This shortage must be compensated for. Our business colleagues always mention this at our industry-specific meetings. Therefore, I believe it is possible to introduce two new measures. I propose expanding the guaranteed support programme by VEB beyond the backbone companies to provide support to other enterprises that do not have this status yet but that are already larger than small and medium-sized businesses and operate in the real sector. I should remind you as well that we already have some special support measures in place for smaller businesses. The VEB guarantees will account for up to 50 percent of a loan. I believe that the total value of the loans supported by this programme must be around 1.1 trillion rubles. The second thing. I suggest granting a delay in insurance premium payments for companies that supply the domestic market with goods and services. We have talked at length about various support instruments such as a high Central Bank rate, as I mentioned. We have also talked about different support mechanisms for companies and sectors, but this is a systemic measure that covers almost all of the economy. I suggest suspending these payments for one year. I would like to clarify right now that this measure would apply to all the companies I just mentioned. This list will not include exporters, financial and wholesale trade companies or public sector organisations. The Government will determine a precise list of the sectors included. A grace period, for suspending these insurance payments, will cover the second quarter of this year. This grace period will also run through the third quarter for manufacturing companies. We estimate that this measure will apply to over 2.8 million companies with almost 52 million workers. It will allow businesses to keep about 1.1 trillion rubles in the second quarter and another half a trillion rubles in the third quarter. These funds will work inside the economy, ensuring the production cycle. They will provide additional support for related companies, suppliers and contractors. Let me repeat: insurance payments for the second and third quarters will have to be made starting in May 2023. Moreover, we can also think about additional preferences for manufacturing companies as regards payments in the third quarter. I will not go into detail right now, but it will be possible to do this if the employment and payroll funds are kept at June 1, 2022 levels. I would like to ask the Government to draft detailed proposals on the criteria for these benefits based on the economic situation in general. I have special instructions for the Finance Ministry – to anticipate compensating for the shortfall in revenue in extra-budgetary funds. This must have enough money to ensure the confident operation of the healthcare and social support systems. And, of course, I am instructing the Government, in cooperation with the Bank of Russia, to closely follow all developments and analyse the efficiency of the suggested mechanisms with a view to making adjustments whenever necessary. Let's get down to discussing today's agenda. Ms Nabiullina, go ahead please."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68274,Expanded meeting of the Prosecutor General's Office Board,2022-04-25T14:00:00Z,Moscow,Vladimir Putin took part in an expanded meeting of the Prosecutor General's Office Board. The President reviewed the office's performance in 2021 and outlined short-term and long-term priorities.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prosecutor General, colleagues, Earlier this year, we celebrated 300 years of the Russian Prosecution Service, once again emphasising its significant role in the history of the Fatherland, the development of our society and the building of the foundations of a rule-of-law state. During the annual expanded meeting of the Prosecutor General's Office Board today, we will sum up the results of your work in 2021, considering the current situation, and will discuss objectives for the short and long term. I should note that over this latest period, the prosecution bodies have maintained positive momentum with respect to a whole range of key performance indicators. Prompt intervention by prosecutors helped to protect the social rights of over 1 million citizens, including paying almost 20.5 billion rubles in wage arrears. Prosecutors of different ranks receive members of the public, showing a higher effectiveness rate. The number of appointments increased by more than 11 percent last year, exceeding 1 million people. Statistics show that the majority of issues reported by people were resolved. The Prosecutor General personally took charge of the most critical cases. Here is what I would like to say in this connection. There are a number of appeals filed by our citizens concerning the issues they raise regularly but which often take years to resolve– this is what we must focus our attention on. I would like to say that prosecutors' efforts on a specific issue are not always effective for objective reasons or because of[the lack of] funding or because of the regional and local authorities' policies. Nevertheless, members of the prosecution service must work together with regional and municipal teams, involving the federal authorities to deal with the essential aspects of the problems each particular person is facing. I ask you not to take a formal attitude to these matters, limiting your work to reporting on the prosecutor's response measures taken, but to really work towards the settlement of problems at the given level. Next, it is largely thanks to your contribution that the number of unjustified inspections of businesses has decreased. You have cut short the propaganda of extremism in the information space and the illegal activities of some NGOs. The prosecution agencies must continue improving their performance in the key areas, giving more attention to the protection of legitimate civil rights and freedoms, including social and labour rights. Of course, I simply must mention the unprecedented sanctions pressure the Western countries have put on Russia over recent years. As all of us are aware, this pressure increased after we launched the special military operation to support the Donbass people's republics. The Government and our regions are taking large-scale measures to support the citizens of Russia, and we must ensure the uninterrupted operation of these social protection mechanisms at all levels. I am referring, in part, to the timely transfer of pensions, payments and benefits to low-income and large families, and the enhancement of employment assistance programmes. In this connection, I would like to ask prosecutors, acting within the framework of their authority, to develop a special system to oversee compliance with laws during the implementation of support measures for people and all the key, socially-oriented programmes. The state is also there to support the key manufacturing sectors, which employ millions of people in our country. The Russian economy has everything it takes to operate in a stable and uninterrupted manner in this new reality. At the same time, it is the freedom of entrepreneurship and flexible business mechanisms that ensure that the market gets the goods it needs, help mitigate deficits and smooth out price surges. I would like to urge you to make sure that all the rights of entrepreneurs are complied with and to create a business-friendly environment for them. However, if someone abuses their monopoly or engages in behind-the-scenes price-fixing, both the anti-trust watchdogs and the prosecutor's office must respond in a timely and concise manner. Russian businesses have been acting with a lot of dignity these days. Many small and medium-sized companies have yet to recover from the pandemic, but they are now facing new barriers related to the aggression against Russia, which took on the form of sanctions. In fact, aggression through sanctions– this the only way I can define what it is going on. In this situation, we need to do everything to support Russian businesses and use all the available means to this effect, including by reducing the administrative burden. Of course, there are spheres that require inspections, especially on matters affecting people's lives and health. In all other situations, we decided to declare a moratorium. We need to let Russian businesses and those of the foreign companies who continue, against all odds, performing their obligations in good faith, work in peace. We need to shield businesses from excessive, unjustified and unnecessary controls. We have all the instruments we need to do this. Of course, we must be firm in curbing any impairment of rights of businesses receiving state support or preferences. The system to support entrepreneurs must operate in all clarity and create a business-friendly environment. Colleagues, I would like to specifically discuss the tasks facing the prosecution agencies and the entire law enforcement sphere in connection with the special military operation in Donbass and Ukraine. The special operation has exposed multiple violations of international law by Ukrainian neo-Nazi groups as well as foreign mercenaries. We are referring to extreme atrocities such as killing civilians, using people, including children, as human shields, and other crimes. Flagrant provocations against our Armed Forces, also with the use of resources such as foreign media and social networks, also require a thorough investigation. At the same time, it is also necessary to suppress any crimes on the territory of the Russian Federation in the most decisive manner. This morning, the Federal Security Service thwarted a terrorist group that planned to attack and assassinate a well-known Russian television journalist. They will definitely deny this now, but the facts and evidence are irrefutable. In this regard, I would like to say the following. To our surprise, high-ranking diplomats in Europe and the United States are urging their Ukrainian satellites to use their resources to win on the battlefield. Our partners in the United States are using such strange diplomacy– diplomats are even calling for this. But as they realise that this is impossible, they try to achieve a different objective instead– to split Russian society, to destroy Russia from within. But here, too, there is a hitch; this hasn't worked either. Our society has shown maturity and solidarity; it supports our Armed Forces and supports our efforts to ensure Russia's ultimate security and help the people living of Donbass. This actually means support for our people living in Donbass. So when they failed to achieve their information goals– they continued to fool their citizens of course, using their monopoly position in their countries' information space and in some other countries, but they failed here, on the territory of Russia– they switched to terror, to arranging the murder of our journalists. In this regard, it should be noted of course that we know the names of all the Western handlers, of all members of Western services, primarily the CIA, who are working with Ukrainian security agencies. Apparently, they are giving them such advice. This is their attitude towards the rights of journalists, towards the dissemination of information; this is their attitude towards human rights in general. All they care about is their own rights, some cherishing imperial ambitions, others holding on to their colonial past in the old-fashioned way. But this will not work in Russia. I am asking the Investigative Committee of Russia, and all investigative bodies to record such crimes in detail, to identify their masterminds and perpetrators, to initiate criminal cases and bring them to trial, as they should. Prosecutors and investigators should carefully study these and all other facts, collect the necessary evidence to make a case, which should be used in court proceedings, including at the international level. Let me emphasise that such evidence should be accumulated for all the crimes committed by neo-Nazis and their accomplices, starting with the coup d'état in Kiev in 2014, which paved the way for civil war, bloodshed and violence in Ukraine. Next point. We should pay special attention to people arriving to Russia from Ukraine, from the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics. As of today, they number nearly one million, including over 100,000 children. People who had to leave their homes are not always in possession of the documents needed to get material aid, medical support, and to enrol children in schools or kindergartens. I urge the Prosecutor General's Office to render these people legal assistance and protect their rights, including by reviewing their applications within the shortest possible timeframes. It is hard for these people, help them. Colleagues, As before, coordinating the law enforcement agencies in the fight against crime remains among the absolute and most important tasks facing the prosecution service. Yes, the fact that an almost 100-percent solve rate has been achieved with regard to the gravest crimes can be described as a good result. But the statistics are not so good as far as the solve rate for thefts and fraud is concerned. I discussed this in detail at the Interior Ministry's board meeting in February. I would like you to offer proposals on how to change the situation and improve the solve rate for these crimes. The prosecutors should also be more proactive in fighting extremism. It is important to consolidate the positive results achieved in this area and put a firm stop to any actions directed at interfering in Russia's internal affairs from the outside, destabilising our society, and fomenting xenophobia, militant nationalism and interfaith enmity. And, of course, it is necessary to respond without delay to any instances of spreading on the internet radical ideologies and false information that provoke violations of law and order or preparations for illegal actions. They are often organised from abroad, and this is done in different ways, with either information or money coming in from those parts. As before, protecting the rights of minors is among the priorities of the prosecution agencies. It is necessary to follow more closely and impose more severe punishments for crimes committed against children and adolescents, as well as to take additional measures to radically reduce the number of offences in this area, including pre-emptive and preventive measures. Next, we should focus on checking how the federal budget funds are spent, primarily funds allocated for federal and national projects, as part of our fight against corruption. But, of course, we should not forget about the municipal level and the regional level, and also keep an eye on the funds spent to fulfil the state defence order and develop the defence industry. You should pay close attention to some other important areas, including skilled support for government cases in court, environmental protection and management, and oversight of compliance with the rights of inmates of detention facilities. I am confident that the prosecutors are well aware of the scope and importance of the tasks facing their agency and will do all they can for their effective implementation. Colleagues, I want to thank the heads and the personnel of the prosecution service for their dedicated work. I wish you new, significant achievements. Thank you very much."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68260,Telephone conversation with European Council President Charles Michel,2022-04-22T15:25:00Z,NA,Vladimir Putin had a lengthy telephone conversation with President of the European Council Charles Michel.,"The leaders discussed in detail the developments in Ukraine. Charles Michel told Vladimir Putin about his contacts with the Ukrainian leadership during his recent visit to Kiev. Vladimir Putin set forth his fundamental assessments of the special military operation to protect the Donbass republics. He mentioned the order to call off an assault on the industrial zone of the Azovstal plant on humanitarian grounds after the liberation of Mariupol. Moreover, all personnel of the Ukrainian Armed Forces(UAF), militants from nationalist battalions and foreign mercenaries are guaranteed life and dignity in accordance with international law, and qualified medical aid. However, the Kiev regime does not allow them to use this opportunity. The President of Russia told Mr Michel about ongoing measures to protect civilians, daily openings of humanitarian corridors and the announcement of a cease-fire for the safe evacuation of civilians from the zone of hostilities. Attention was drawn to the irresponsible statements by EU officials about the need to resolve the situation in Ukraine by force of arms and their neglect of numerous war crimes of Ukrainian security agencies. It was noted that Brussels could influence the Kiev authorities, compelling them to stop the massive shelling of residential areas in Donbass and refrain from other crude violations of international humanitarian law. In addition, the leaders of the majority of EU countries are taking actions that provoke overt Russophobia, which is manifest in the cultural, humanitarian and sports areas. Responding to Charles Michel's call for direct contact with Vladimir Zelensky, the President of Russia reaffirmed his well-known position on this issue. He noted this opportunity depends, among other things, on the specific results of the talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegates. During these talks, the Ukrainian negotiators have been inconsistent and unwilling to look for mutually acceptable solutions. The conversation also touched upon the issue of ensuring stability and security in Nagorno-Karabakh, in part, with due account of the contacts held recently by Vladimir Putin and Charles Michel with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan. They confirmed the fundamental importance of consistently implementing the key trilateral agreements between Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia of November 9, 2020, and January 11 and November 26, 2021. In this context, Vladimir Putin told Charles Michel about the steps taken to restore economic and transport links, launch the process of delimiting the Armenia-Azerbaijan border, and start talks on a peace treaty between the two countries."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68257,Meeting with Transneft President Nikolai Tokarev,2022-04-21T15:45:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",The President had a working meeting with President of Transneft Nikolai Tokarev.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Tokarev, Transneft holds a special place in the energy sector. How much does it transfer? President of Transneft Nikolai Tokarev: Eighty-three percent of all oil produced in Russia… Vladimir Putin:…passes through the transit system. Nikolai Tokarev: And 30 percent of oil products. Vladimir Putin: So, the company's place is really unique for the entire energy industry. Nikolai Tokarev: Mr President, in terms of Transneft assets, before anything, it is 123,000 professionals working in 64 Russian regions. It is 67,000 kilometres of oil trunk pipelines and more than 500 oil pumping stations. These are enormous figures. The team ensures accurate, steady and reliable operation, performing all obligations with respect to oil transits across Russia and beyond. I should say that this became possible due to the fact that the company has experienced the fastest growth in the past 15 years. The company has completely transformed through this period. We have built 24,500 kilometres of new pipelines, including 10,500 kilometres as part of large significant projects. These include the ESPO-1 and ESPO-2 pipelines(Eastern Siberia– Pacific Ocean), the Baltic Pipeline System-2, the Kuyumba-Taishet and the Zapolyarye– Purpe– Samotlor oil trunk pipelines. We expanded the capacity of the oil product pipeline to Primorsk by 25 million tonnes and carried out total upgrade of all technological processes. I believe that this transformation has brought a very important advantage: today there is no pumping capacity shortage in any direction. In the past, oil companies had to rack their brains and look for ways to export their oil or sell it domestically. Today, the ESPO may be the only project with slight limitations. It is a premium project; everybody wants to use it, so operations are at full capacity. Vladimir Putin: To Asia? Nikolai Tokarev: Yes, to China and the Asia-Pacific. Currently, the second leg of the ESPO pipeline transfers 50 million tonnes of oil and the first leg transfers 80 million, including 30 million to Mohe City, China. During this time, we achieved full import substitution in the production of main line pumps. We used to import them from abroad, sourcing them from Ukraine. Today, we make the entire range of products in this category in Chelyabinsk, at our companies. Our companies manufacture the electric drives and motors for these pumps, giving the company everything it needs. We are now working with the railways to make traction motors for locomotives at our plants. We used to buy turbulent viscosity reducing additives from US companies. Not anymore. Today, we make them in Tatarstan at our plant. This is how we have achieved import substitution for the 29 items included in our programme. I am not even talking about the company's digital transformation. We plan to invest some 30 billion rubles over the next three years in this area. This will enable us to achieve all our planned targets under our programmes. This year, our main objectives include making our oil pipelines more reliable and less prone to accidents. Even today, our accident rate is ten time lower than the global average or the median values, but we want zero accidents. We have this objective and we can deliver on it. It is for this reason that we have earmarked 175 billion rubles in investment for technical retooling, upgrades and capital repairs at our facilities. So far, all this is going as planned. Apart from manufacturing, the company is also serious about its social policy. We operate our own private pension fund, which serves 31,000 retirees. The average corporate pension is 10,000 rubles. We also have a housing policy. We help families with children, offer trips to health resorts, corporate health insurance plans, and promote a healthy lifestyle. We are committed to these priorities. Charity is another priority. Over the past three years, we helped carry out major renovations at 107 schools, mostly in small communities. This included repairs, buying equipment for chemistry, physics and maths classes, computers– everything that is needed for an interesting and well-organised education experience. We carried out repairs at 55 healthcare facilities, including building new rural paramedic centres and renovating outpatient clinics. Mobile clinics are a new area that is dynamically developing at the moment. We assist the regions in buying these mobile clinics, which are based on large trucks. They offer the full range of healthcare services enabling people to undergo medical examination in the most remote areas. We bought two mobile units here in central Russia, to help the Tula Region. In terms of culture, we have been supporting the Moscow Kremlin Museums for quite some time now. Our company fully finances the renovation the Kremlin's Assumption Cathedral. There is also the Tretyakov Gallery. Our subsidiaries do the same kind of work. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68254,Meeting with Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu,2022-04-21T10:00:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu.,"Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu Shoigu SergeiDefence Minister: Mr President, The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and the people's militia of the Donetsk People's Republic have liberated Mariupol. The remaining nationalists are hiding in the industrial area of the Azovstal steel plant. Mariupol is a major industrial centre and the main transport hub on the Sea of Azov. In 2014, the Kiev regime declared the city the temporary capital of the Donetsk Region, and during the subsequent eight years it has been turned into a powerful stronghold and the base of far-right Ukrainian nationalists. In fact, it was the capital of the Azov Battalion. A large amount of heavy weaponry and military hardware have been deployed in the city, including tanks, the Smerch and Uragan multiple rocket launcher systems, heavy artillery systems and the Tochka-U missile complexes. Tochka-U has a range of 120 kilometres, while the distance from Mariupol to Russia's city of Taganrog is 94 kilometres and approximately the same to Rostov, the capital of the Southern Federal District. The city has been stocked with missiles, munitions, fuel and lubricants, and food provisions for lengthy hostilities. The main infrastructure facilities, including the seaport and the waterway, have been mined and blocked with floating cranes. The majority of vessels there belong to foreign states. As for armoured vehicles, there were 179 tanks and armoured fighting vehicles there, 170 various guns and mortars, including multiple rocket launchers which I have already mentioned, the Smerch and Uragan systems. When the city was surrounded on March 11, there were more than 8,100 troops of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and nationalist units in the city, as well as foreign mercenaries, who formed a large group. During the operation to liberate the city, over 4,000 of them have been neutralised, 1,478 have surrendered, and the remaining group of over 2,000 has been blocked in the industrial area of the Azovstal plant. In their resistance efforts, the nationalists used almost all residential buildings as fortified emplacements. Armoured vehicles and artillery were placed on ground floors, and snipers took up positions on upper floors. There were separate units armed with ATGMs as well. The residents were brought to the middle floors and basements and used as human shields. It was done in almost every block of flats. When retreating, the Ukrainian army and the nationalist battalions in Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities were using civilians as a cover. We are aware of four instances when, in order to cover their retreat, they made people leave the basements. The latest incident was literally four days ago, when we were liberating the port area and they made almost everyone leave high-rise buildings so that they could flee leaving behind ruins, including completely destroyed socially important and cultural sites. While liberating Mariupol, the Russian army and the people's militia units from the DPR took every precaution to save civilian lives. Mr President, as you instructed, humanitarian corridors have been created daily since March 21 to evacuate civilians and foreign nationals. Servicemen of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and militants from nationalist battalions were encouraged to lay down their arms. Of course, they were guaranteed life, safety and medical help. We remained in daily communication with Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine[Irina] Vereshchuk with regard to planned humanitarian acts, which included corridors and transport, both ambulances and buses. Occasionally, up to 100 such buses and 25 to 30 ambulances were made available per day. Foreign diplomatic missions got in touch with us in various ways because their nationals were there. By the way, we have been able to free and evacuate many of them from Mariupol as part of these humanitarian initiatives. We provided official notifications to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the relevant OSCE structures, the International Committee of the Red Cross and other international organisations stating the time and place of these initiatives. In some instances, we even insisted on their presence to make sure that all the humanitarian rules are complied with to the extent it was possible, considering the constant and never-ending fire coming from the nationalist battalions and the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Despite the resistance of the fighters and all others, we were able to evacuate 142,711 civilians from Mariupol after you issued instructions to this effect. We freed all hostages at the seaport, including sea crews. Those who took them hostage damaged their communications systems so that they could not get in touch with anyone. The port was mined, and the waterway blocked. I hope that these ships will now be able to leave this port. As of today, the Russian Army and the Donetsk People's Republic's people's militia control all of Mariupol, reliably blocking Azovstal territory with what remains of the nationalist forces and foreign mercenaries. Over the past two days, again as per your instructions, we declared a ceasefire between 2 pm and 4 pm, stopped all military action and opened humanitarian corridors to enable civilians who may be at Azovstal to leave. We prepared about 90 buses for them, and 25 ambulances. Of course, considering all the distortions we face, we installed Russian Aerospace Forces cameras and received the stream almost in real time here at the command centre. No one left Azovstal. However, other civilians, over 100 of them, were able to leave. This was a major effort for us over the past few days, and we carried it out together with all the relevant international organisations. The city is now calm, which allows us to begin efforts to restore order, enable people to return to their homes and bring peaceful life back to the city. As for those hiding at Azovstal, we have reliably sealed its perimeter, and need three or four days to complete this effort at Azovstal. This concludes my report. President of Russia Vladimir Putin: I believe it would be inadvisable to storm this industrial zone. I order you to cancel it. Sergei Shoigu: Yes, sir. Vladimir Putin: This is the case when we have to prioritise preserving the lives and health of our soldiers and officers. Of course, this is our constant priority, but even more so in this case. There is no need to penetrate these catacombs and crawl under these industrial facilities. Seal off the industrial zone completely. Sergei Shoigu: Yes, sir. Vladimir Putin: You must offer all those who have not laid down their weapons to do so. Russia guarantees them their lives and dignity as per the relevant international legal instruments. All the wounded will get medical assistance. You successfully completed the combat effort to liberate Mariupol. Let me congratulate you on this occasion, and please convey my congratulations to the troops. I am also asking you to submit proposals on bestowing state decorations on the service personnel who distinguished themselves. Of course, as usual, there will be various decorations, but I want everyone to know that they are all heroes for us and for all of Russia. In this context, we need to make sure that we fulfil all the social commitments to our service personnel, especially the wounded and the families of our fallen comrades. However, I believe that this would not be enough. We have to do more and come up with additional support measures, and in some case to consider ways of perpetuating the memory of those of our comrades who displayed heroism and sacrificed their lives so that our people in Donbass live in peace and to enable Russia, our country, to live in peace. These people deserved this by what they did and the way they honoured their oath. I am asking you to work on this matter within the Defence Ministry, while I will issue the corresponding instructions to the Presidential Executive Office. I will talk to my colleagues in the regions, and they will work with the municipalities across Russia. Assuming control over Mariupol, a major city in the south of the country, is obviously a success. Congratulations. Sergei Shoigu: Thank you, Mr President."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68251,Meeting on metallurgical complex development,2022-04-20T18:45:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",The President chaired a videoconference meeting on the development of the metallurgical complex.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues. Today, we will review the development of the metallurgical complex, and we will discuss the sector's strategic long-term goals, as well as challenges facing our companies, here with Government members and heads of the business community. I would like to note that Russia is an undisputed leader in the global metallurgical sector, and that it ranks among five largest steel producers. We also hold leading positions in the smelting of a number of non-ferrous metals. Our foreign customers and partners have always seen and continue to see cooperation with Russian metallurgists as predictable and mutually beneficial. At the same time, as we know, the Western states have imposed illegal restrictions on Russian companies. This includes a ban on shipping ready-made products, as well as the purchase of certain components for manufacturing rolled metal products, steel sheets, rods, etc. I would like to note that these measures run counter the principles of the World Trade Organisation, even though our European colleagues have always expressed their commitment to these principles. In this connection, I would like to instruct the Government to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the validity of our Western partners' decisions and to draft an upgraded strategy of our actions in the World Trade Organisation. Please complete this work by June 1, 2022. I would like to add that these unfriendly steps towards Russian metallurgists are only serving momentary political interests. Under this pretext, they have suspended ties that took years to establish and that hinged on reasonable parameters like business reputation, mutual interest and economic efficiency. There was no place for these key concepts, which are crucial to businesses, in the political games of Europe's bureaucrats. To be honest, the interests of European businesspeople who manufacture goods and provide employment in cooperation with Russian companies were ignored and pushed aside. It is obvious that such rough and short-sighted policy will have a negative effect on the European countries' economies, causing metal prices to rise sharply in their markets, something we are already seeing. We have long noted this trend, even before the special military operation in Donbass and Ukraine began. It means that the inflation rate will spike, affecting the wellbeing of European consumers, ordinary citizens. This is the cost of the decisions that were made. I have already said that there is no reason to believe that there will be any essential change in our partners' behaviour. We have to take this into account when implementing our metallurgy development strategy at the corporate and state levels. In view of the latest developments, we must amend the production and supply structure. Businesses are already rebuilding their logistics and production chains and looking for new suppliers and clients in order to keep enterprises working and protect the interests of their staff. I would like to hear opinions in the meeting today on what additional measures are necessary to resolve current industry problems and overcome these challenges. At the same time, we should not forget about the long-term development of the metallurgy industry, the implementation of its future plans, and seek not only to ensure the steady operation of the entire metallurgical complex and to maintain production volumes but to boost production capacity and expand the range of goods produced domestically. I suggest that we discuss a potential industry development model with the business representatives here, based on the current state of affairs and thinking far ahead. I want to stress the importance of domestic demand, which needs to be supported and stimulated – primarily, by expanding the scope of residential, infrastructure, commercial and industrial construction, and by producing more metal-based goods. I want to repeat that long-term projects and programmes are necessary to support the demand for Russian metals. The impact of such projects and programmes will serve the entire economy. It will benefit the Russian regions and their residents. Let's specifically focus on this matter today. Let's begin by giving the floor to Mr Manturov. Please. <…> Vladimir Putin: The metallurgical complex as a whole is one of the most important and largest sectors of Russia's real economy. There are large teams of people working there. In recent years, a lot has been done to promote development, I know this very well, I have visited many enterprises. Vigorous work is underway to develop new technologies, which is impressive, I must say. Taking into account the initiatives that were presented today, I propose updating the Strategy for the Development of Domestic Metallurgy until 2030, by June 1 of this year. Here's what I would ask you to focus on. First. In the coming years, it is necessary to ensure active growth in domestic metal consumption, as we have just discussed in detail. To be clear, this is possible only if prices for products are affordable. Mr Belousov said this quite expressively and clearly. We need to carefully look at the work of the Government and the proposals of the business community. As I have already said, it is important to launch new metal-intensive projects that would have a comprehensive effect on economic sectors, Russian regions, the quality of life, our citizens, in the end. I mean the construction of housing, energy and social infrastructure, railways, bridges, overpasses, and other major projects. We need to step up our efforts in these areas and fine-tune government programmes and support mechanisms. I would ask the Government to work out specific steps in this regard. At the same time, it is important to clearly lay out the targets of the 'construction' in order to set the planning horizon for metallurgical companies and for their investment projects. I would also like to note that the development goals of the mortgage programme for the current year have already been determined. I ask the Government to analyse the situation based on the April results, assess the progress, and make appropriate decisions. Second, it is necessary to specify export areas of Russian metallurgy and redirect flows – as you have just said, colleagues – to promising and dynamic markets. It is clear that a lot depends on the development of the transport infrastructure here. I suggest holding a separate meeting on the Eastern Operating Domain in the near future. It is obvious that in the current conditions this project should move forward at a faster pace. Third, taxation, which companies' representatives spoke about today, and which I asked my colleagues from the Government to comment on. I hope that when preparing the updated Strategy for the Development of Domestic Metallurgy, these differences of opinion – I repeat, we have said this many times today – will be resolved. At the same time, I would like to stress that all decisions here should be linked to long-term strategic plans, both in terms of supply of and demand for metals on the domestic market. And last, metallurgy has its own specifics: the continuity of technological processes. Sometimes they cannot be suspended or put on pause. In this sense, I would like to ask the Government to assist metallurgists in providing them with Russian equipment and consumables, especially those items that are needed, as they say, right now, as well as in the more distant future. And, of course, it is necessary to focus on aligning the demands of metallurgists and infrastructure enterprises. I mean regulating tariffs for services of Russian Railways and energy companies. We have spoken about this just now; we must constantly monitor it. We also need separate and effective approaches here. I am asking the Government to think carefully about this I would like to thank all of you for your work in general and for your work during today's meeting, and express hope that our coordinated efforts today will help the industry to work stably and also ensure its development in the short, medium and long term. We have everything it takes. Thank you very much."

Its training warheads reached the Kura training ground on the Kamchatka Peninsula. The test objectives were carried out in full.*** President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrade officers, My congratulations to you on the successful launch of the Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile. This is a big, momentous event in the development of advanced weapons systems for the Russian Army. The new complex has the highest tactical and technical characteristics and is capable of overcoming all modern means of anti-missile defence. It has no analogues in the world and will not have any for a long time to come. This truly unique weapon will strengthen the combat potential of our Armed Forces, reliably ensuring Russia's security against external threats, and will be a wakeup call for those who are trying to threaten our country in the frenzy of rabid, aggressive rhetoric. I would like to thank all those who took part in developing and producing this new complex, who made an intellectual contribution to resolving the goals set and who translated into reality the ideas of scientists and designers. Thank you very much. I would like to emphasise that only domestic parts and components were used in creating the Sarmat missile. This will, of course, facilitate its production by defence industry enterprises and expedite its use in the Strategic Missile Forces. I would like to thank you for your selfless efforts once again. I wish you new achievements in the name of our Motherland."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68250,Meeting of the Russia – Land of Opportunity Supervisory Board,2022-04-20T15:10:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin held a meeting of the Supervisory Board of the Russia – Land of Opportunity autonomous non-profit organisation in the Kremlin's St Catherine Hall.,"Excerpts from transcript of meeting of ANO Russia– Land of Opportunity Supervisory Board President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, colleagues, good afternoon. We are holding a meeting of the Supervisory Board of the Russia– Land of Opportunity autonomous non-profit organisation. It has been operating for four years now, and over this period hundreds of thousands, millions of people have contributed to its work in one way or another. We have people who are directly involved in various initiatives and their implementation– some of them are here in this hall and some will join us via videoconference. This proved to be a highly relevant, interesting and very useful undertaking. It would be no exaggeration to say that these new projects and ideas have been quite popular among hundreds of thousands of people in Russia. Of course, I would like to thank volunteers for proactively contributing to these efforts. I would also like to note that people who share our vision from across 150 countries contributed to this undertaking in various ways. To be honest, this came as a big surprise to me. This means that there are many people out there who are on the same page as us, who want to walk the same path, to seek development opportunities together, to be friends and support each other. This demonstrates, yet again, that we are on the right track. I do not think that I need any lengthy opening remarks. I will pass the floor to our moderator, who heads this organisation[Alexei Komissarov], and afterwards to other participants. I have no doubt that you have things to share with us. For my part, I will do everything I can to answer your questions and support your ideas. You probably have plenty of them, since you are working on specific projects, which is very important. Please, go ahead. General Director of Russia– Land of Opportunity autonomous non-profit organisation Alexei Komissarov: Thank you very much, Mr President. A year has passed since the previous meeting of the Supervisory Board. All the tasks that we discussed in March 2021 and all the instructions that you issued… Vladimir Putin: So many formalities. Everything must be in order– as it always is in a proper organisation.(Laughter.) Alexei Komissarov: We have come prepared. Vladimir Putin: I understand. Alexei Komissarov: We are successfully fulfilling all the instructions that you issued. Every member of the Supervisory Board can provide an extensive report. The number of participants in this platform has doubled in the past year, exceeding 10 million. Tens of thousands of our winners got accepted to universities, completed internships and found exciting jobs with the best Russian companies, or received study grants and took part in fascinating and informative trips around the country. Before you made a decision to create this kind of platform, sociologists had conducted public opinion polls. In 2017, about 35‒39 percent of the population believed that every person in Russia had opportunities to fulfil their potential. As of the beginning of this year, the number of people who believed and were confident that such opportunities existed reached almost 70 percent. Of course, right now we all are facing new challenges but challenges always present new opportunities. I have no doubts that we can handle any difficulties. Mr President, I am currently training to become a pilot. Planes always take off against the wind. The stronger the wind blows, the faster and higher a plane can soar after take-off. I am confident that we will not only pull through these challenges but will see more Mendeleevs, Popovs, Kulibins and Lobachevskys, and our young people will make many brilliant, great world-class discoveries. We have said many times that people are this country's main asset. So indeed, as you said, let's give these young talents a chance to tell us about their achievements. <…> Ignat Petukhov: My name is Ignat Petukhov, I am Deputy Governor for Economic Policy of the Orenburg Region. If ten years ago somebody told a kid from the small city of Novouralsk that he would have this job in such an important region, I would not have believed them. But Russia is truly a land of opportunity. In 2019, after I won the Leaders of Russia competition, the Governor of the Orenburg Region asked me to join his team and supervise investment. Over three years in the governor's team, we managed to improve our region's investment appeal ranking, from the 52nd to the 16th place, created a special economic zone and launched more than 40 large investment projects. We believe that people are key to the success of any project. Our team includes winners and finalists of various Russia– Land of Opportunity projects. Most importantly, these are people whose leadership potential, professional competencies, knowledge and skills were tested. We had a discussion and we think it would be great to start a staffing agency based on the Russia– Land of Opportunity digital platform, for talented young people who want to build their career trajectory and look for new jobs, and for employers, regional officials and businesses, who want to find talented and creative people with passion in their eyes and, of course, true professionalism. We believe it would be an awesome and amazing initiative. Vladimir Putin: Sounds amazing. You know, it was a matter of time for an initiative like this to emerge. Indeed, we can see, from your own story and from the stories of many other young men and women who participated in these efforts, that this project is really relevant. Why? Because many federal government bodies already… Alexei Komissarov: More than 350 people have already received high-ranking job offers after the Leaders of Russia competition. Vladimir Putin: The project served as an actual social and career lift. The country really needs this. We can see from experience that it works and achieves results– in this case, new staff. Of course, we should review other aspects of this platform because there are also many talented, interesting and creative people there. It is a great suggestion. I am frankly surprised that we have not come up with it ourselves. Thank you. We will do that. Are you in charge of investment? Ignat Petukhov: The economy and investment. Vladimir Putin: What do you think is most important and interesting for the Orenburg Region? Ignat Petukhov: Right now, our local companies are actively working on import substitution. The New Silk Road to China will also pass through our region. Of course, it is a matter of principle to us that we process as much of our own assets(oil, gas and the third largest field in the country) locally. We are launching many projects in the processing industry, including an oil-extracting plant and kaolin(white clay) processing. These projects will, of course, create new jobs and higher wages than in the primary industry. Vladimir Putin: What are the most interesting and important projects as of today? Ignat Petukhov: A large oil-extracting plant, a kaolin(white clay) enrichment factory and a dairy plant. Vladimir Putin: Are these running projects? Ignat Petukhov: These are the projects that are about to be launched. They are entering the construction, assembly or design phase. These are real projects. Vladimir Putin: Excellent, thank you. <…> Diana Krasovskaya: My name is Diana Krasovskaya, I am 12 years old and I am in the seventh grade. I came from Sevastopol. It is a great city, beautiful, comfortable, and special. I have lived there most of my life. Eight years ago my mother, my older brother and I left the city of my childhood, my Lugansk, because the war broke out there and it was very dangerous to stay. I was not even five years old, and I was very afraid of planes overhead and explosions. You know, I still don't like balloons because they explode loudly. I remember how terribly the siren howled, and people began to run. Then I did not understand what was happening, and it was just scary. My life has changed a lot over the last eight years. For the second year running now, I am taking part in the Bolshaya Peremena(The Big Change) contest. Last year I chose the Discover Russia area. Russia is an amazing country, but until now I had no chance to travel around. I thought that there were probably children who have never been to Sevastopol. I wanted to talk about my favourite city, as I see it with my eyes, the eyes of a local. I made a short film about Sevastopol, and a lot of people liked it. It was my first small victory in Bolshaya Peremena. Thanks to the contest, I made a lot of friends from everywhere across Russia, from Moscow to Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk and Kamchatka. These are wonderful, kind, caring people. When they started to evacuate children from the Lugansk and Donetsk regions to Russia this spring, I remembered myself as a little girl. I knew for sure that they needed our help and support, so together with children from Bolshaya Peremena, I launched the Helping Hand campaign throughout the country. We help children from Donbass to get used to their new school groups, assist them with their studies, collect humanitarian aid, stationery; in general, we do everything to make them comfortable. And, by the way, there are entire regional teams of Bolshaya Peremena across the country. Children talk with one another, and we have become one large friendly family. It would be great if a common children's movement arose, which would bring us even closer together. Vladimir Putin: You said a lot has changed in your life in the eight years since you left Lugansk, right? Unfortunately, a lot has changed in the Lugansk People's Republic over those years too, only for the worse, because it has seen bombings, artillery strikes, and hostilities. That, of course, was very, very difficult for people. In Crimea though, in Sevastopol, people's lives have been very different; this much is obvious. But the tragedy that befell Donbass, including the Lugansk People's Republic, has actually made Russia launch this military operation that everyone is well aware of today; that tragedy simply left us no choice. First of all, as I said at the very beginning, the purpose of this operation is exactly to help our people living in Donbass, people like you. We will act consistently and achieve a situation where life will gradually return to normal there, and will change for the better, just as it happened for you, to your life in Sevastopol. And the fact that you and your friends have organised this initiative, Helping Hand, is definitely really great, and I would like to thank you for it. You, like no one else, can understand how important this is for children, for the children from Donbass– from the Lugansk Republic or from the Donetsk Republic. Because they have really found themselves in what we call a difficult life situation; you cannot call it anything else. This is the most difficult life situation. So thank you very much. These kids are probably thanking you too, and their parents, and I want to thank you for this. This is the first point. Second, about launching a children's movement– we have different focus areas. If we stay on the military topic, there is the Yunarmiya(Young Army), and so on. As for an all-Russian movement, of course, we can think about it. It just needs to be done in a non-bureaucratic way, not imposed from the top, rigidly regulated, no. The initiative should come from within, from below, and the only task of the state should be to help and support. Let's think about it from this angle, and the idea is very good. Thank you. Diana Krasovskaya: Thank you very much. I believe that peace will come, thanks to Russia. Vladimir Putin: It will be so. <…> Inna Koroleva: I am Inna Koroleva, a fashion designer, and I am fond of my business. Mine is a robust small business that has provided people with clothing for the last 15 years. I started from scratch without outside investment and today we are creating clothing for thousands of people. I have created a design bureau that has Russia's major companies as clients. Two years ago, I visited Taurida, where I became inspired and launched a fashion brand of my own. It was profitable within a year; more than that, it has helped us to weather the COVID-19 pandemic. Today, everyone is asking whether we will be able to replace imports. My reply is: we are ready. You know, my dream is that at long last, it will be fashionable and prestigious to wear what Russian designers and producers have to offer. I would like to suggest that the words""Made in Russia"" become a brand and mark of quality both in this country and all over the world. This is my first point. Of course, we will have to make up for a lot of things that have been lost. I mean fabrics, skilled personnel, and more. Young people need support too. Second, I would like to invite you to Taurida so that you can see how many creative and talented young people there are in this country, people we can work with. Third, I would like to present this jacket to you. We have made it at our factory with our own hands. We will pass it to you later. Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much. What you are doing certainly can and should be absolutely successful in terms of import substitution. It is necessary to give more attention, time, money, and government support to creating the relevant materials, fabrics, and equipment. But in the final analysis, your success is based on creative principles, and these creative principles are in rapport with the general culture of society, where these developments are taking place. What I mean is: it is no coincidence that some European countries like France or Italy have famous fashion houses. Why? Because this creative principle is rather well developed over there. I am referring to pictorial art and other arts. This has a direct bearing on fashion design activity. In this sense, we have a huge potential, because there are many talented and creative people brought up– this is the gist of the matter– on Russian culture, which is certainly a part of world culture– one of the most important parts of world culture. This is the main thing: this stratum is very deep here. True, we will have to make an additional effort to develop technologies and materials. But, I repeat, we have very many talented people. As for fashion design, I am now certain that it is a kind of art, although, honestly speaking, I did not think so before. As far as state support is concerned, we will certainly render it. Right now, I will not enumerate all types of support for small and medium-sized businesses. You are undoubtedly in the small and medium-sized business category. We will think about this and will offer solutions. We will develop them in every way. If some companies are leaving our market, they should know that nature abhors a vacuum. I look forward to Russian designers and producers filling this vacuum. We will help them. <…> Vladimir Putin(Commenting on a narrative by Marat Naskhutdinov from Ufa, who won the Masters of Hospitality competition, on how he is developing the Bashkir national fast food industry. He said that major foreign fast food chains are now leaving the Russian market, but that no one will go hungry, and that he was ready to address this issue.) In the broader context of implementing your initiatives, I can tell you that many say they are leaving the Russian market, but they stay. Marat Naskhutdinov: Yes, I have noticed. Vladimir Putin: Indeed, major opportunities will open up if they leave, and the market will accommodate new players. I am 100 percent confident that the substitution of foreign owners and manufacturers will improve the quality of services for Russian citizens. I am 100 percent confident. We should face the facts: many of them use Russian foodstuffs and this is true. About 50, 60 and sometimes 90 percent of foreign owners of these fast food companies use Russian food products. They did the right thing because the quality of these foods is much better than in Europe because European outlets use too many chemicals, pesticides, etc. Russia has much tougher standards for using these preparations. In any event, we will support the development of these projects; to the best of my knowledge, tax benefits were introduced from January 1 this year, VAT liability has been suspended, and we will continue to search for other incentives to promote these activities because it includes a sphere that remains in high demand every day. All Russian citizens need this because everyone needs to eat several times a day. Consequently, your work is important. We realise that, especially during the pandemic period, many companies have found themselves in a difficult financial situation, and we intend to continue supporting all aspects of organising the restaurant sector. There are various proposals and ideas for new projects, and much has already been done. We will certainly continue to keep this in mind; we will assist you in every way we can. Marat Naskhutdinov: Thank you very much. Vladimir Putin: Speaking of Russia's national cuisines, this is also part of our culture. I am not kidding. A national cuisine is part of every nation's culture and a distinguishing feature of any nation or ethnic group. Russia offers great cultural diversity, and cuisines are always at hand and are always around. As I said, this is part of any nation's culture. This is very interesting and delicious, and I would be happy to order something. Marat Naskhutdinov: Thank you, we will deliver your order. Vladimir Putin: Do you send orders elsewhere? I will order something; it's not hard to do in Ufa. Marat Naskhutdinov: So far, we only deliver food in Ufa, but we can send your order to Moscow. Vladimir Putin: I will certainly try your food. Thank you very much. <…> Alexei Komissarov: You said in the beginning that people from 150 countries participated in the international track of the Leaders of Russia contest. We were, of course, amazed by the fact that 70 people came to compete in the contest's final stage, which was held just recently, in late March, despite all the obstacles and barriers, logistical challenges and other issues they had to face in their countries. I would like to pass the floor to Mikhail Goryanoi. He is a German national, works in China, and won the Leaders of Russia international track. Vladimir Putin: You said he works in China? Mikhail Goryanoi: Indeed. I have been working there for a long time now. Vladimir Putin: Ni hao. Mikhail Goryanoi: Ni hao. Good afternoon, Mr President. In fact, I have been waiting for the opportunity to take part in the international track of the Leaders of Russia contest for a very long time. Thank you so much for this opportunity. I have been following this contest for quite some time, so when I got this opportunity, I had no doubt that I wanted to be part of it. I instantly found myself in a very competitive environment, since I was among 10,000 contestants who registered for the international track. And I know very well what it means to be in a competitive environment, since I studied in Germany, at the University of Bonn. Nobel Prize winner Reinhard Selten taught us, so there was a lot of competition among students from day one. As for the contest itself, it started with online stages, after which the finalists gathered at the Pashkov House in Moscow. I came there from China, where I have been living for quite a while now. I also lived in Japan for some time, and learned some Japanese. Vladimir Putin: But how did you find yourself in Germany? Mikhail Goryanoi: My parents made this decision. Vladimir Putin: When did you leave, what year? Mikhail Goryanoi: Back in 1999. I was born in Dnepropetrovsk, USSR. Vladimir Putin: I see. Then you went on to work in China and Japan? For how long? Mikhail Goryanoi: I completed my studies in Germany, then lived in Japan for some time, mostly studying, and then went back to Germany. I started working in China long before it became mainstream. The way China transformed itself… Vladimir Putin: What do you do in China? Mikhail Goryanoi: I started in marketing, helping Chinese companies tap European, African, Asian, Russian and CIS markets. I chose this path and created my own business down the road. I worked for state corporations, including in the metals sectors, and in a number of other industries. All these aspirations came together to form a kind of synergy. I have been witnessing China's development over this time. It has been developing at an astonishing pace. We all know that outside forces wanted to stop this growth and development, but China withstood this pressure. In this sense, I believe that this resonates with the current situation. I have a feeling that China and its people really respect Russia for its commitment to an independent policy and following its own course. In this context, both my experience and that of China could be very useful and relevant today. I have been working with Russian exporters for a long time, as well as with entire regions seeking to gain a foothold in the Chinese market. I think that experience in entering the Chinese market and harnessing the export potential, fully unlocking it and generating further momentum is extremely useful and relevant today, since many people, companies and even regions now want to work with China without necessarily understanding how to do it. Vladimir Putin: Logistics really matter. Logistics, plus knowing local laws. Mikhail Goryanoi: So, we are overcoming language barriers: enough Russians speak Chinese and enough Chinese people speak Russian. We have apps and computer models. However, some cultural barriers still remain. There is a common language denominator, but there are also cultural and regulatory aspects that we need to explain in greater detail. I think that these efforts are not always timely. This is the first point. There is also personal experience. I often get in close contact with our fellow Russians abroad. More and more frequently they express willingness to return to Russia, to work and live in Russia, to work for the benefit and prosperity of Russia. But they constantly have doubts. And I really wish my example were an example for them because the Leaders of Russia contest has been a kind of culmination of my long way home. And it would be really nice if I could motivate fellow Russians around the world to do the same. Vladimir Putin: So, now you live in Moscow, don't you? Mikhail Goryanoi: For a month now. I know that for the majority of my colleagues, it was rather difficult, especially in the current circumstances, to move back, logistically and for other reasons. However, we did our best and around 70 people eventually made it back to Moscow. Vladimir Putin: Do you find your place in this? It is a tremendous amount of work. I will not go into detail. You know it yourself. China is our biggest trade and economic partner among foreign countries, with more than $100 billion in mutual trade. And that does not include major projects related to oil, gas, aviation, machine engineering, nuclear energy and other industries. But in today's conditions, small and medium-sized businesses have many opportunities to join a great variety of projects, on both sides. Do you see yourself here, building this cooperation? Mikhail Goryanoi: I believe that my experience is quite extensive and could be useful here. If you give permission, I will be happy and ready to offer my experience in this area. In addition to sharing my experience, I would like people around the world who want to come back to Russia to realise that it is possible, it is needed, helpful and noble. I think in that, I succeeded. Vladimir Putin: I want to wish you all the best. These efforts are indeed needed and noble. They must be relevant to certain people. You seem to have found your place. This is a mainstream area, no doubt about that. Many people who come back– and there are quite a few– work in education and science. For our part, we must create conditions for the people who want to work here and fulfil their potential. We must do it. Of course, a person's success also depends on their own efforts. They need to find their niche. I hope you have found it or will find it. We will do what we can to support you. Mikhail Goryanoi: Thank you, I appreciate it. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Good luck. <…> Vladimir Putin(commenting on the idea of Lipetsk teacher Alla Volkova to spread the experimental post of School Director Adviser on Education throughout Russa): As for school director advisers on education, the experiment is underway in 10 Russian regions and is to be spread to 35 regions next year– Mr Kravtsov will correct me if I am wrong in this regard. Overall, it should be put into effect throughout the country. Mr Kravtsov, please. Minister of Education Sergei Kravtsov Kravtsov SergeiMinister of Education: Yes, Mr President, you are absolutely right. We can see that the atmosphere in schools is changing, with a caring attitude to extracurricular activities leading to the establishment of new hobby groups and sports sections. In other words, this work should proceed on a larger scale, first in 35 regions and then throughout the country. Vladimir Putin: Well, I would like to say that it is a very difficult job. In the current conditions, when schoolchildren have unlimited access to the internet, it is very difficult to help our young people find their bearings in the ocean of information. In this situation, school director advisers on education must themselves satisfy the high requirements set to their attitude to and work with the people, with young people and schoolchildren, so that these advisers are more interesting than the internet and the buckets of grisly information it provides. It is a very difficult job, and we need people who are clearly aware of the importance of their work and the responsibility this involves. We need people who are enthusiastic, or there will be problems, because simple rubberstamping will damage the project and compromise its idea. Therefore, I would like to ask Mr Kravtsov and all our other colleagues in this sphere to keep this in mind. It is not just another line in the list of positions; educating our children is a special and extremely important mission. Of course, education should begin in the family, but children spend so much time at school, which is why we need people they can respect, people who can awaken their interest, get children involved and become an authority for them. I know that this is difficult to do, especially in a world taken over by the internet. But we must do it. I agree that we must not let things take their course. We must help our young people find their bearings in the barrage of information, help them see the main elements, the reference points and top priorities, shut out things of secondary importance, separate lies from the truth, and see the real values. It is a challenging job. We need enthusiastic people. I strongly hope that we will succeed. Alexei Komissarov: Let us also give the floor to our final participant, Dmitry Cheshev. Dmitry is the winner of our TopBLOG contest. Dmitry, please. Dmitry Cheshev: Good afternoon, Mr President. Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Dima. Dmitry Cheshev: Today bloggers– and I am from the TopBLOG project– are very concerned that the world of social media is changing: some platforms are being replaced by others. Of course, everyone is afraid that they will lose their audiences. We were taught at the TopBLOG project that the main thing is not the number of subscribers but the value you have. If you are really sincere, useful and interesting, people will stay with you. I think you understand this very well. I started my blog in 2021, when I became disabled. I am an athlete; I was doing a usual somersault in the gym, then an unsuccessful fall, a broken neck, and spinal cord injury. In an instant, I was paralysed. In my blog, I talk about life, motivation, and how I am learning to walk again. My story inspires many people. Many of them do not have any health problems but everyone has a dream. Strength is necessary to achieve this dream. I help them to find this strength. I am also very inspired and motivated by these activities. Today I cannot give it up because subscribers need my experience. It is generally believed that bloggers mostly entertain and do something for hype, but today teachers and doctors become bloggers and they create truly important social content, they educate and help people. In today's situation, they also need our help and support, so, as they say, friends, like and subscribe to such useful bloggers, because we need to attract maximum attention to such people who make meaningful content now, at this moment. It would be even better if we could gather them together. These are thousands of talented and ambitious people who change the life of the country and each one of us every day. Next year the Russia– Land of Opportunity forum turns five, and if it is possible to organise a large forum that we could all attend, everyone who graduated over these five years. These people would exchange experience and knowledge, but most importantly, I am sure they would definitely come up with new ideas on how to improve the life of the country. Vladimir Putin: Good idea. Dima. Can I ask you a question? What sports did you do and where did you get injured? Dmitry Cheshev: I was a swimmer and I was injured during a training session, let us say gymnastics training for swimming, among other things, during a usual somersault. You know, there is a saying: if I knew where I'd fall, I'd put straw there. It was an excellent gym, with great safety standards, but, as they say, nothing can guarantee you 100 percent safety, so this happened. Vladimir Putin: Unfortunately, this happens in sports. A university friend of mine died at a competition, when he was performing a forward throw. It happens, unfortunately. But it is great that you have found yourself despite this major injury. As I understand, you have a very complicated competitive environment, because, I am sorry, but it is very easy to engage in smear practices online, and, regrettably, this ease helps to attract subscribers in droves. But the wish to make money at any cost, including on advertisements, by drawing a certain number of people, this type of activity, cannot, of course, be called noble. It is clear why, so there is no need to go into detail. But if a person like you is able to fascinate your subscribers with interesting, beautiful and understandable ideas or projects, this is different and requires peace of mind and a high level of training– broad-based knowledge, high inner culture, and, of course, expertise. If people like you succeed in winning subscribers over from those who engage in smear practices, this is, without any exaggeration, a matter of national importance. We must do all we can to support people like you, doing this meticulously, unobtrusively, and without reliance on any additional administrative resources, and we will try to do this. Dmitry Cheshev: There are a great many people of this kind– teachers, who educate people, doctors, scientists… They inspire others so much that people want to follow them. Vladimir Putin: Yes, I know. Dmitry Cheshev: Everyone wants attention. I urge everyone: do pay attention to them, because they are working for a very important cause. This is my first point. Second, at this turning point, they need your attention, but later they will be helping you by educating and inspiring you and by giving you the knowledge that you will never obtain anywhere else. Vladimir Putin: Yes, you are right. I fully subscribe to this. I also subscribe to your proposal to hold at a good level an event dedicated to the fifth anniversary of the Russia– Land of Opportunity platform. To all of you, I would like to wish success and I want to thank you for your work– both those who are present here now, at the Kremlin's St Catherine Hall, and those who are in contact with us in the regions of the Russian Federation. Thank you very much and all the best. Thank you. Goodbye."

It included a joint statement by the leaders of both states, an inter-governmental agreement on cooperation in information security and a number of documents, signed by relevant agencies of both sides, on cooperation in the legal, cultural, social and labour spheres, and on plant quarantine measures. A comprehensive programme for Russian-Armenian cooperation in the field of energy and non-energy projects was also approved.*** President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, It is a pleasure to see you. Your visit marks the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our countries. I know your itinerary here is quite extensive and includes meetings with senior officials from the Government, the Federal Assembly and a trip to Nizhny Novgorod. The signing of several documents is planned, to be added to a rather substantial base. In recent years, we have signed 200 bilateral documents to regulate our legal relations, enabling us to cooperate in almost all areas. Obviously, the economy is one of the leading fields. Our mutual trade grew by 12.8 percent in 2021. During the first months of 2022, it additionally grew by 50 percent. This is a pretty good result, especially in the current conditions. Today, we will also discuss security, including Karabakh. I agree that many issues remain to be resolved. We maintain constant contact. We speak over the phone every week or every ten days. We also meet regularly, despite the ongoing pandemic. I am very happy to see you. Welcome. Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan Pashinyan NikolPrime Minister of the Republic of Armenia: Thank you. Mr President, First of all, I would like to thank you for inviting me on an official visit to the Russian Federation. As you have said, this visit is not just a practical one, but it also has a symbolic significance, because it has been timed to the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our countries and is evidence of the high standards of our bilateral relations. I hope that this visit will help maintain and even accelerate the development of our ties. We maintain regular contact; indeed, we meet often and have regular telephone conversations partly because we have a busy agenda of bilateral relations in virtually all spheres, from the economy to culture, education and military-technical cooperation. Russia is Armenia's strategic ally and partner. We are effectively cooperating in the Eurasian Economic Union, the CIS and the Collective Security Treaty Organisation. It is clear to everyone that Russia plays a key role in ensuring stability and security in our region. I would like to point out again the exceptional role you played in stopping the shooting and hostilities in Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020. Since then, Russian peacekeepers have been deployed in Nagorno-Karabakh. It is notable that, overall, the Russian peacekeepers are maintaining security in the region. However, we need to consider ways to make their operations more effective. Of course, the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh problem is the main political issue in our region. I am sure that we will be able to discuss it today. It is true that the itinerary of my visit is very ambitious, but many of the issues have to do with our talks and our meeting today. I am sure that our talks will be productive. Once again, thank you. It is a pleasure to meet with you again. Vladimir Putin: You mentioned cooperation in culture. We have timed the Days of Armenian Culture in Russia and the Days of Russian Spiritual Culture in Armenia to your visit and the 30th anniversary of our diplomatic relations. I believe this will also draw public attention and will be very useful."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68228,Meeting on economic issues,2022-04-18T15:10:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region","The President held a meeting on economic issues, via videoconference.","Taking part in the meeting were Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Anton Vaino, First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov, Presidential Aide Maxim Oreshkin, Minister of Economic Development Maxim Reshetnikov, Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov, and Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina. * * * The President's opening remarks President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, good afternoon. Today's agenda includes a review of the current economic situation in Russia and its main trends. We will discuss what additional measures are needed in the current environment to support Russian businesses, manufacturers, industries and, of course, people. It is obvious that the pressure from sanctions, yet more pressure from sanctions imposed by Western countries has been the main negative factor for the economy lately. They expected еру sanctions to rapidly produce a devastating effect on Russia's finances and economy, sow panic in the markets, bring about a collapse in the banking system and create major shortages of goods in shops. However, we can already say in all confidence that this policy has failed in Russia. The strategy of unleashing an economic blitzkrieg has been ineffective. Moreover, the sanctions affected those who initiated them. I am referring to higher inflation and unemployment and the worsening economic outlook for the United States and European countries, as well as the declining living standards of Europeans and the depreciation of their savings. As I have already said, Russia has been able to withstand this unprecedented pressure. The situation is getting back to normal with the ruble recovering to where it was in the first half of February, which is attributable to a robust trade surplus, which is an objective reality. In the first quarter, the current account surplus exceeded $58 billion, setting a historical high. Foreign cash is returning to the banking sector and household deposits are growing. As for the consumer market, retail demand has stabilised after a brief period of panic buying, which does happen in situations like this. Retail chains are restocking their supplies. Let me note that we were right to refrain from shifting market regulation into a manual, artificial mode. Instead, we gave businesses the liberty to come up with appropriate and effective solutions. These decisions enabled us to keep retail chain supplies flowing and ensure the availability of essential goods in the shops. I would like to say a few words about the inflation rate. It is stabilising now, but nevertheless you and I know very well that consumer prices have grown considerably in Russia over the past six weeks, by 9.4 percent, which means that yearend inflation as of April 8 was 17.5 percent. Our colleagues in the Government and the Central Bank should know that we are fully aware of what is happening: the inflation rate is very high. People have felt the impact on their family incomes, they notice how prices have risen, and we must help our citizens deal with this wave of inflation. In this context, I would like to remind you that a decision has been taken to adjust all social benefits, pensions and wages in the public sector, in accordance with inflation. The parameters of this adjustment are to be prepared by the Government. Of course, the main condition for a real increase in our citizens' incomes is the creation of new and well-paid jobs, the acceleration of the economic growth rate, and the development of industry and other sectors. Overall, the current situation is stable in this regard, as we can see from the electricity production index. This indicator is very good, which points to the dynamic development of the economy. And the number of registered unemployed is relatively low. We certainly need to constantly monitor the situation in the economy and the employment market and, in general, we need to keep abreast of the developments, as well as take prompt decisions to ensure the stable and confident operation of our businesses and entrepreneurs. Thus far, the Government and the Central Bank have been doing this successfully. Today I would like to ask our colleagues from the Central Bank and the Government to tell us about their vision for the development of the national economy and the measures we must take to prevent a potentially adverse situation in the economy and setbacks for Russian companies, enterprises and citizens. Before we move on to the agenda, I would like to mention the issues that I would like to pay particular attention to today. The first is foreign trade. The restrictions against Russia imposed by unfriendly countries have affected Russian businesses, and, of course, complicated the logistics of exports and imports and created obstacles to making settlements. It is necessary to provide entrepreneurs with as much assistance as possible in dealing with these issues, including speeding up the transition of foreign trade to rubles and the national currencies of countries that are Russia's reliable business partners. I want to emphasise that in the new, changed environment, we need to do this much faster. I would like you to report today on how this work is being organised and what results you plan to achieve. Second, it is crucially important to support domestic demand and prevent it from shrinking. It is necessary to act both through the budgetary system and to provide businesses with greater access to loans. This is the responsibility of the Central Bank. The bank has already begun lowering the interest rate, which will reduce the future cost of loans in the economy. As for the budget, I know about the discussions between the Central Bank and the Government, taking place amid a fall in lending; nevertheless, the budget definitely should actively support the economy, fill it with financial resources, maintain its liquidity. We have the capacity for that. Of course, one needs to act with caution; the Minister and I constantly discuss this. Nevertheless, in the first quarter of this year we are witnessing a record level of budget surplus. We require additional solutions here, and they have to be implemented when the economy needs them the most. It is necessary to be cautious, and as I see it, the key condition is that the financial system remains stable at the federal and regional levels. What is our current surplus? I believe it is some 1.1 trillion rubles, and the total surplus in the regions is about 0.9 trillion rubles. So, I suggest we discuss the budget policy in detail today. Let us begin. Ms Nabiullina, please, you have the floor. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68191,Meeting on current situation in oil and gas sector,2022-04-14T17:15:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region","Vladimir Putin held a meeting on the current situation in the oil and gas sector, via videoconference.","The meeting was attended by Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Anton Vaino, First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, Presidential Aides Igor Levitin and Maxim Oreshkin, Minister of Natural Resources and Environment Alexander Kozlov, Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov, Minister of Economic Development Maxim Reshetnikov, Minister of Transport Vitaly Savelyev, Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov, Minister of Energy Nikolai Shulginov, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina and representatives of the oil and gas sector. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues. We are continuing a series of industry-specific meetings, and today we will review the situation in the oil and gas sector. We will discuss its long-term development plans and approaches to resolving problems faced by the companies in this sector as a result of actions by the so-called unfriendly states. As we have said many times, the most urgent problem here is the disruption of export logistics. I would like to ask you to describe specifically what action are you taking to adjust transport chains and overcome the rising logistics costs. Furthermore, there are setbacks in payments for Russian energy exports. Banks from these unfriendly countries are delaying the transfer of funds. I will remind you that our aim is to convert payments for energy resources into national currencies and to gradually depart from dollars and euros. In general, we intend to drastically increase the share of settlements in national currencies in our foreign trade system. Important steps are already being taken in this area, and the key task is to prepare our currency market for this transition and enable customers to exchange any foreign currency for the required amount of Russian rubles. As I have said, giving up unreliable, compromised currencies and jurisdictions is a strategic goal for the financial and economic security of our country, which is important for the preservation and strengthening of our foreign trade, and for the development of stable ties with predictable partners who are true to their word, value their reputation and are aware of the consequences of their decisions. Here is what I would like to say in this connection. Russian energy companies are responsible players on the global market. Their reputation rests on decades of business activity and strict compliance with their obligations. The Western countries' attempts to push out Russian suppliers and to replace our energy resources with alternative supplies will inevitably affect the global economy as a whole. The consequences of this may be extremely painful, primarily for the initiators of the policy. It is surprising that our so-called partners from the unfriendly countries admit that they cannot do without Russian energy resources, for example, gas. There is no reasonable alternative to Russian gas in Europe. Yes, it is possible to replace Russian gas, but not right know, which is clear to everyone. There are no uncontracted volumes of gas on the global market, and deliveries from other countries to Europe, primarily from the United States, will cost consumers several times more – I repeat, several times more – and will have a negative effect on people's living standards and the competitiveness of the European economy. Despite these obvious facts, European countries keep saying that they will abandon Russian gas supplies, which is further destabilising the market and increasing prices, primarily for their own citizens. Moreover, they are ready to abandon the so-called green agenda and resume their reliance on energy with a so-called high carbon footprint, which until recently they wanted to shut down completely as out-of-date and dirty. Many political forces used environmental slogans in their election campaigns. Where is all of this now? It has been thrown on the scrapheap, and they are now acting quite differently. Initially, serious specialists and analysts issued warnings, and they did so publicly, that an accelerated ""green transition"" cannot be made in practice without huge losses. This is just what happened in reality. Now they have a wonderful excuse to cover up their own miscalculations and blame everything on Russia. Importantly, these are miscalculations not only as regards energy but also in many other areas. Of course, we must take into account the ambivalence and continuously changing policies of certain countries. That said we must be guided – now and for years ahead – by our own interests. In this context, our oil and gas industry is facing three tasks. First, we must ensure sustainable energy supplies for our domestic market. Moreover, in conditions when external markets are shrinking, it is important to increase supplies to Russian consumers. To encourage domestic demand, we must seek price reductions whenever possible. Second. We must diversify exports. Let us assume that energy supplies to the West will continue going down in the foreseeable future. Therefore, it is important to consolidate the trend of the past few years: to redirect our exports gradually to the rapidly growing markets of the South and the East. To achieve this, we must determine the key infrastructure facilities and start their construction in the near future. Third, we must develop deep processing of oil and gas. We have already made much progress in this area. We have implemented major projects and put modern plants into operation. Now we must provide additional support for the investment-stage projects in order to launch them into production as soon as possible. And, of course, import substitution for oil and gas production equipment requires special attention. It is important for both operating deposits and for developing new fields, including those in the Arctic, as we discussed with several colleagues recently. I will remind you that this Commission reviewed a detailed plan for import substitution for the development of the fuel and energy sector in late 2015. I suggest discussing whether the adopted decisions were effective and what problems and bottlenecks remain in this area. Let us review this set of issues, adjust our work and set benchmarks for developing our fuel and energy sector. I give the floor to Alexander Novak. <…> Vladimir Putin: I would like to thank everyone for their proposals and ask my colleagues from the [Presidential] Executive Office to incorporate them in the final document following our meeting today. Above all, I would like to ask the Government to take the results of today's discussion into account when drafting the Energy Strategy of Russia. As we agreed, its planning horizon must be extended until 2050, and the strategy must be adopted by September 15. What priorities must be considered when drafting this document? First, it is necessary to expand the regional gas supply programme and change approaches to its implementation so that it covers as many regions, localities and households as possible. This task is quite specific: gas – either pipelined or liquefied – should reach the consumer wherever possible. Second, regardless of external conditions, it is necessary to ensure a sufficient supply of petroleum products on the domestic market, and at affordable prices: for car owners, transport companies and businesses, including agricultural ones. All additional decisions in this regard must also be set out. Let me add that large-scale plans on the development of petrochemistry and natural gas conversion have already been drafted and are being implemented; it is very important to focus on this. I also mean the non-market restrictions we are facing. We need to see them through, these projects, and move forward in strengthening and building up the potential of these important sectors of the economy. Third. Energy exports. It is necessary to speed up the implementation of infrastructure projects – on railways, pipelines and ports – which will make it possible to redirect the supplies of oil and gas from the West to promising markets in the South and the East in the next few years. At the same time, it is important to look towards the future. We need to draw up plans with oil and gas companies for expanding the export infrastructure to countries in Africa, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific region. Among other things, we need to plan the construction of new oil and gas pipelines from the fields in Western and Eastern Siberia – exactly what we have just discussed at the end of our meeting; to boost the capacity for oil transshipment in Arctic and Far Eastern ports – also a very important part of Northern Sea Route development; as well as to include the Power of Siberia and Sakhalin-Khabarovsk-Vladivostok gas pipelines in the Unified Gas Supply System to distribute gas to the regions in that part of the country. I am asking the Government to draft a long-term plan for the development of oil and gas transit infrastructure; it should be ready by June 1 of this year. Please do not delay this. I am asking the Government to include businesses and the Institute for Initiatives in Oil and Gas Technologies – we also spoke about this – in planning the transition from foreign standard and certification systems in the gas and petrochemical industry to domestic systems. This must be done without delay – before the end of this year. Next. To stimulate import substitution in the oil and gas and petrochemical industries, we need to clearly understand our companies' needs and interests. In this regard, I consider it expedient to work out options for consolidating demand and resources in this field, to put together a kind of umbrella package of orders for the design and manufacturing of the types of products, machinery and equipment that all our energy companies need. These are the objectives that we must direct our efforts and resources towards first. We also spoke about bank clearing and discussed this working group Elvira Nabiullina proposed at one of our meetings. We will establish this in the near future and continue this work. I would like to thank all the participants in today's meeting and discussion. I think it was quite substantive and specific and, I am sure, will benefit the industry. Thank you very much. All the best, everyone. Thank you."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68188,Meeting on Arctic zone development,2022-04-13T14:35:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region",Vladimir Putin chaired a videoconference meeting on the development of the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation.,"Attending the meeting were: Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Anton Vaino, Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation and Chairman of the Security Council's Inter-Departmental Commission for Ensuring the National Interests of the Russian Federation in the Arctic Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, Deputy Prime Minister – Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoy to the Far Eastern Federal District and Chairman of the State Commission for Arctic Development Yury Trutnev, Presidential Aides Igor Levitin and Maxim Oreshkin, federal ministers and heads of Russian regions, Special Presidential Representative for Environmental Protection, Ecology and Transport Sergei Ivanov, Special Presidential Representative for International Cooperation in the Arctic and Antarctica Arthur Chilingarov, and the heads of the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring and Rosatom * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues. Today, we will discuss the development of the Arctic zone of Russia. We have always prioritised efforts to accomplish social, economic and infrastructure tasks in this highly important region and to implement large-scale investment projects there. This remains a priority. Hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens live and work in Arctic territories, and virtually all aspects of this country's national security, including the environmental, natural resources, military-political and technological dimensions, are concentrated here. I want to note right away that, considering all kinds of external restrictions and sanctions pressure, we need to focus on all projects and plans linked with the Arctic. We must not shelve or delay them; on the contrary, we must expedite our work on current and long-term tasks to the greatest possible extent, in response to attempts to hamper our development. Above all, this concerns the social sphere. We should always focus on matters that are most sensitive for people. Under the extreme conditions of the Arctic, people's health and security are at stake, as well as the survival of entire towns and settlements. As you may know, the actions by the unfriendly countries have disrupted a number of transport and logistical chains. Certain foreign companies are not meeting their contractual obligations in full or not at all. There is no doubt that in the existing situation this is creating certain difficulties for us. But we have all the resources and every opportunity to enable us to find alternative solutions in no time, and to strengthen our independence from external factors to an even greater extent in the long term. This is an extremely important task. To this end, all responsible agencies employed in the Arctic should competently and quickly reorganise their operations, primarily in order to ensure that residents of Arctic territories, rotation workers, businesses and social institutions in the region obtain an uninterrupted supply of food, medicines, fuel, building materials, and equipment. As a reminder, the start of the northern supply haul is close at hand. The haul should proceed in a well-managed and organised manner, in accordance with the schedule and without setbacks. The Arctic should be supplied with all the necessary goods and services – and in full. This is of fundamental importance in order to guarantee price stability in populated Arctic localities. A list of ships to be employed in the haul and their sailing plan should be compiled as soon as possible. Their priority departure from ports should be ensured as should a more active use of air transport. I suggest we think of appointing a single operator in the area of maritime delivery of cargoes under the northern supply programme, one involving icebreaker support. Generally, we should clearly identify a northern supply coordinator in the form of a relevant agency and, of course, invest it with all powers and responsibilities. Please submit concrete proposals for this later today. Let me add the following. I urge the Government and the heads of the Arctic regions to take special responsibility for the smooth construction or renovation of social facilities – kindergartens, schools, hospitals, and rural medical and obstetric stations. Everything envisaged by our programmes and national projects should be implemented. Another goal towards which we must work proactively is the implementation of priority investment projects. This will determine the further development of the Arctic regions and the well-being of their residents, the preservation of jobs and the creation of new jobs, as well as the fulfilment of Russia's commitments to reliable business partners. It is obvious that today many projects should be adjusted, that they need additional support and flexible, out-of-the-box solutions when it comes to funding, technologies and the supply of materials, construction equipment and component parts. Today I would like to hear your reports on plans for the failsafe adoption of pivotal comprehensive initiatives, which should be done at a normal working pace to ensure the further development of business activity in the Arctic, including support for small and medium-sized businesses. I would like to emphasise once again that several Western countries' rejection of normal cooperation, including at least part of Russian energy resources, has hit back at millions of Europeans, has led to a real energy crisis and, incidentally, is affecting the United States. Prices are growing everywhere, and the inflation rate is soaring, which is a completely unprecedented situation for these countries. Of course, we are facing problems as well, but we also have alternatives, new options and new windows of opportunity. As for Russian oil, gas and coal, we can increase their consumption on the domestic market, stimulate the value-added conversion of raw materials and also boost energy deliveries to the parts of the world that really need them. To achieve this goal, we will make use of all the available opportunities, including the development of transport corridors like the Northern Latitudinal Railway. The active construction phase of this railway project is scheduled to begin as early as this year. I would like to draw the attention of the Government, RZD, Gazprom and other companies that are involved in this project to the fact that this is a direct instruction, and that is how you must regard it. We have been working on the Northern Latitudinal Railway project for a long time. It will help us ease the burden on the BAM and Trans-Siberian railways, which is a matter of fundamental importance in light of redirecting our basic exports to the east. Yesterday, I spoke with the Amur Region Governor where trains come and go every five minutes in some places. By the way, he asked us to help with viaduct construction. We must do this, no matter what, because it is necessary to create normal living conditions in these areas. Well, this is a different subject, and we will discuss it later. Today, I suggest that we discuss a number of other matters in detail. The development of the Northern Sea Route is the first topic. It is necessary to create a modern port and search-and-rescue infrastructure there. We also need to develop satellite-based monitoring systems and communications networks. This also includes the implementation of our ambitious plans, in the good sense of this term, to expand icebreaker and merchant marine fleets and to build Arctic-class gas carriers. I would like the Head of the Rosatom State Corporation to report on projects to build and design new icebreakers, as well as on the state measures that are essential in order to fully accomplish all the tasks that have been set here on time. The second topic is to do with equipment for Arctic ports and terminals, vessels, navigation systems, as well as equipment for regional enterprises. Today, I am looking forward to hearing proposals on import substitution and the localisation of the relevant equipment manufacturing facilities in Russia. The third area of importance is ecology and the environment. We closely link all Arctic programmes and projects with efforts to preserve biodiversity and Arctic ecosystems, as well as long-term work to address climate agenda tasks. Thus, we need to continue implementing projects to totally eliminate accumulated damage. This also concerns scientific research programmes, primarily those aiming to facilitate a stable balance between economic development and the conservation of Arctic nature. As you know, the local ecosystem is very fragile. Permafrost monitoring projects are the foundation for maintaining such stability. Melting permafrost layers can have an impact on Arctic ecosystems and infrastructure facilities, as well as those in adjacent territories. We have already issued an instruction to create and finance the relevant monitoring system. Today, I will ask you to report on its implementation. I would like to emphasise that scientific data and timely, well-grounded forecasts will allow us to make the best managerial decisions, including those on developing international cooperation in the Arctic. The Severny Polyus (North Pole) ice-resistant vessel is set to become a platform for international scientific cooperation. Working in the format of an operating drifting laboratory – and I think they plan to establish 16 laboratories there – it will provide for the broadest range of studies – from bottom deposits to the upper layers of the atmosphere. This vessel is in a league of its own, and the international scientific community is certainly interested in its launch and start of work. It is necessary to complete all tests without red tape and send this vessel on its first expedition in autumn as we planned. I would like to emphasise that Russia is open for cooperation with all interested partners under current and future programmes and projects in the Arctic. This is confirmed by the special economic terms in place here, as well as all sorts of preferences for Russian and foreign businesses. I believe in the current conditions we should get extra-regional states and associations more involved in cooperation in the Arctic – there will be enough work for everyone. We will offer cooperation to all those who, like Russia, are interested in the sustainable development of this unique region. We view the Arctic as a territory of dialogue, stability and constructive cooperation rather than a zone of geopolitical intrigue. Let us get down to business. I am giving the floor to Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the State Commission for Arctic Development Yury Trutnev. Mr Trutnev, please. Deputy Prime Minister – Presidential Envoy to the Far Eastern Federal District, Chairman of the State Commission for Arctic Development Yury Trutnev: Mr President, colleagues, Three years ago, in accordance with the President's decision, the Ministry for the Development of the Russian Far East was tasked with working on Arctic development. What has been done since then? First of all, a legislative framework was created to increase the investment appeal of the Russian Arctic. The Foundations of Russia's State Policy in the Arctic and the Strategy for Developing the Russian Arctic Zone and Ensuring National Security until 2035 were developed and adopted. Six federal laws and 40 regulatory acts were approved. Using the experience gained in the Far East, we developed the Arctic system of preferences differentiated by four types of economic activity. As a result, the growth of new projects in the Arctic zone is 20–25 percent higher than in the Far East. Today, more than 460 projects are being implemented in the Arctic with state support. Total contract investment exceeds 1.3 trillion rubles. As a result of their implementation, 30,000 jobs will be created. Most projects are implemented in sparsely populated areas and require support for building infrastructure. So, for the development of the Baimskaya ore zone, it is necessary to build a marine terminal and an automobile road. Providing the project with electricity will require the construction of a floating nuclear power plant. At the same time, the launch of this project will help double Chukotka's budget. Segezha West will be the first project to create a pulp and paper mill in 40 years. As part of the Arctic LNG 2 project, a unique centre of large-tonnage offshore facilities is being created. The development of the Syradasaisky coking coal deposit will ensure the transportation of up to seven million tonnes of coal along the Northern Sea Route by 2026. Mr President, I am here to report to you that the actions undertaken by unfriendly countries have led to difficulties in implementing ongoing projects and have increased the cost of borrowing. Please consider the proposals on subsidising interest rates for the above projects. The required financing for 2022 amounts to 5.9 billion rubles. Developing the Northern Sea Route is a systemically critical prerequisite for implementing the Arctic zone projects. The Northern Sea Route is instrumental in importing the necessary construction materials, transporting raw materials and finished products and, in fact, ties the Russian North together. Our strategic goal is to create a new global transport corridor based on the Northern Sea Route. Four companies, NOVATEK, Gazpromneft, Rosneft and Severnaya Zvezda will account for the bulk of cargo shipment along the Northern Sea Route until 2024. If these companies manage to fulfill their plans, the volume of cargo transported along the NSR will have exceeded 200 million tonnes by 2030. The heads of the companies are here and will report on the implementation of the project separately. Much needs to be done along the entire NSR in order to ensure safe and reliable cargo shipment if we want to increase cargo traffic. This work is underway. Four nuclear-powered icebreakers, including the peerless Leader icebreaker, are under construction at Russian shipyards. Six more icebreakers will be built by 2030. Four of them will be built with extra-budgetary funding. Starting from 2025, Rosatom will launch a regular transport line, which will increase international transit to 30 million tonnes by 2030. Regarding the expansion of port infrastructure, four terminals are being built on the Northern Sea Route with a total investment of over 300 billion rubles to 2030. Mr President, thank you for your decision regarding the Northern Latitudinal Railway which is crucial for the development of the Northern Sea Route. Upgrading the emergency rescue infrastructure and expanding the Emergencies Ministry operated maritime and aviation emergency rescue centre network is of paramount importance. Expanding the space group in order to create a stable communications, meteorology and ice radar system is a separate task. Mr President, you said that extending target dates was unacceptable, so please support the proposal to align the timeframe for making decisions on financing the construction of additional icebreakers and the satellite constellation infrastructure with the schedules that are required to see these investment projects to successful completion. The Arctic projects will add more than 30 trillion rubles to the GDP by 2035, and tax revenue will reach 13 trillion. The companies will match every ruble from the budget with 15 rubles of their own funds. Budget investments usually pay off in four years. Expanding domestic transport is critical. In conjunction with Rosatom, the Ministry for the Development of the Russian Far East and the Arctic will open a regular coastal service between St Petersburg and Vladivostok in August operated by a Sevmorput lighter carrier which will cut the cost of transporting the cargo needed for investment projects, and will also help ensure northern delivery. A few words about the northern shipments that provide residents of 25 northern Russian regions with food, essential supplies, medicines, and building materials. The volume of cargo shipping along the Northern Sea Route under northern delivery alone is over 3 million tonnes annually. Transport costs significantly impact the final price of essential supplies, medicines, and food, and thus, the standard of living of people in the Arctic. Since northern delivery is paid for with lending resources, a higher cost can trigger a spike in prices of food, medicines, and building materials. Mr President, if you decide to support us, we are ready to promptly put together proposals for subsidising the interest rate for northern shipping. There is still much to do in the North. Creating comfortable living conditions is among our priorities. A major project for modernising communal flat infrastructure and renovating the housing stock will be carried out in Norilsk. Norilsk Nickel will cover the bulk of spending in the amount of 120 billion rubles. Mr President, In accordance with your instructions for developing the Far East, funds are annually allocated to eliminate the backlog of social infrastructure projects. As part of this programme, over the last four years in the Far East we have built and repaired 1,500 social facilities, including schools, hospitals, kindergartens, and sports grounds. I consider it important to draft the same programme for developing the Russian Arctic zone. Since August 2021, the Far Eastern Hectare programme has also been implemented in the Arctic. Over the first six months, we have received almost 8,000 applications. The greatest demand is for hectares in the Murmansk Region and the Republic of Karelia. Under the Children of the Arctic project, 100 percent of the cost of recreation for children living in the Arctic zone will be covered by the federal budget. Nineteen indigenous peoples of the North live in the Russian Arctic zone. The preservation of their customs, traditions and way of life is one of the foundations of our state's policy. The state budget has necessary funds for this work. Another important area of work in the Arctic is the development of science and technology. For this purpose, two scientific and educational centres are being created in the Arctic zone: in the Arkhangelsk Region and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The construction of an ice-resistant mobile platform for oceanological, biological and environmental studies is nearing completion. A year-round Arctic research station, Snezhinka, using advanced technologies in the field of clean energy production and life support systems will be built in Yamal. Work has begun on environmental monitoring and addressing the damage that has accumulated over time. Mr President, colleagues, On March 1, 2021, Russia became the chair of the Arctic Council. More than 8,000 people representing 15 countries have already taken part in this work in such areas as economic development, investment, exploration of the Arctic Ocean shelf, and preservation of the traditional way of life, customs and languages of the indigenous peoples of the North. Sustainable development of the region and joint efforts to counter climate change are the main topic of Russia's chairmanship. No country in the world can do this work alone; but that is especially true without Russia, which accounts for 58 percent of the Arctic coast. I am sure that our neighbours in the Arctic region will realise their responsibility and resume joint work. Mr President, In conclusion, I would like to present the results we should achieve by 2030 by implementing the state programme for the socioeconomic development of the Arctic and the strategy for the development of the Arctic region and indicators of national projects. The number of projects implemented with state support will reach at least 1,300, actual private investments made total at least 730 billion roubles, and there are planned investments under contracts worth almost five trillion. At least 110,000 jobs will be created. The average salary in the Arctic zone will increase to 159,000 roubles. Mr President, thank you for your attention and constant support for our work to develop the Arctic and the Far East. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. <…> Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, I would like to summarise our discussion and outline the main objectives and instructions. First of all, I believe it is necessary to approve the masterplan for the development of the Northern Sea Route for the period until 2035, to ensure reliable and safe cargo shipment on this essential shipping artery, the Northern Sea Route. I would like the Government to plan for the following objectives. First, to clearly identify the Northern Sea Route cargo traffic for the long-term perspective by specifying investment projects, shipping companies' obligations in terms of volume – as this determines our infrastructure goals – as well as the size and composition of the icebreaker fleet. All of our colleagues have just been talking about this. It goes beyond icebreakers though. I agree with Rosatom management when they say that we should consider the types of vessels that will operate at the icebreakers' tails. These 132 vessels that I mentioned must also be considered now. Our fleet upgrade plan also depends on these factors and the volume of shipments. We need to clearly determine the deadlines and volumes of icebreaker and Arctic-class vessel supplies. We also need to consider the scope of associated hardware required for construction. Considering this, we need to plan modernisation and expansion of production capacities for our shipbuilding facilities. It is also necessary for us to take action with respect to maintenance, in line with the report of the Arkhangelsk Region Governor. Second, the master plan for the development of the Northern Sea Route must include the construction and maintenance of a rescue fleet and the Emergencies Ministry's comprehensive emergency and rescue centres. We have hardly spoken about this today but it is a very important task. I know that we mentioned a helicopter group and so on but it is not sufficient and it is a different matter. Above all, we need to consider such upgrades where essential and large-scale infrastructure and investment projects are involved. Third, it is necessary to identify the level and sources of funding for all the measures included in the masterplan. This funding must be very specific and broken down by year. Furthermore, as we have said, complete and timely maritime delivery of goods to the north is a task of special importance. I would like to ask you to draft a special federal law on northern delivery. It should reflect all aspects of the issue, starting from a list of goods and delivery methods to the planning, implementation and control of these measures. At the same time, it is necessary to upgrade the existing and establish new transport corridors involving the Northern Sea Route and adjacent waters. As for implementing investment projects in the Arctic, I would like you to make active use of state support mechanisms, including the so-called Project Finance Factory. I would also ask you to review the issue of extending the benefits enjoyed by the residents of the Russian Arctic to the projects of companies that are already operating there. Obviously, there are many issues here, but these measures will allow these companies to build up their capacities and expand production. I would like to ask you to study the issue of granting these benefits. In conclusion, I would like to tell you about the proposal related to the development of the housing and social infrastructure of the closed administrative territorial units (CATU) of the Arctic zone, notably, military settlements and bases where our military personnel live with their families and children. I would like to ask the Government and the Defence Minister to monitor this issue and to ensure, before 2024, comprehensive modernisation of the infrastructure, energy, housing and social facilities in the Murmansk Region's CATU – the Northern Fleet's main base. You should continue this work in all other Arctic areas. It is necessary to focus on creating new jobs in addition to building and upgrading kindergartens, schools, medical, cultural and entertainment facilities. This very important task directly affects the wellbeing of the families of our military personnel. Of course, in working on the draft instructions that we already have, you should pay attention to the proposals made during our current meeting which were not reflected in this document before. Many thanks to all of you."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68186,Meeting with Roscosmos General Director Dmitry Rogozin,2022-04-12T19:40:00Z,Blagoveshchensk,"Completing his trip to the Amur Region, Vladimir Putin met with General Director of the Roscosmos State Corporation for Space Activities.","President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Rogozin, we have been discussing the development of the industry all day. Let us continue. Roscosmos General Director Dmitry Rogozin Rogozin Dmitry: My pleasure, Mr President. If I may, I would like first to report on some points related to the sanctions: what we think about their influence on our industry; to what extent we are ready to accept them, and what the main results of our import substitution programmes are. In principle, we understood that these sanctions would be imposed in one way or another. It must be said that some time ago the United States adopted an act that was simply kept under moratorium. According to this act, starting January 1, 2023, any space vehicle with any US-made component or microchip cannot be launched into space on a Russian carrier rocket or from a Russian cosmodrome, even if our rocket takes off from another space port, notably in French Guyana. So, these were deferred sanctions, as it were. Moreover, a year ago the United States announced sanctions against some strictly civilian organisations. Take our leading flagship institute– the Central Engineering Research Institute(TsNIIMash) established by Sergei Korolev. It includes the Flight Control Centre. Paradoxically, this is Houston's counterpart in ensuring the safety of the International Space Station, but it too was subjected to sanctions. This was a year ago. Sanctions against the Progress Rocket Space Centre were introduced in a similar way. It is our leading producer of Soyuz-2 rockets that you saw today in the assembly and testing facility. Vladimir Putin: These are simply attempts to hold back our development. Dmitry Rogozin: Absolutely. There was no other logic. So, the new sanctions by the European Union and the Canadian Space Agency looked identical, carbon copies, and not even related to our military organisations, the ones that are part of Roscosmos and engage in creating intercontinental ballistic missile systems. The sanctions do not apply there, and these combat missile systems do not need visas, as you know. But for civil organisations these sanctions were identical. We decided– I reported on this to you– to respond to these sanctions primarily in two areas rather than sit on our hands. First, to stop the delivery of our rocket engines, maintenance of the RD-180 engine that launches the US Atlas V rocket, and the RD-181 engine that launches the first stage of the Antares rocket and the US cargo ship Cygnus. In addition, we have suspended OneWeb launches. After the British government became a shareholder and after the statements that the British government had made about Russia and the moves by their leaders, we turned to OneWeb with a proposal that the British government leave the ranks of the shareholders and, second, that they give us guarantees that this group would not be used to support the armed forces of Ukraine. Of course, we knew how things really were, but we wanted to obtain at least some guarantees from our customer, and we provided regular services with regard to commissioning multiple spacecraft. When this failed to materialise, I decided to take the rocket off the launch pad. On March 5, the launch from Baikonur was canceled, and we severed our relations with that company, which, I believe, will lead them to bankruptcy, because the Europeans and the British do not actually have booster rockets that can maintain the launch campaign. With regard to the sanctions and their impact on our industry, you saw the Vostochny Cosmodrome today. It is doing well despite the sanctions. We had only one weak spot, the so-called compressed gas cylinders, which we used to buy from South Korea. However, I am here to report that the Nizhny Novgorod Region, the governor and I are in communication, launched the production of these cylinders, so we have replaced the imports here in full. This is what concerns the spaceport. Everything else is just fine. Booster rockets. In 2019, we replaced the Ukrainian-made control system on the Soyuz-2 rocket, which was called Soyuz-FG. Since then, we have been using our carriers that do not have any imported parts. The control system, the engines, fuel tanks, oxidizer tanks and the entire hull are manufactured in the Russian Federation. Moreover, when creating the Soyuz-5 rocket at the Progress Rocket Centre in Samara, we purchased new welding machines and converted from argon-arc welding to friction welding. We located a company that manufactures this equipment in Russia. The company Sespel in Chuvashia presented high-quality equipment, which is already being installed in the Samara Rocket Centre's workshops. I reported to you about the engines already. We export them, so there is no question about dependence whatsoever. They are dependent on us, not the other way round. We have a problem that we are well aware of, we have had it since the sanctions for Crimea were imposed in 2014. It is about supplies of special-purpose radiation-resistant microelectronics, which are used in 95 percent of spacecraft. Mr President, we are on top of this. We have accomplished a lot lately. We created a holding company for space instrumentation engineering and design centres. We work on the so-called foundry principle where we order a ready-made microchip. Just before the sanctions, we bought the privately-owned Yaroslavl Radio Plant, and now we have a mass production company that supplies us with space instruments. We have resolved two issues, which I reported to you about in Sochi and in Moscow, the high-speed radio link and traveling wave tubes. Indeed, there are, unfortunately, delays and we agree with the criticism, but there will be no disruptions. We will spend some time reviewing circuit design solutions with the general designer and we will then own it, and it will stay in the country. So, Mr President, there is no reason to worry about the rocket and space industry. There are many challenges, but we do not have to deal with the problems that, unfortunately, our colleagues have. We will continue to work as we did before, and we will ensure all federal launches this year. We will continue to commission spacecraft next year as well. Just last week we completed the work that we committed to with regard to spacecraft for the Defence Ministry. So, I think we are up to the challenge. Vladimir Putin: Good. Let us talk about the industry. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68185,Working meeting with Amur Region Governor Vasily Orlov,2022-04-12T19:10:00Z,Blagoveshchensk,The President of Russia met with Amur Region Governor Vasily Orlov in Blagoveshchensk. Mr Orlov informed the President about the socio-economic situation in his region.,"Vasily Orlov reported to the President on the growth of investment and the GRP. He said that last year the industrial production index was 105 percent. In addition to the four large federal projects ‒ the BAM-2, the Vostochny Cosmodrome, Gazprom's gas-processing plant, and the Sibur petrochemical complex, the region is implementing another 58 investment projects worth a total of 432 billion rubles. The region leads the Far East in the number of projects with 403 projects worth a total of 25 billion rubles carried out in the public-private partnership format. Last year, the region signed another concession agreement for rebuilding Blagoveshchensk Airport. A modern terminal will be completed by 2024. The cost of the project is 8 billion rubles. Despite the floods, agriculture did very well last year. The gross yield on all crops was excellent. The region produced 1,175,000 tonnes of soya, its main crop. Next year, it plans to turn out 1,350,000 tonnes of soya. This is possible because of the agriculture support programme for farms. Federal funds are allocated via the Ministry of Agriculture, in part, for the purchase of equipment. Last year, 5.5 billion rubles worth of equipment was purchased. Another 270 units will be purchased this year. Ninety percent of equipment is of Russian make. In addition, agricultural producers that receive these subsidies were supposed to increase the share of high-reproduction seed, the amount of fertiliser used and to practice crop rotation. This definitely improved the crop yield. Last year, a new poultry farm and a dairy farm were put into operation. This year, the region plans to open another three dairy farms with 7,000 head. Replying to the President's question on flood forecasts, Mr Orlov explained how they are protecting the coastline, building a dam and determining vulnerable flood areas. Gas infrastructure development was also discussed at the meeting. The region endorsed a plan for a first stage, up to 2025, when 12 percent of households will be supplied with gas directly. The second stage provides for the use of LNG in a number of remote localities that do not have gas mains. Gazprom is building LNG capacity at its gas plant, and the Governor believes increased LNG availability will provide good impetus for using gas in transport. Mr Orlov told the President about the implementation of the 11 national projects. All indicators have been achieved with the exception of one in healthcare, notably, average life span. This is, of course, due to the coronavirus. Therefore, the region's doctors are now focusing on the treatment of their COVID patients, on their recovery. The region is spending more money on major repairs and on the construction of new medical facilities. In 2019, these funds amounted to 200 million rubles whereas the allocations for 2021 topped 2 billion rubles. The Governor addressed the President with a request regarding the Trans-Siberian Railway. In the Amur Region, the railway cuts several cities and other residential areas in half, for historical reasons. The Governor believes overpasses are needed in many locations because people sometimes sit for hours waiting at crossing barriers. Rail traffic is very heavy on the Trans-Siberian Railway, and intervals between trains is sometimes only seven minutes and will soon go down to four minutes. In this context, the Governor spoke about the region's proposal to build five overpasses through a concession agreement. The project will cost about 11 million rubles. It is possible to start building the first overpass before the end of this year. The Governor asked the President to instruct the Government to allocate 900 million rubles for a capital grant – co-financing of capital expenses. The President suggested presenting the relevant documents."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68182,Joint news conference with President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko,2022-04-12T16:10:00Z,Amur Region,"Following the talks, Vladimir Putin and President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko made statements for the press and answered media questions.","President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Lukashenko, friends, I consider it important and symbolic that the talks with the President of Belarus today, on Cosmonautics Day, took place here, at Vostochny Cosmodrome. Our nations are proud that the first manned flight to space, by Yury Gagarin, 61 years ago ushered in a new era of space exploration. President Lukashenko and I visited the Cosmodrome's key facilities on this memorable day– the command centre and the launching pad for the Angara launch vehicles. We talked to Cosmodrome employees and met with the pilot-cosmonauts who received Russia's high state decorations just recently, a few hours ago. Everything that we saw during our visit to Vostochny Cosmodrome, all the successes in space exploration over the past few years show that our country maintains its leadership in cosmonautics. It is obviously a leader in this area. Russia's space industry is dynamically developing with reliance on the powerful scientific and technical potential created over the past decades. Importantly, together with our Belarusian friends, we have managed to preserve and enhance our close cooperation in space research. Our countries are carrying out joint programmes and we will continue doing all we can to promote cooperation in this vital area. I would like to note that on April 1, on the eve of the Day of Unity between the peoples of Russia and Belarus, Mr Lukashenko, acting as the Chairman of the Union State Supreme State Council awarded prizes in science and technology to teams of Russian and Belarusian scientists for joint space developments. We agreed to continue encouraging this cooperation, in particular, to intensify the work on developing a space system for the remote sensing of the Earth. These are devices for electro-optical high-detail video surveillance, which will become a key element in the EAEU-developed integrated system for producing space and geo-information products. One more promising move is to involve Belarusian specialists in building space infrastructure on Russian territory, including this Cosmodrome. A law is about to be adopted to allow citizens and companies from Belarus to work on the territory of the Tsiolkovsky closed administrative-territorial formation of the Amur Region, where we are now. We also discussed an orbital mission with a Belarusian cosmonaut. This could take place as early as next year. Naturally, during the talks we reviewed in detail many other current bilateral issues. As closest allies, we are building relations on the immutable principles of mutual respect and support and traditions of friendship and neighbourliness which are upheld by our common history, spiritual and cultural values and close ties of kinship. Belarus is our leading trade and economic partner in the CIS and ranks fourth for us globally. In 2021, our trade grew by more than one third– as we have just discussed– reaching US$40 billion. I am convinced that in the current situation, when the Western countries have unleashed a complete sanctions war against Russia and Belarus, it is important to deepen our integration within the Union State, and we agree with Mr President on this issue. We will continue to oppose any attempt to impede the development of our countries or to isolate them artificially from the global economy. I believe this is pointless; Russia and Belarus have always been closely linked economically. As I said, we are tied in many ways, including industrial cooperation, and such attempts will never succeed against us. I am confident that we will become even stronger because we will develop our own competences and, importantly, we will not isolate ourselves. Our governments and relevant departments have organised work on import substitution and the uninterrupted functioning of financial and commodity markets. The Union State has the following priorities: to unify and harmonise trade regulations, remove administrative and technical barriers, and create equal opportunities for Russian and Belarusian citizens and companies. These are the goals of the 28 sectoral programmes endorsed by the Supreme State Council on November 4, 2021. The President of Belarus noted today that our countries have already carried out over 30 percent of what we had planned by the end of 2023. Thus, we determined approaches to the formation of a uniform monetary policy, currency regulations and integration of national payment systems with banking. We signed a contract on harmonising our customs legislation. We are working to launch an interstate centre on financial risk management. We are creating an integrated system for administering indirect taxes. We met halfway our Belarusian friends and granted them comfortable terms for servicing Russian loans. We hope this will help strengthen the entire financial sector of the Union State. In energy, we finalised a draft international contract to create an integrated electricity market. Russia keeps its lowest prices on oil and gas for domestic consumption in Belarus. Payments for them have been switched to Russian rubles. This makes it possible to minimise the negative influence of the external environment on the position of Belarusian citizens and industrial companies. The joint construction of a Belarusian nuclear power plant is nearing completion. Its second power unit will be put into operation by the end of this year. In transport, we launched an integrated product tracking system. We are gradually integrating databases of government monitoring bodies in transport supervision. We intend to accelerate the development of new transport routes in the south and the east to guarantee delivery of our products abroad. Of course, we discussed issues related to creating a common defence space and ensuring the security of the Union State. We analysed measures to defend our western borders, the course of military-technical cooperation and specified the plans for joint exercises. Mr Lukashenko was informed in detail about the progress of the special military operation in Donbass and Ukraine and the progress of talks. Taking this opportunity, I would like to express my gratitude to our Belarusian colleagues for the efficient organisation of several negotiating rounds on their territory. A direct dialogue with the Ukrainian side was possible largely due to President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko's personal efforts. We believe the Belarusian platform is quite suitable for further meetings. Overall, Mr Lukashenko and I have covered almost all areas of our interaction today. The President of Belarus has yet to visit Vladivostok. The President plans to see the cultural and educational centre that is being built with the participation of Belarusian specialists, as well as to become more familiar with the achievements of the Far Eastern Federal District in the socioeconomic and other spheres. Mr President, I am sure this part of your visit will be productive and will help expand and strengthen our interaction. Thank you for your attention. President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko Lukashenko AlexanderPresident of Belarus: Mr Putin, ladies and gentlemen, First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the President of Russia for the warm welcome on this land. This trip to this Far Eastern land is extremely important to us. This is a stunning and extraordinary land. Frankly, I have long wanted to come here. For me, it was a kind of a romantic adventure. The fact that we had a chance to see the implementation of a project such as Vostochny Cosmodrome on Cosmonautics Day made the general impression received by our entire delegation even stronger. This is a world-class project, as they often refer to it. No, it is above world level. No one else in the world has ever carried out such a project. Space exploration is our shared goal. During Soviet times, Belarusians made a significant contribution to the development of cosmonautics. In our times, with the help of fraternal Russia, we have managed not only to revive the old competencies, but also to develop many new ones. As a result, Belarus has joined the ranks of space powers. In fact, we have created a new branch of the economy, space economics, and we are proud of these successes. Most importantly, we see prospects for the future which include developing a system for remote sensing of the Earth– a decision concerning this programme was made today, satellite communications and many other exciting areas of cooperation in this sphere. The time has probably come to open the door to space for new Belarusian cosmonauts. I am grateful to the President for supporting this initiative and, moreover, for making a decision, in conjunction with the head of Roscosmos, to finance the training and the launching of our cosmonaut into space. Of course, as Mr President said, we also had an in-depth discussion on other current issues on the bilateral agenda, on political, diplomatic, economic and, of course, military and defence matters. There have never been such dangerous and complicated periods in the modern history of our relations with the West. I pointed this out when we discussed the issue that everyone is talking about today; I pointed this out to Mr President, and I said this for a reason, that if Russia had taken even a bit longer to start its military operation, a blow they believed to be crushing would have been delivered at the adjacent regions. We can clearly see today that this was more than possible. Therefore, those who say that it was the wrong move or that it was made in the wrong place and at the wrong time should weigh it against the potential consequences of what would have happened had this move been made a month or even two weeks later. There is nothing more to add. It is like the story in Bucha; we discussed that policy. There is a lot of commotion, but they just needed to adopt a new package of sanctions, as we know very well. We discussed their special operation today, the psychological operation carried out by the British. If you want to know the addresses, the secret meeting places, the licence plate numbers, the brands of vehicles they used in Bucha, and how they did it, the FSB of Russia can provide this information. If not, we can help. We exposed that ugly, disgusting position of the West together with our Russian friends, in full and from the beginning to the end. Back then, we decided that the cold war was over, that the page had been turned and we would live in a new, civilised and fair world based on mutual understanding and the rule of international law. This is what we thought, but the West thought differently. They did not destroy us back then, and so they have decided to do it now. We are in an extremely dangerous situation; it is a showdown, and it did not appear out of thin air. Washington and Brussels have been deliberately moving towards this for years. It is perfectly clear now that, regrettably, the clash could not be avoided. Moreover, as I said before, it was only a matter of time and place. I would like to stress again that if we had waited a little longer, the consequences would have been extremely severe. The governments of Belarus and Russia have prepared comprehensive packages of measures to overcome, among other things, the sanctions pressure, to support the economies, to expand cooperation and, most importantly, import substitution, to reconfigure supply chains and to switch to a new mechanism for foreign trade cooperation. As we are responding to current challenges today, we must already be looking to tomorrow, which is what is happening here, and putting in place a ground-breaking economic development strategy for building the Union State for the long term. They say the world will never be the same, which is true. For those who would very much like to return, as they say, to their comfort zone, we can say it straight: forget about it. The modern world is all about fierce struggle and civilisational clashes. Incidentally, the West has never had any illusions in this regard. By the way, there was once a major figure in Europe who, in the 1930s and 1940s, also tried to establish a new order. We are all well aware of how it all ended. So, I think it is time for Washington to return to the recent past when our fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers stood up to the enemy and eventually won. We will also win, as has happened many times in our common thousand-year history. Thank you. Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov: Thank you. We will ask the presidents to take four questions, two questions each from Belarusian and Russian journalists. As is customary, we will start with our guests. Question: Good afternoon! President Putin, to follow up on your remarks, this question is for you. You said it is symbolic that your meeting with President Lukashenko is taking place right here, at Vostochny Cosmodrome. Mr Lukashenko added that this project exceeds global standards. I will start my question with a comment. We found out that President Lukashenko is the only head of a foreign state to ever visit this place. We believe that an invitation to such a facility is quite symbolic for Belarus and Russia alike. But there is a stereotype we often hear, especially in Russia, pardon me for repeating it, that we are like""little brothers."" How appropriate is that in light of recent developments over the past several years? I do not know the answer, so I want to ask you personally. Tell me, please, how dear has Belarus become to you in light of recent years and events? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: I would emphasise the second word: not""little"" but""brothers."" We have always treated Belarus this way. And nothing has changed in the past few months. We had no doubt that if any country backed us, it was Belarusians, it was Belarus. It has always been like this throughout our centuries-long common history. We do not even particularly distinguish where Belarus ends and where Russia begins, where Russia is and Belarus is. Also, however strange it may sound today, I have always said that we are a triune nation: Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. There is no doubt at all that is happening in Ukraine is a tragedy. But the President rightly said that we were left without a choice. There was simply no choice. There was only a question of time– when it will start. This is all. As for Belarus, I have already expressed my position: Mr Lukashenko's presence here today is no accident. This shows once again a) the special character of our relations, and b) the pragmatism, including that of the President of Belarus. He repeatedly expressed willingness to take part in building such large high-tech facilities as a cosmodrome. But we had a law that banned foreign companies and individuals from participation in closed territorial formations. But we have changed this law. As you know, we are changing it now. The Duma has already passed it, now it will go to the Federation Council and I will certainly sign it. I would like to note one more aspect. Russia is interested in attracting specialists from Belarus, including rank-and-file builders, as well as specialists, engineers and researchers because, as I have already said, our programme of joint activities in space has several components. It is not limited to the participation of Belarusian builders in the work here, on this complex, but also implies the development of spacecraft and work on manned flights, which we will continue to move forward with. Belarus has preserved the necessary skills and competencies. We are now working on a craft, a satellite that we will jointly develop in research centres and design bureaux, but that will be assembled in Belarus. It is natural for us to continue advancing cooperation that dates back to Soviet times. We will do this on a new basis, of course. I would like to emphasise it again– the fact that we are doing this with Belarus, and even in closed territorial formations, is symbolic and demonstrates once again how close we are. Alexander Lukashenko: Excuse me, Mr President. Excuse me, Dmitry. Our journalist asked his question with the implication that we are""little brothers"" and we are somewhat different. This has never been the case! The President of Russia never called Belarusians or me a little brother. You know, this is my terminology. I keep saying, sometimes half-jokingly, sometimes as a joke, and sometimes in earnest,""So what? Little brothers!"" If someone said that to us, and President Putin initially felt ill at ease when I said that, I would say to him,""Why should you worry? A little brother means that the big brother can criticise him any time, but he will also help by all means."" Therefore, there was a lot of sense in that. It does not mean that if we are little brothers, we are clumsy. No way! During our face-to-face conversation today when we were one-on-one, the President listed all the competences the""little brother"" has, and he generally mentioned it now. It is a long list. Thanks to Russia, we are a space power today. But we would not be so technologically advanced if we had not taken the decision back then to develop space technologies. During the first meeting with workshop workers, the President said that space is an engine that drives entire sectors of the economy, high-tech sectors. We have had a good school since Soviet times; Russia did not leave us but helped us. We launched a couple of satellites which are still operating and have long paid for themselves. Next, the nuclear power plant. It means top-notch technologies. Together with our""big brother"" we have created these high technologies in Belarus by building a nuclear power plant. And the Russians,""big brothers,"" taught us to build such plants. The key for us is– give us a reactor, and we will build everything else ourselves. Next, BNBC[Belarussian National Biotechnological Corporation]. You see, the most advanced biotechnology processes, four plants in the world. We have set up this corporation in Belarus. Defence. It is crucial. The President spoke modestly about it, however, at our talks we focused on the defence of Belarus and Russia. You know that the""little"" and""big"" brothers set up a joint formation, a joint army in the west. We are being taken to task no less than Russia, you know,""aggressors, aggressors"" and the like, as if they did not know that we have a joint army. And once there is a joint army, it is not one part that fights while another stays at home and so on. I did not conceal that. On the second day of Russia's operation in Ukraine I openly talked about our role in that operation. Do you remember I said that we will never let anyone shoot a Russian in the back, and this was the essence of our operation, our participation in that operation. So, we see what is going on, we see the Americans pushing not only Ukraine but also our western neighbour Poland and the Baltics into a standoff with Belarus. So, in this situation the""big brother"" will help the""little brother"" if needed. That is what it means, and not that the big brother is everything and the little one is unable to do anything. The fourth area we created and take pride in is missile engineering. The President promised me back at our previous meeting– you know that we are making a more up-to-date missile within the bounds of international law– so he promised me to help in this matter so that we do not waste years designing controls for that missile. I can name many skills the""little brother"" has. One of them is construction. I told the President of Russia once– let us help in this case. Dmitry Rogozin came– he is present here, we discussed with him what we could do here. We can build both industrial facilities and social infrastructure. And the fact that the President has invited a president of another country– even if it is the""little brother""– to a top secret facility, and you came here with me, testifies to the high degree of trust on the part of the""big brother."" And so I am not especially worried about that. Big, little– we have found a common language. I forgot about all the sanctions while I was here. We will keep working in all the areas and no sanctions will bend us or keep us from our path. Try not to worry, take it from me. At least you have a brother, even if""little"". Dmitry Peskov: Over to Russian journalists. Rossiya Segodnya, please. Question: Good afternoon. My question concerns the economy. How are the unprecedented sanctions finally affecting the economic situation? What macroeconomic and microeconomic effects do you see and how is the banking sector coping? Perhaps some industries still require additional support? Is there a risk that some sectors may soon enter a challenging phase due to the sanctions? Also, how might these developments impact the economic aspects of the union integration? Vladimir Putin: We have already covered this issue multiple times. I can only reiterate what was said before. The blitzkrieg that our ill-wishers hoped to achieve was unsuccessful, of course. It is obvious. Our financial system and industrial sector are operating as normal. Of course, there are issues– otherwise the Central Bank would not have raised the key rate to 20 percent. But, as you know, the Central Bank has already decided to lower the key rate and, in general, this measure is commensurate with the current macroeconomic parameters. As it turns out, the Russian economy and its financial system are standing quite firmly on their feet. I believe that this trend towards maintaining the macroeconomic indicators and the smooth and paced competent operation of the economic sector will bring results in the days to come. Of course, we do see and understand the risks related to logistics and payments. It is obvious. It is also obvious that the Russian economy is stable and effective. I do not want to repeat myself. You can see for yourselves that the dollar exchange rate has returned to the level it was at before the operation, and so on. However, risks may increase in the medium to long term. Russia's opponents plan to intensify their efforts. On the other hand, it appears to me that common sense must also prioritise certain things. For example, we are facing obstacles with respect to logistics, port calls, vessel and aircraft insurance and other matters. We have just discussed this using the example of the mineral fertiliser industry. If our Western partners change nothing here, the volume of Russian and Belarusian mineral fertilisers will shrink in the world market. But our industry will find where to send all this, I assure you. Many countries that we have not classified as unfriendly are eager to get Russian and Belarusian fertilisers. There is no productive agriculture without them. And if agriculture is unable to deliver productively, there will not be enough food in the world, in the world market. Food prices have already been on the rise, even before the events we are talking about. And the increase is considerable. Prices of certain types of fertiliser are currently three times higher than before the crisis, and they continue to rise. Among other things, all of this is linked to Western countries' mistakes in the energy and gas sphere, because natural gas is the primary component in the production of many fertilisers. All of this constitutes chains that are hard to break today. We were not the ones to create these problems. But the situation will get even worse for our partners, among others, if on top of everything else they aggravate the financial, insurance and transport situation, including maritime freight carriage. After all, the dearth of food or exorbitant world prices will lead to famine in entire regions of the world, and this is inevitable. The next step is new waves of migration, including those heading to European countries. I think commonsense should prevail, after all is said and done. And this is my great hope. Otherwise, those who initiated these processes stand to lose the most. We are aware that we have to allocate additional resources to support certain sectors. We are also aware that the most correct decision in the emerging situation is to debureaucratise the economy and enable the growth of new production outlets based on newly created logistical chains. In this connection, I can say that I have much hope for the rise of small and medium-sized businesses, the initiative from below, and the emergence of new leaders in Russia. The economy will adjust to the new situation without fail. If you cannot charter one ship, you can charter another. If you cannot send something to one country, you can send it to a third country. If you cannot buy something here, you can buy it in a fourth country. This is inevitable. The world today is much more complex than it was during the Cold War, when there were just two blocs and everything was covered by the CoCom lists. The world is more complex today and, in this world, a single country will be unable to maintain total domination. What do we see now? We see the collapse of the unipolar world system that developed after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. This is the main point. The main thing is not the tragic events in Donbass and Ukraine; they are not the main thing. A lot is said about the United States being""ready to fight against Russia to the last Ukrainian."" This is being said there, and it is being said here, and it is true. It is the essence of the current events. The economy is certainly part of these events. Some countries are trying to preserve their domination, including in the economy, but they will not succeed. Just take a look at the trends in global economic development over the past decade, economic growth in terms of the purchasing power parity, look at the leaders and the pace of development, and everything will become clear. Therefore, those who are adopting unjustified restrictions should come to their senses in good time and make a calm, correct, balanced and safe decision. Alexander Lukashenko: I wholeheartedly support the opinion of the President of Russia that the era of the unipolar world is over. Simply put, a unipolar world is nonviable. The President has provided a more complex, philosophical explanation. Any system is more stable if based on more than one support. The more supports there are, the more stable the system. Would it be a bad thing if the global system and the planet rested on four supports: the United States, the European Union as a second support, Russia, China and, possibly, India? Would it be less stable than the current system that is based on a single destructive, self-destructive support– the United States? I believe that sums it up. As for the sanctions, I wholeheartedly agree that there is nothing good about them. They create additional problems and take up valuable time. Yes, we will create a new system, find new logistics routes and many other things, but this takes time, and we could have used this time to move forward, to accelerate our progress, instead of wasting our time trying to find alternative routes and to figure things out. Yes, indeed, the world is different today, and it will be impossible to crush anyone, including such a huge country as Russia, which is absolutely self-sufficient but once came to believe in globalism and opened up its markets to its partners. Well, they behaved accordingly. We are telling them,""All right, goodbye, we will get along on our own."" And we can do everything. Today, we devoted a lot of attention to co-production matters. We talked a lot about our common market. I told the President that, as they say, Belarus is not as huge as Russia, it is smaller, but good things come in small packages. This is not the most important matter. As the President often says, competencies come first. Look, we have arrived here. It turns out that a gigantic Russia is interested in developing spacecraft together with us. We have these competencies, and Russia will be using them. Take construction, the simplest aspect. In Soviet times, Belarus served as a school for construction workers. The best builders lived in Belarus. And where have they gone? Well, they are still there. If we obtain a contract here today at the suggestion of President Putin, there is nothing wrong with that. Four or five months ago, the President and I discussed the issue of more advanced high-tech production facilities, including the creation and manufacture of semiconductors. We found many enterprises in Russia and Belarus, and we are now consolidating them, including Integral and others. The President promised financial support, and we will also do our best. As I often say, we can provide Dmitry Rogozin with a different and slightly larger printed circuit board and control system. However, it will operate smoothly, the spacecraft will lift off and return. Spacecraft have returned in the past, and this will also be the case now. In due time, we will catch up with them and overtake them, no matter what, because we are determined to do so and because we are not hampering anyone's work. We are therefore steering towards co-production and a common market. Our survey shows that Belarus manufactures several thousand items. The President of Russia asked us to provide Russia with these items, in order to assess local demand for them. We did not refuse to provide even one item, and we delivered foodstuffs and petroleum derivatives, although Russia is an oil power, etc. This list included refrigerators, television sets, washing machines, detergents, and all the other products that we manufacture. Thank God, all this is now in high demand in Russia. As for funding, lending and other opportunities, Russia is a great help to us in these circumstances. You know that everything that we produce we can sell here, which means we are happy with payments in Russian rubles. We have finally started trading in rubles, including oil, gas and other commodities. We are fine with that. We have two major products. The President of Russia mentioned fertilisers. We have potassium, phosphorus and nitrogen fertilisers. We have all of them. Trust me, it is only a matter of time. When the world begins to starve, they will realise that without fertilisers, there is no harvest. Trust me, I know something about this. The Americans swaggered for a while but eventually, they too had to admit that Russian fertilisers must be allowed into the markets immediately. They opened a window– and yet, shipments are still blocked in ports. They will come to their senses tomorrow– or farmers will force them to. The public will soon take the matter into their own hands. The second major commodity is petroleum products. We also discussed this issue today and agreed that we will find a solution. In fact, we did. The governments of Belarus and Russia will act on the decisions of the two presidents. Vladimir Putin: I would like to add a couple of words here. Of course, we are interested in cooperating with hi-tech economies– everybody understands this obvious intention. But here is the problem: in the course of this cooperation, we became hooked on somebody else's technology and hi-tech products. We stopped improving our own competencies and our own engineering schools in certain industries. It turns out that within the system that was established and that continues to exist in the world economy, it is possible to take action and steps beyond publicly declared rules. The best example, which I have already mentioned many times, is our Irkut MC-21 aircraft. As soon as we moved forward with this hi-tech product– notably, without anybody's help– they immediately cut us off from composite materials, for no reason. Why? To make sure that our production process was frozen and the aircraft did not enter the market before Boeing. So much for rules. Yes, clearly challenges are inevitable. But there is a gaping window of opportunity. We will have to develop our own competencies and our own science. We will use this new base to move forward– also taking into account other countries' achievements. Nobody can close all the doors and all the windows. Question: Good evening. Mr Lukashenko, much was said about Belarusian construction workers, our cosmonaut, and a new satellite today. Leaving the cosmic sphere for more mundane topics, what issues in Belarusian-Russian relations still need special attention from the presidents? Alexander Lukashenko: You know, all areas of our activities that have been discussed for a long time without much to show for it are now the focus of our attention and analysis. There is not a single issue that could be raised by either president, or a respective government, that would go without attention. Indeed, not a single issue. Today, we discussed oil and gas, including pricing. Moreover, the President told me that Russia would support our oil refineries in the same way they are supported in the Russian Federation. The governments are working on this. I was surprised to find out that the President is absolutely abreast of the situation in our common market and the groups of goods that we are currently supplying to Russia, and that Russia is selling in the common market, including in Belarus, and specific types of goods, such as machine-building etc., right down to agriculture with specific knowledge about what and where to sow… So, we discussed these issues including the military, and it appears that whatever issue I raised(I raised more issues than he did) I received support, not just a positive reaction, but support. So, I cannot say we have any issues. There will always be challenges, but they can all be resolved, and we are working to overcome them. Dmitry Peskov: We will take the last question today from Kommersant, please go ahead. Question: Good afternoon. I have a question for the President of Russia. This is not a short question, but the situation is multipronged, so the question will be multipronged as well. Mr President, you said you updated the President of Belarus on the progress of the special operation. Could you please tell us what you think about the special operation as of today? In this regard, one more question. What do you think about the course of the talks between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations? Also, in connection with this, because everything is connected with it, I have a question about the developments in Bucha and Kramatorsk. After all, clearly, most of the world has rejected the logic of Russia's explanations for what happened there. Please, what is your logic there? Yesterday, the Chancellor of Austria said you lived in the logic of military operations, the logic of war. Hence, there is no place for talks. Please tell us about your real logic. Thank you. I have a short question for the President of Belarus. The President of Russia has instructed Dmitry Rogozin to send a Belarusian cosmonaut into space. Would you like to be the one? Thank you. Alexander Lukashenko: Yes, I would. I used to think""big brother"" could send me there and leave me there, but today I do not think that, so I would like to go into space. But I have a candidate in mind, and I will think about it. Vladimir Putin: The special military operation is proceeding as planned. Of course, I am closely monitoring the discussion in our society and abroad. We must not keep anything from the public or keep anything secret; we must provide objective information about this combat operation. First of all, I would like to express gratitude to begin my response by expressing my gratitude to the Russian soldiers and officers, the Russian service poersonnel for their heroic service to the Fatherland. This is exactly how they are acting. By fulfilling complicated and dangerous objectives in Donbass and Ukraine, our military personnel are protecting the interests of Russia and defending Russia. It is with good reason that the President of Belarus has said, and I said this even before the operation, that confrontation with the forces that have been nurtured by far-right nationalists and neo-Nazis in Ukraine was inevitable, and that it was only a matter of time. They were preparing and biding their time, and we, as I said back then, will not allow them to do this. This is the logic behind our actions. What is taking place in Ukraine, considering that Ukrainians are our fraternal people, something I want to stress even in these tragic circumstances, first of all, this Ukrainian nationalism originated back in the 19th century. We know that it was encouraged before World War I primarily by the Austrian General Staff. What for? The answer is the notorious logic: divide and conquer. Divide the Russian people and destroy them piecemeal. The same method was used during World War II. We know that the Polish pogroms and Jewish pogroms were not perpetrated by Germans but by the same Waffen SS Galicia, Banderites and the other pro-Nazi bastards. They exterminated peaceful civilians: Russians, Jews and Poles. This is a common fact. And today we can see in Ukrainian newsreels people with SS Galicia sleeve patches in the combat zone in Donbass. This means that we acted correctly and at the right time when we started this operation, or there would have been many more such people there. As for the course of the operation as such, I always hear questions on whether it could be done quicker. It could; it depends on the intensity of the military operations but, unfortunately, this could entail more losses in one way or another. Our job is to reach all our goals while minimizing these losses. And we will be acting smoothly and calmly, according to the initial plan of the General Headquarters. I have spoken about this many times. There is no need to repeat all this at the news conference. Actions in certain areas of Ukraine are only aimed at containing the enemy, strikes to destroy the military infrastructure and create conditions for more active operations on the territory of Donbass. Meanwhile, the goal of our entire operation, I will repeat what I said in the early hours of February 24, is to help the people living in Donbass who feel inseparably linked to Russia and who have been subjected to genocide for eight years. The only question is how… Alexander Lukashenko: Today, this is the occupation by Ukraine, as you said. Vladimir Putin: Yes, occupation by Ukraine as well. This is exactly what it is after their independence was recognised. This is how matters stand. The operation is going according to plan. Now regarding our logic, it is simple. After all, during preparations for World War I and during World War II, a certain segment of the Ukrainian people and Ukrainian society especially those linked with Western ideology, was against Russia. These attempts are also being made today, in our time. As for the people in military uniform with SS Division Galicia stripes– they are simply scum. But there are others who sympathise with them. They consider themselves nationalists rather than Nazis. However, they must also realise that the main goal of the West is not to help Ukraine. Ukraine is just a means to reaching goals that have nothing to do with the interests of the Ukrainian people. This is what the problem is, and what determines the logic of our actions in Donbass and in Ukraine as a whole. As for Bucha… Now, listen, I often talked to my colleagues from the Western countries, up until now, and when they say""Bucha"" to me, I ask them whether they have ever been to Raqqa? Did they see this Syrian city that was razed to the ground by US aviation? Indeed, the dead bodies have been lying in the ruins for months on end decomposing. Nobody cared about them before that, and no one even noticed, just as no one remembers hundreds of dead civilians in Afghanistan, when a hundred or more civilians were killed at a wedding in one air strike. Silence. This silence was not there when they staged provocations in Syria and manufactured the alleged use of chemical weapons by the Assad government. Then it turned out that it was a fake, just like the fake in Bucha. Mr President gave me some documents, which he mentioned in passing today, which were forwarded to the Russian Federal Security Service, about who did this and how– our colleagues have this information intercepted– what transport they used to get to that town and create the scene for staging this provocation and fake. With regard to the negotiations, look, we reached certain agreements in Istanbul, under which security guarantees for Ukraine– and the Ukrainian side is striving to obtain very strict security guarantees for itself– will not apply to Crimea, Sevastopol and Donbass. Then, as you know, we made certain efforts to create a proper environment for continuing the negotiating process. In return, we saw the provocation in Bucha and, most importantly, the Ukrainian side walked away from the Istanbul agreements. Now, security requirements have become a separate issue, and regulating our relations over Crimea, Sevastopol and Donbass will be taken out of the scope of these agreements. That is, they have returned to a dead-end for themselves and for all of us. I was told that the Ukrainian side made some changes again last night. I am not aware of what these changes are. But this kind of inconsistency regarding fundamental issues creates certain difficulties on the negotiating track if we want to reach final agreements that are acceptable to everyone. And until this happens, the military operation will continue until it is completed and the goals that were set at the beginning of this operation are fulfilled. As for the united West, this became obvious long ago. I believe the media can see it as well, but this is not a subject they are comfortable with. What is behind its consolidation? It is Europe's insulting and humiliating position with regard to its sovereign, that is, the United States. You may remember that the British press once referred to a former British prime minister– I will not name him here– as""the US President's poodle."" Isn't that insulting? However, it is a fact of life that nearly all of the European countries' leaders are in the same irritating position, but they cannot talk about it. It is unpleasant and shameful to talk about it. Today they have Russian aggression and a common enemy. It is a convenient pretext for closing ranks and serving US interests. They have aways served them, but today they can do it openly, taking decisions that benefit the United States, including in the economy, and explaining it by the need to repel an aggressor. This is what I think is happening now. But the public in these countries, especially when people face the problems created by this political line, yes, they succumb to the general rhetoric, the anti-Russia hysteria. But I assure you that time will put everything in its place. When people see growing fuel and food prices and an unprecedented inflation rate, this will certainly influence the domestic political process. They wanted very much for the developments to affect the internal political processes in the Russian Federation. But they always miscalculate, unable to understand that the Russian people always pull together in times of trouble. They will see this yet, and their own problems are inevitable. They want to create these problems for us, and they are doing it. Yes, it will be difficult for some sectors, but we will deal with these difficulties. Dmitry Peskov: This will be all. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Komsomolskaya Pravda has a question. Remark: A very short question, if I may. Vladimir Putin: Go ahead. Question: Since there are two presidents here, I have a question that may not be all that serious. About two months ago, President Lukashenko said in an injured voice that he had asked Vladimir Putin to promote him to colonel, because he was still a lieutenant colonel.""If Putin promotes me to colonel, I will promote him to general,"" he said. How much of this is a joke? Vladimir Putin: Mr Lukashenko does not need the head of a foreign state to promote him. He is a big boss himself. As you now, I do not have a general's rank, but I serve my people honestly. And besides, ranks are for military personnel. As for President Lukashenko, he is on the frontline, and so he needs general's stars more than I do. But then, this is something for him to decide. Alexander Lukashenko: It would be great if I were a colonel as well. The truth is that he did promise to promote me but has not acted on his word.(Laughter) Vladimir Putin: If I promised, then I will do it. Will this be all? Dmitry Peskov: Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Alexander Lukashenko: Thank you, everyone."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68181,Meeting with President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko,2022-04-12T15:20:00Z,Amur Region,Vladimir Putin held talks with President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko at Vostochny Cosmodrome.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Lukashenko, Thank you very much for coming here, to the Russian Far East, to a project that is still under construction but is already working, our new Vostochny Cosmodrome. You have seen the scale of the project. It is symbolic that we are meeting here on April 12, Cosmonautics Day, because very many things in the life of the former Soviet Union, in our lives and in the life of our generations, are associated with that day, April 12, 1961. It was a day of triumph for the Soviet Union, the day of the first man in space, the first manned flight. It is pleasant that we are talking about continuing our cooperation today, under new conditions, based on the achievements reached in the previous decades and the latest best practices. I am referring to the creation of a new satellite for high-resolution remote sensing of the Earth and our future joint project on plasma engine, which we can make use of; it is a highly promising area. Of course, there is also the construction of the cosmodrome– we need good construction professionals, with high competencies and good technologies. Thanks to your efforts, Belarus has not only preserved all these resources but is actively developing them, and we can use them to address our common goals, which will undoubtedly boost the development of our economies and high technologies in our countries. Of course, I would like to use this occasion, our meeting today, to talk about our continued cooperation in the spheres we have outlined for the further development of the Union State. There is still much to do. Despite the so-called external pressure, our economic relations are growing successfully. Our trade has reached nearly US$40 billion or more precisely US$38 billion, which is a very good indicator. Belarus is one of Russia's leading trade partners. Moreover, the current circumstances and external pressure offer us new opportunities to make use of all our potential capabilities to support each other and to provide unconditional support to our development, including in such high-tech spheres as space exploration. This is in addition to[our cooperation in] agriculture and industry. We have done a great deal over the past years to boost our cooperation. Essentially, we have opened up our market to Belarusian goods. I believe that it is a very good pillar of cooperation on both sides. I would also like to mention our cooperation in energy, including nuclear energy(we are completing a major project in Belarus) and hydrocarbons, that is, oil and gas. There are issues we need to consider and discuss, including industry, and not only the production of agricultural equipment but also many other branches, mechanical engineering, namely heavy machine building. I am delighted to see you. Welcome. To be continued."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68180,Conversation with Vostochny Cosmodrome employees,2022-04-12T12:30:00Z,Amur Region,Vladimir Putin and President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko met with Vostochny Cosmodrome employees.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: I would like to once again wish you a happy holiday. President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko Lukashenko AlexanderPresident of Belarus: I congratulate you on your decorations. Remark: Thank you very much. Vladimir Putin: As I already mentioned, we started this in the Soviet Union, and we worked together. The entire Soviet Union stood behind the first manned flight into space. We remember this well. I am pleased to note that these efforts have continued to this day. Indeed, the circumstances have changed, but we continue to cooperate. It is no coincidence that the President of Belarus is here with me today. We have been discussing for some time now ways to use our common capabilities and competencies and to combine them, starting with simple things like construction work, and all the way to the creation of spacecraft. I mentioned the advantages of Belarusian enterprises in my earlier remarks, and we are using them in full. We are confident that this will benefit our space industry. So, happy holiday once again, and I wish you continued success in your work. I think Vostochny Cosmodrome is one of the largest construction projects in Europe and the world, a major facility with bright development prospects. As far as super-heavy duty rockets are concerned, there is work to do until 2035. The scope of the work is formidable but everything is going as scheduled. Unfortunately, the pandemic has taken its toll, and we had to shift the schedule""to the right side of the chart"" a bit, but it has been updated overall, and the work will continue. I wish you all the best. Remark: Thank you very much. Dmitry Bolotov: Mr President, may I ask you a question? Bolotov Dmitry, Vostochny Space Centre. We are celebrating International Cosmonautics Day today in our country and around the world, too. What do you think about this holiday? Do you remember April 12, 1961? Vladimir Putin: Yes, I do. Oddly enough, but I do.(Addressing President Lukashenko.) Mr Lukashenko, do you remember April 12? I was a child. How old was I? I was 9 back then. Frankly, I did not fully understand what was happening, but I knew something great and unusual had happened. Strangers were hugging and kissing in the streets. It really looked like Victory Day too, because for me, as a 9 year-old, it was clear that something unusual had happened. I didn't know what outer space was, and what a manned flight into outer space for the first time in history meant, but it was absolutely clear that a grand event had taken place, and it had to do with our country's tremendous achievements. Even a 9 year-old could sense the pride in the country in the air. It was such an outstanding event that I kept everything that happened back then in my memory. Of course, it was broadcast on television. Even children were impressed, let alone the adults who jubilated in the truest sense of the word. The country celebrated, and one might say the entire world did too. I am confident we will have events of this kind in the future as well. Thank you. Nikolai Aistov: Nikolai Aistov, Russian Space Systems. This is not a question. You mentioned this issue today. I would like to say that all of us wholeheartedly support the operations of our army and we want the tasks and goals set for the special military operation to be achieved. This is all I wanted to say. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: You can bet on it.There is no doubt about that. The goals are absolutely clear; these are noble goals. I said this at the very beginning. I would like to point out that I indicated these goals in my first address to the people and the Armed Forces. The main goal is to help the people of Donbass, the people's republics of Donbass, which we have recognised. It was a forced decision because, regrettably, the Kiev authorities, pushed by the West, refused to implement the Minsk Agreements that were aimed at a peaceful solution to the problem of Donbass and the two people's republics. They openly refused to do this. The President[of Ukraine] said that he did not like a single clause of the agreement, and other[Ukrainian] officials said that the agreements could not be implemented because they would destroy the country. They publicly refused to honour them. We could no longer tolerate that genocide, which went on for eight years. This is the first point. Second, Ukraine was being turned into a bridgehead, regrettably for us, into an anti-Russia bridgehead. They started nurturing the germs of nationalism and neo-Nazism that appeared in that country long ago. You know that, if you took note of what I said in one of my public addresses, they specially nurtured that neo-Nazi virus, and Russia's clash with these forces was inevitable. They were just choosing the right time for an attack. The subsequent events have shown how much this has germinated. It is an obvious fact. Regrettably, neo-Nazism has become a fact of life in a big country with which we had close affinity. This is clear. It was imminent, and just a matter of time. What we are doing there is helping people, saving them from genocide, on the one hand, and at the same time we are taking measures to ensure the security of Russia itself– it is obvious that we had no alternative and that it was the right step. And there is no doubt that we will definitely attain the goals set. Anything else? Alexander Tarakanov: May I ask a question? Vladimir Putin: Go ahead. Alexander Tarakanov: Alexander Tarakanov, NPO Lavochkin. Mr President, can Russia continue working on its aerospace programme under the sanctions imposed by the unfriendly countries? What measures are being taken to strengthen our technological sovereignty in this sphere? Vladimir Putin: Mr Tarakanov, we were just talking about Yury Gagarin's first space flight. In 1961, the Soviet Union was in complete technological isolation, and the sanctions against it were overwhelming. Nevertheless, the Soviet Union became the first country to orbit an artificial earth satellite, the first man in space was a Soviet citizen, and the first space station was ours, and the first mission to the Moon was ours as well, if memory serves, the first spacewalk was made by our man, and the first woman in space was our Valentina Tereshkova, God bless her. We did all of that in conditions of complete technological isolation, and yet we made these incredible achievements. Can't today's Russia, with advanced technologies at its disposal, continue to work on its space programme, which we have outlined until 2030? Of course, we will do it. Moreover, this may sound strange because it seemingly concerns different spheres, but I have mentioned it many times: when the first sanctions were imposed in 2014, some of our industries, for example, agriculture, made huge strides. Our agriculture has become a high-tech sector. Our agricultural exports have even exceeded the export of our weapons systems by a large margin, by US$10 billion. Of course, modern science and technologies are interconnected, and we are not going to isolate ourselves. It is impossible to completely isolate anyone in the modern world, let alone a large country like Russia. Therefore, we will work with those of our partners who want to cooperate with us. We will work on near space and outer space programmes, and we will also implement our moon-exploration programme. As you know, we plan to implement the Luna 25 lander mission in the third quarter. Can we make it in the third quarter? General Director of the Roscosmos State Corporation for Space Activities Dmitry Rogozin Rogozin Dmitry: We must. The launch window will close in the third quarter. Vladimir Putin: Well, there you go. We will continue working. Even the Vostochny development plans are set out until 2035. We will continue to develop technologies and improve our competencies. What we could buy with petrodollars and gas profits before– well, the money will remain in the country anyway. We will use them to develop our own competencies. I know this will do us a lot of good. Alexander Tarakanov: Thank you. Vladimir Tokarev: Mr President, I have a question. Vladimir Putin: Yes, please. Vladimir Tokarev: Vostochny Cosmodrome Directorate, Vladimir Tokarev. Mr President, when should we expect construction workers from Belarus to arrive at the Vostochny Cosmodrome? Vladimir Putin: President Lukashenko is here. Vladimir Tokarev: Mr Lukashenko, we look forward to seeing you. Alexander Lukashenko: We will not keep you waiting. Vladimir Tokarev: Glad to hear that. Alexander Lukashenko: You know, President Putin speaks about""sanctions."" And I was saying to Dmitry Rogozin,""You know, here it feels like there are no sanctions."" Everything is your own. You make everything with your own hands. Why are we worried about these sanctions? Can't we build everything? Vladimir Tokarev: We will. Alexander Lukashenko: We will do everything. We just need a bit of time. This is why the President invited me here, so that I could see everything with my own eyes. Vladimir Putin: Yes, to see the amount of work, the scale. Belarusian builders have a very good reputation for being highly skilled. We will do everything. But as I have already said, this is not the only area of our space cooperation. They have a very good company. They will use our developments and be in charge of the final production. Dmitry Rogozin: Peleng. Vladimir Putin: Yes, Peleng, a very good company. It remained from the Soviet times and President Lukashenko did not allow it to crumble and supported it. We will use it and work actively in the future. These are quite specific things. We will make a high-tech vehicle. Builders will work here and we will develop space cooperation. Vladimir Tokarev: Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Thank you for this question. Alexander Aleshin: Mr President, may I? Progress Rocket and Space Centre, Alexander Aleshin. More and more new specialists are coming to our Vostochny Cosmodrome every year. Yet, I have to admit that life here is not what it is in a metropolitan area. What do you think should be done to attract specialists here, to the Vostochny Cosmodrome? Vladimir Putin: You said it yourself: to improve living conditions, to develop the city. I discussed this with Mr Rogozin. We believe it is necessary to build not only high-rise but also low-rise buildings, develop social infrastructure and develop cultural spaces. We have all of it in our plans and will do this simultaneously. You know, initially when I just devised this project, the cosmodrome, I spoke about the need to accelerate the development of social facilities so that people feel comfortable here. We have now looked at a runway for receiving aircraft but in addition to technological aviation we need passenger flights for people to come here. We will develop the project across the board. We will focus on tourism, including in the Far East. Incidentally, I asked the Government to double cashback for those who come to Far Eastern regions. It is also necessary to develop technological tourism here so that people could come and see everything here. Afterwards we will create conditions for bringing down the cost of travelling to the Far East, so that young specialists working here could freely travel to other parts of the country, primarily to its European part. Our cosmonauts know this, that is the kind of people they are, and you too– you work in this sector: of course, there is something special about these people, who are captivated by the idea of space exploration, and we need to create decent living conditions for them, including childcare centres and the like. All these things are included in our programme and we will deliver on it. I already spoke about it and I want to repeat: I believe this social infrastructure should be created at an accelerated pace. Mr Rogozin, do not forget it. Dmitry Rogozin: Yes, sir. Alexander Alyoshin: Thank you. Vladislav Zenkov: Mr President, allow me to ask one more question. Vladislav Zenkov, Vostochny Cosmodrome. We want the younger generation to know as much as possible about our country's achievements in developing space rocket technology. How will the government support efforts to promote science education and professions of the future, so to say? Vladimir Putin: This is a very important question. Once Daniil Granin told me that the government should give more consideration to this– science in general and also high-tech sectors like space. We will make films and write books on this theme on practically an assignment from the government and we will promote all these things at school. This is what we can and must take pride in and what brings young talented people to the sector. It is certainly a major sector. I believe Roscosmos is also considering this. Dmitry Rogozin: Today, we have more applications for enrollment than earlier, with seven applicants competing for a place at the colleges and universities that train students for us. It is a good indicator. Vladimir Putin: A large integrated facility is being created at the site of the Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Centre. The President of Belarus must see it. This will be our major rocket and space complex. Dmitry Rogozin: With 20,000 employees. Vladimir Putin: Twenty thousand people will work there. It is being designed for specialised research, as well as related sectors. It is very interesting, I would say captivating. We will work on all of these projects by all means, simply because without them it is impossible to develop an interesting and promising sector like cosmonautics. Then, you know what? You certainly do, as I have just spoken about it: space is becoming increasingly linked to various areas, from healthcare to, you know, the study of Earth and the mineral resources, as well as defence. So, if all this is skillfully presented to arouse interest in people, it will attract a huge number of talented young specialists to the sector, one hundred percent. No doubt about it."

Instructor and cosmonaut and test pilot Alexander Skvortsov and the Centre's lead specialist Oleg Skripochka were awarded the Order for Services to the Fatherland, III degree. President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko also attended the ceremony. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends, Mr Lukashenko. More than 60 years ago, on April 12, 1961, Soviet officer Yury Gagarin performed the first space flight in history. We are marking Cosmonautics Day to commemorate his feat and this landmark achievement. Each of us is experiencing special feelings today, including genuine pride for the generations that accomplished a grandiose technological breakthrough, and faith in the future, in our might and progressive development and confidence that we will certainly achieve all our goals. I am confident that this will be so. I warmly congratulate all our citizens, the citizens of Russia and the citizens of Belarus, all our compatriots, cosmonauts and the staff of Vostochny Cosmodrome, active and retired workers of the rocket and space sector. I would like to separately address and say a few warm words to service personnel of the Russian Aerospace Forces. Space, air force, space force are closely interlinked. We know that our officers are currently involved in the special military operation in Donbass, Ukraine, and that they are assisting the people's republics of Donbass. They are acting bravely, skilfully, effectively and with good results, as they use the most advanced types of weapons with unique and unprecedented specifications. The discoveries and inventions of humankind's greatest thinkers, our compatriots Tsiolkovsky, Korolev, Glushko, Chelomei and other outstanding Russian scientists and designers, the unparalleled work of teams from all over the Soviet Union, our engineers and workers are the main foundation of our achievements in addressing defensive tasks and developing civilian space technologies. They worked for the country in the full sense of the word, they fought for their Fatherland at plants, factories and design bureaux, and they won the toughest race for leadership in outer space. They developed the first artificial space satellite, the first manned spacecraft and the first space station, and they also launched automatic probes to study the Moon and Mars. It was a domestically built spacecraft that made the first ever landing on the incandescent surface of Venus. No other nation in the world has been able to develop such a technological solution to this day, or for that matter many other rocket and space technologies. The generation of national rocket and space programme creators has left us not only immense technological achievements but also values that we look up to, even today, and examples of comradeship, audacity – in the finest sense of the word – willpower and courage, which unite and inspire us to this day. Our ancestors' message to us is their urge to move forward, despite all challenges or outside attempts to hamper our advance. We will certainly implement – consistently and in a persistent manner – all the plans we have mapped out. We will continue developing a new-generation transport spacecraft and space nuclear energy technologies, where undoubtedly, we have made a very good headstart and possess absolutely obvious advantages. We will resume the moon-exploration programme: I am referring to the [planned] launch of an autonomous craft, the Luna 25 robotised space system, from Vostochny Cosmodrome. I would like to stress that we must successfully respond to space exploration challenges so as to be able to more effectively pursue national development goals here, on planet Earth, strengthen our security and technological sovereignty, and create advanced R&D in robotics, microelectronics, the environment, medicine, new energy, as well as navigation and communications. For example, it is necessary to tap the potential of space information technologies at a new level to ensure further introduction of digital services into all sectors of the economy, state administration, education, healthcare, and everyday life. For this purpose, we intend to expand considerably the quantitative and qualitative potential of Russia's satellite fleet under the Sfera programme. As for Earth remote sensing, we have started a major project to manufacture and launch specialised spacecraft. To do this, we have pooled the scientific and industrial potential of Russia and the leading Belarusian companies, which have been renowned since Soviet times for their skills in producing precision equipment and the most complex optoelectronic and radio engineering systems. Jointly creating an infrastructure that can guarantee the Union State independent access to space will be yet another important, signature dimension of our collaboration. Very soon, Belarusian workers and specialists, companies and enterprises, will be able to contribute to developing the city of Tsiolkovsky and Vostochny Cosmodrome. The State Duma has already approved legislative amendments to this effect, and once the Federation Council reviews them, which will also happen quite soon, I will immediately sign them into law. There is another decision I wanted to mention specifically. I am asking Roscosmos to arrange the necessary training and organise a flight of a Belarusian national into space on a Russian spacecraft. We discussed this with Mr Lukashenko a long time ago. I am certain that this will be yet another major milestone in our cooperation in space exploration. Friends, It would not be an exaggeration to say that being a cosmonaut is a heroic profession, since every spaceflight is always about accomplishing a feat, of being a pioneer, penetrating the unknown and reaching the limits of human capabilities, while performing the most challenging research and engineering tasks. Of course, people who demonstrate personal courage, strong spirit, boldness, a high level of competence and successfully deliver on a mission that matters so much for our country deserve the highest decorations. It is a pleasure for me to present these decorations to our cosmonauts, especially since we have been waiting for so long to hold this ceremony. Sergei Prokopyev is hereby awarded the Hero of the Russian Federation title and the honorary title Pilot-Cosmonaut of the Russian Federation. During his first space expedition, he carried out two spacewalks, including an extremely challenging inspection of the spacecraft's outer covering, writing a page into the history of world cosmonautics. As far as I know, there were no proper fastening devices. How this was done is of course a separate story. Alexander Skvortsov and Oleg Skripochka carried out three long orbital missions each. Through the honest and responsible service to their Motherland they made a substantial contribution to developing manned spaceflight programmes and Russia's role in them, enhanced our country's standing. For that, they receive the Order for Services to the Fatherland, III degree. Once again, I would like to offer you my greetings on this holiday, friends, and congratulate our cosmonauts on receiving these high decorations. Let us move on with the ceremony. Sergei Prokopyev: Mr President, colleagues, employees of Vostochny Cosmodrome, Thank you for the high praise not only of my work but also of the work done by hundreds of teams and thousands of people involved in manned space flights. I dedicate this decoration to my family, my wife, my friends and my mentors. I want to say that our people have always been proud of Soviet and Russian achievements in space exploration. Cosmonauts always seek to rise to the standard of our ancestors and predecessors. We want our people and our country to continue being proud of the Russian space industry. I want to thank the Cosmonaut Training Centre that employs unique specialists, the Mission Control Centre, the Centre for Operation of Space Ground-Based Infrastructure, all designers and engineers involved in creating space equipment, and all those who have always held the banner of Russian space exploration at the highest world level. In conclusion, I want to say that I am proud to spearhead the Russian Federation's programme of manned space flights and am ready to devote all my energy to this endeavour. Happy holiday to everyone! I serve Russia! Alexander Skvortsov: Good afternoon, friends, I also want to wish everyone a happy holiday and express gratitude for this assessment of our work. I fully support what Sergei Prokopyev has said. But I want to perform an honorary mission. Before a space mission, each crew is allowedto take along something precious and valuable for it. My crew took the Victory Banner. Today is Cosmonautics Day, and quite soon we will mark Victory Day. This banner was with us in space for six months, and we brought it back to Earth. We celebrated Victory Day with this banner, paying tribute to our great-grandfathers, grandfathers and fathers who fought against Nazi invaders and Nazism. There is a stamp on this banner, which confirms that it has really been in space at the International Space Station. There is also a photograph to this effect. Allow me to ask your permission, Mr President, to attend to the wish of my superiors, Roscosmos, the cosmonaut team, and all those involved in space activities, and ask you to hand this banner to the commander of the ongoing special military operation and wish all those participating in it at this moment that the word ""victory"" would be said as often as possible as they perform their missions. Let me take it with me now, Mr President, and I will hand it over after the awards ceremony. Thank you."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68145,Meeting with Head of the Republic of Daghestan Sergei Melikov,2022-04-06T13:50:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with Head of the Republic of Dagestan Sergei Melikov to discuss the socioeconomic situation in the region.,"Sergei Melikov said the situation in the Republic remained stable, and he started his report by assessing developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Daghestan has a positive vaccination rate, and over 90 percent of people in various districts, including high-mountain areas, have already been vaccinated. Information support and public outreach, primarily among senior citizens, are playing an important role. The Head of the Republic noted the role of the Muftiyat. Since the pandemic began, the muftis have worked hard to contain the disease, and they continue to help the authorities in this respect. The President noted that it is necessary to thank the muftis. Vladimir Putin noted that last year the Republic had posted 16-plus percent industrial growth or much more than the national average(3.1 percent). He inquired how Daghestan had accomplished this. Sergei Melikov noted that high indicators were not all that mattered. This is the result of tremendous work to rid many enterprises, including industrial enterprises, from the shadow economy's influence. Regarding agriculture, Daghestan's agro-industrial sector has always boasted impressive potential, and the authorities are doing everything possible to restore this potential, the regional head said. This includes issues related to viticulture and the wine-making sector, which receives support through recently approved regulatory acts. Daghestani wine-makers are not the only ones to obtain support; current grape production levels make it possible to supply grapes to Crimea, as well as the Stavropol and Krasnodar territories. Vladimir Putin noted that Daghestan was the southernmost republic, and that this explained its traditionally well-developed viticulture sector and substantial production volumes. According to Mr Melikov, it is possible to harvest more grapes, including table varieties, and to attain Soviet-era grape reproduction levels. Vladimir Putin reminded his colleague about the serious problem of water supply. The Head of the Republic said that it was a long-standing problem. Daghestan has not had a water supply scheme until now, and even with water resources, the region does not have the right approach to laying water pipelines and solving issues related to water supply, especially to large settlements, which are the first to suffer. There is also the problem of water disposal and treatment facilities. Many issues concern unfinished construction projects, which began under various state programmes but were not completed for different reasons, including those that require a serious assessment by law enforcement agencies. This assessment is being given, and these questions have been raised today. However, Sergei Melikov noted that, thanks to the President's support and the recommendations developed by the Government in line with the President's instructions, last summer the Republic applied for and secured an infrastructure loan worth 10.5 billion. Work has already begun on the main branch of the water pipeline; in the future it can be developed in large cities. This means it could cover the entire territory of Daghestan. Moreover, the Government support helps modify the previously developed and very expensive sewer project in the Republic's capital, Makhachkala. Vladimir Putin also noted employment, one of the most acute problems in the Caucasus, and in Daghestan in particular. He asked Mr Melikov which investment projects deserved the most attention and support in order to create new jobs. Sergei Melikov said that in 2021 the number of the unemployed dropped thrice. However, he admitted that it was not due to large investment programmes but to efforts to bring various enterprises operating in the shadow economy into the light. Plus, the social loan programme has also made it possible to employ many people. They received initial capital for developing as entrepreneurs, for developing their projects and programmes. However, the general issue of employment in Daghestan is still quite problematic, and the unemployment rate is high. The Republic counts on investment projects that work in Daghestan and, above all, on the development programme for Derbent. About 70 percent of the 170 billion rubles that should be invested in this programme is private investment. This includes not only housing construction, but also the utilities sector and the development of a tourism cluster in Southern Daghestan. Since Derbent is an attractive city not only for Daghestan, but for all of Russia(as the President noted, it is the oldest city in the country), the Republic expects that the programme will provide new jobs due to this interest in the city."

I see that all the participants are here. Today, we continue the series of meetings on key sectors of the economy to discuss measures designed to ensure the steady operation of our businesses and reliable domestic supplies both in the current situation and in the long term. At the top of the agenda today is food production and the processing industry. We will consider all the factors, including the area of cultivated land, land reclamation, and the availability of fertilisers, seeds, agricultural machinery and equipment for the food industry. In a word, we will discuss everything that influences the quantity and quality of goods on the shelves of Russian shops, and consequently, to a certain extent, the price of foods. As you know, the situation on the global food market has become noticeably more challenging over the past two years. I meant it when I said two years. The mistakes the developed countries have made in their economic, energy and food policies have led to a sharp rise in food prices around the world even two years ago. The situation has, if anything, worsened in recent weeks. With the minimal food supplies available in the world, new sanctions are being introduced; companies' operation and the logistics of supplying fertilisers from Russia and Belarus are blocked; and their own fertiliser production in the West is shrinking due to high natural gas prices, which is also the result of their actions – our Western partners' actions. Again, the situation on the energy market is deteriorating as a result of non-market, crude measures, including administrative pressure on our Gazprom in some European countries. We are witnessing yet another attempt by our partners to shift the blame for their own blunders in the economic and energy sectors onto Russia, and to resolve the ensuing problems again at our expense. Moreover, we are already hearing statements from officials about the possible nationalisation of some of our assets. Well, that can take us all any length. Please remember that this is a double-edged weapon. Back to the discussion at hand, I would say that in this situation, a shortage of fertilisers on the global market is inevitable. Not all countries will be able to purchase the amount of fertilisers they need for the current season, which means that crop yields will also decrease. At the same time, it is important to note that developed economies will try to redirect food flows to their advantage using the mechanism of money emission. But this will inevitably exacerbate food shortages in the poorest regions of the world, will spur new waves of migration, and generally will drive global food prices even higher. I repeat, this scenario is more than realistic, and we in Russia need to be prepared for it. This means being able to minimise the negative external effects on our citizens, to increase the manufacturing and supply of high-quality and affordable food on the domestic market, including fish products. This is a key objective for this year. At the same time, it is strategically important to reduce the Russian agriculture and fishing industry's dependence on imports, including the entire chain from the field to the counter. I would like to highlight such items as seeds and pedigree stock, vitamins, feed supplements and plant protection agents. Here, we need to clearly determine our import substitution benchmarks and pursue them assertively starting now. Considering the potential of the Russian agricultural industry, our science and industrial production, we have all the resources to succeed. Let me remind you that after the sanctions were imposed against Russia in 2014, our producers used that window of opportunity in the agricultural sector to enter available niches in the domestic market and gain a powerful impetus for streamlined and advanced development – naturally, with support from the state and the Government. Over the past seven years, Russia's agricultural production has grown by 15 percent and food – by more than 25 percent. Our market is fully self-sufficient when it comes to major food categories and domestic production. For some products such as sunflower oil and grain, Russian companies have more than enough capacity to satisfy demand, creating very good export potential. As of 2020, our country became a net exporter of agricultural products – that is, we sell more food and agricultural products abroad than we buy. It seemed almost impossible and incredible even 20 years ago. Today our exports go to about 160 countries. I want to stress that these results were also achievable during the pandemic despite the supply chains disruptions in the world. However, our farmers met this challenge with flying colours and even elevated their status. It goes without saying that this year, in view of the global food shortage, we will have to be more careful about food exports. We will have to closely monitor our exports to the countries that adhere to a hostile policy towards Russia. I would like to specifically note that, thanks to the expanded scope of production, we can ensure that food prices in Russia remain lower than on the global market. Food self-sufficiency is Russia's competitive advantage, and our citizens should feel its benefits. We must protect them from market fluctuations and price hikes on the global market. I want to stress this specifically for the Government: this work must be continuous, with a clear and visible outcome for people and businesses. In the same context, I want to remind you that we have a floating export duty rate on grain and sunflower oil. The fertiliser market is regulated to ensure the stable operation of agricultural producers. We took those decisions pre-emptively and it was the right thing to do. It is necessary to monitor the industry's supply of fuel and lubricants, seeds, and breeding stock. Naturally, companies should have an opportunity to receive the loans they need to perform their current tasks. In addition, under external restrictions, it is crucial for modern equipment and spare parts to be available. I would like to ask my colleagues from the Government to report today on how these problems are being resolved. I would also like representatives of the industry who are taking part in our meeting today to assess whether the measures taken are sufficient. I would like to emphasise again that the key task for the Government, regional governors and company directors is to preserve, support business activity in Russian agriculture. We should enable our agrarians, fisheries, and food producers in general to open up new companies, create new jobs and increase the production of groups of goods that we still have to buy in part abroad. Naturally, we do not grow bananas, and this is a separate item of our imports. I believe we should set ourselves a quite realistic, well-grounded objective: in the next few years, our agriculture, food production and supporting industrial branches should reach much higher growth rates. As you say yourselves, and I am bound to agree with you, they should exceed three percent a year. To achieve this, we will have to increase several times over the scale of reclamation, introduce new agricultural lands and intensify their use via nutrient application, large-scale mechanisation and modern IT. It so happens that IT is very much in demand in agriculture. Of course, it is necessary to make loans more affordable for upgrading production and the fishery fleet. We have been long dealing with it – quotas for vessels and so on – I will not go into detail now. Let us return to this next time. Today, I hope to hear specific initiatives on this issue. I would like to add that our absolute priority is the comprehensive development of agricultural lands and the construction of roads and other infrastructure, social facilities and modern housing. It is very important to let people who work in rural areas and feed the country to live in comfortable, modern conditions. I would like you to consider these priorities in today's discussion of the Government's proposals. I have already reviewed with several colleagues this morning what we will focus on in today's discussion. Let us get down to business. I am giving the floor to Mr Patrushev. Go ahead, please. <…> Vladimir Putin: Summing it up, I would like to point out that, given the imbalanced global food market and the unprecedented pressure on the Russian economy and our domestic companies, it is critically important to minimise the external negative effects for our people. This is our top priority. As a result of their own policies – I mentioned this in my opening remarks – a number of countries, including those in Europe, have already seen price hikes and food shortages, and the same is happening in the United States. There are other countries, this is already happening there. Our so-called partners will try to export these problems to Russia. We have all we need to prevent this from happening. On the contrary, we will increase the availability of food for our customers by increasing the capacity of Russian enterprises and improving food supplies to the domestic market and grocery stores. In addition to monitoring the situation at all times, it is necessary to use the entire arsenal of means and tools offered through state support for the agro-industrial complex (we covered various aspects of this), including the customs and tariff policy mechanisms, temporary restrictions on exports, and low import duties on certain foods. I agree with these proposals. Please document these proposals. Also, the low-cost loans that we talked about on several occasions today and reimbursing food processing costs. What specific decisions do I consider necessary to formulate or support, since the proposals have already been made? First, it is imperative to ensure stable operation of agricultural businesses this year. In this regard, I support the Government's proposal to allocate at least an additional 153 billion rubles from the federal budget (please think about how to make this work and report back to me, I am ready to support it) and, of course, direct these funds primarily to soft short-term and investment loans for the industry. Second, our systemic goal is to ensure a reliable supply of fertiliser to our agricultural producers. Here, the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the entire Government need to follow the situation very closely. Our farmers' needs should be the top priority. Nevertheless, I propose leaving the current contract-based arrangements in place. As far as I remember, they have three components: the regions, producers, and agricultural producers. We will not be switching to export licensing yet. Please keep this in mind. This does not mean that we have decided on it once and for all. No. We will give it more thought, but we will not be changing anything yet. Third. As I have said, it is important to reduce imports in the production of Russian agricultural produce. Seed production is one of the main areas here, as well as the development and introduction of Russian breeding solutions, including in cattle and poultry farming. This year, we will allocate at least an additional five billion rubles to support seed-growing and breeding centres. Fourth, it is necessary to significantly step up our own, Russian manufacture of agricultural machinery, food equipment and components, as well as fishing vessels. We have hardly spoken about this today, but it is a very important area. Moreover, this should be done without delay, at a fast, dynamic pace. We will discuss approaches to addressing this issue in the near future. I would like to ask the Government to systematise all proposals and provide the necessary funding for the relevant programmes. And the last thing. In 2020, the Agricultural and Fishing Development Strategy was adopted. It is clear that today enterprises in these sectors have faced new challenges that will stay with us for a long time. In this regard, I suggest reviewing the current Strategy, adjusting its targets and deadlines, and providing for a comprehensive set of state support measures and the necessary amount of budgetary funds, including for land reclamation and agricultural use, as well as for establishing new areas for exports of finished products. Development of the agriculture and food industry as modern, dynamic spheres of our economy with an annual growth rate faster than that of the overall economic growth must be the key objective of the adopted Strategy. I would like to ask the Government and the State Council to adjust the Strategy by July 1, 2022. And once again about fertilisers. I would like to say this once again: let us not make any changes today and agree with the proposal of the Ministry of Agriculture in general, but I suggest discussing this issue once again soon. Let me repeat, I would like to stress it: we do not want to harm anyone. Not ever. We should carefully deal with all this: logistics, insurers, everyone. There is a deficit today. It will be Bought up. It will be. Nobody wants to die of hunger. We must carefully look at all these problems and solve them, primarily based on our own interests. Thank you very much. All the best."

Advance payments for the procurement of electronic components have been increased to 100 percent; and contracts for the state defence order (SDO) can now be concluded with a single supplier at estimated prices not exceeding the SDO, without the need to register them with the Federal Antimonopoly Service. Despite the unprecedented sanctions that led to a reduction in the supply of materials and increasing costs, fulfilling the state defence order continues to be an absolute priority for the Russian defence industry, Yury Borisov added. Last year, at least 98 percent of its requirements were met, and this year, the progress towards some of the target indicators is already ahead of schedule. The Deputy Prime Minister also informed the President that the initial data for the next State Armaments Programme (SAP) has been prepared, while the programme itself will be drawn up by mid-2023 and will be submitted to the President for approval. The new SAP will focus on creating qualitatively new types of weapons, including non-conventional ones, such as directed-energy weapons, kinetic weapons, and artificial intelligence-enabled control systems and robotic systems. Yury Borisov added that the Government is now systematically working to accelerate the pace and volume of import substitution with appropriate support for crucial industries."

Today's agenda focuses on the situation in the aviation industry. We have long wanted to discuss these issues holistically, and today we will talk about it in more detail. However, I would like to begin with something we discussed last week. Today I signed an Executive Order establishing the rules for trading Russian natural gas with so-called unfriendly states. We have offered our counterparties from these countries a clear and transparent procedure. To purchase Russian natural gas, they will have to open ruble accounts with Russian banks to be used to pay for gas distribution starting tomorrow, on April 1 of this year. If no payment is made, we will consider this a default on the part of the purchaser – with all the ensuing consequences. No one sells us anything without payment, and we are not doing charity either. This means the current contracts will be suspended. I emphasise this again – in a situation where the Western countries' financial systems are being used as a weapon, when companies from these countries refuse to fulfill their contracts with Russian banks, enterprises, and individuals, when our dollar and euro assets are frozen, it makes no sense to use those countries' currencies. In fact, what has been happening? We supplied resources to our European customers – in this case, gas. They received it and paid in euros – which they later had frozen. Thus, we have reasons to believe that some of the gas supplied to Europe was essentially provided free of charge. Obviously, this cannot continue, especially considering that, should we continue to supply gas under the same process, euro or dollar payments could once again be blocked. This development is quite possible, especially given that some Western politicians have been talking about it publicly. Moreover, EU heads of governments have been suggesting similar approaches. This kind of risk is, of course, unacceptable to us. If we look at this issue from a general perspective, converting to gas payments in Russian rubles is an important step towards reinforcing our financial and economic sovereignty. It has been our long-term plan to consistently and gradually move in this direction, increasing the share of national currency transactions in foreign trade – that is, in our currency and the currency of our reliable partners. You may have already heard that many long-time energy suppliers in the world market are also talking about diversifying transaction currencies. To reiterate, Russia values its business reputation. We fulfill and we will continue to fulfill our obligations under all contracts, including our gas contracts. We will continue to supply gas as agreed and, I would like to stress, at the rates specified in the effective long-term contracts. I want to stress that these rates are several times lower than the current rates on the spot market. What does this mean? In simple terms, Russian gas means cheaper energy, heat and power in European homes, affordable fertilisers for European farmers and, consequently, cheaper food. Finally, it means higher competitiveness for European companies and higher wages for European citizens. However, judging by the statements made by some politicians, they are willing to disregard their citizens' interests so they can enjoy the good graces of their overseas master and overlord. This is the opposite of populism. People are urged to eat less, put on more clothes, and use less heating, give up on travel – presumably for the benefit of the people who are demanding this kind of voluntary deprivation as a sign of some abstract North Atlantic solidarity. This is not the first year that we have been observing such questionable approaches and actions in the economic, energy and food policy of the Western countries. Incidentally, the food crisis will inevitably be followed by another one, another wave of migration, primarily to the European countries. Regardless of this, the decisions that are being made, one after another, are pushing the global economy towards crisis. They are leading to the disruption of production and logistics chains, an increase in global inflation and the aggravation of inequality, to a decline in the living standards of millions of people, and to the tragedy of mass famine in the poorest countries, as I have just said. Naturally, the question arises: Who is responsible for this? Who will be held accountable for this? Obviously, the United States will again try to resolve its problems – just its own problems – at the expense of others. In part, it will trigger a new wave of emission and budget deficits. The deficit has soared enormously and inflation is setting records in both the leading European countries and in the United States. In the process, they are trying to blame us for their own economic mistakes; they are always looking for someone to blame. This is perfectly clear, we are aware of this. I would add that the United States will also try to make money on the current global instability, as it did during WWI and WWII, and its aggressions against Yugoslavia, Iraq and Syria, to name a few. Global markets are falling while the stock value of the companies from the US military-industrial complex is going up all the time. Money is flowing away to the United States, depriving the other regions of the world of development resources. Attempts to do everything possible to push Europe towards expensive American liquid natural gas fall into the same category. As a result, the Europeans are not only compelled to dip into their pockets but actually to undermine the competitiveness of European companies with their own hands, to remove them from the global market. For Europe, this means large-scale de-industrialisation and the loss of millions of jobs. Another consequence is a drastic reduction in living standards against the backdrop of price increases on food, petrol, electricity, housing and utilities. This is the price the ruling Western elite are telling people to pay, as I said, for their ambitions and short sighted actions – both in politics and the economy, including the economic war that they are trying to unleash, or in fact have already unleased against Russia. This did not start just now, nor in the past month. Illegal sanctions and restrictions have always been imposed on our country, for many years. The goal is to curb Russia's development, undermine our sovereignty, and weaken our industrial, financial and technological potential. I will repeat that all these sanctions have been prepared in advance and would have been imposed in any case. I would like to emphasise this point. In effect, these are sanctions against our right to freedom, to be independent, to be Russia. They are imposed because we do not want to dance to their tune and to sacrifice our national interests and traditional values. The ""collective West"" does not seem willing to abandon its policy of economic pressure on Russia. Moreover, it is certainly going to try to find more reasons for sanctions, or rather pretexts. One can hardly count on any change in their approach, at least in the near future. In this regard, I am asking the Government, the Bank of Russia, and the regional governments, to consider this while planning their systemic efforts to promote economic growth and support specific sectors, to keep in mind that the sanctions are not going anywhere, just like in previous decades. Such is the objective reality. What I would like to note here, and I want you to bring this to all your colleagues' attention, when reviewing each specific industry or sector, we need to focus not only on overcoming the challenges of this year, but also work out long-term development plans based on the internal capabilities of our economy, on Russia's science and education systems. We must primarily rely on private business initiatives and healthy competition, striving to maximise the employment of our industrial facilities, to develop new competencies and generally increase Russia's international competitiveness. At the same time, to make sure that the economic policy is effective, we need to look at key indicators like the preservation and creation of jobs, the reduction of poverty and inequality, the improvement of people's quality of life, and the availability of goods and services. We also focused on these indicators when we were discussing the situation in construction and housing last week. Today we will continue the series of industry-related meetings. As I have said, the aviation industry is on our agenda today, which plays a crucial role in the development of Russian industry, its high-tech areas. It is certainly of particular importance for transport services, which ensure the connectivity of the regions of our vast country. Allow me to remind you that Russian air carriers and aircraft manufacturers were among the first to feel the consequences of the improper decisions by the Western countries. A month ago, European and American companies unilaterally refused to meet their obligations under their contracts with aviation and service companies from Russia. In fact, they deceived their Russian partners by stopping the supply, leasing, maintenance and insurance of aircraft. In addition, the European countries closed their airspace to our planes. I will leave aside, for now, the impact of this decision on the foreign companies themselves, including damaged reputations and direct losses. I will merely note that Russian companies have fulfilled their agreements in full and were ready to continue doing so. However, the Western countries took these steps and we must certainly respond to them. I suggest proceeding from the premise that we will not be maintaining cooperation with our former partners in the near future. We will not close ourselves off from anyone; we will not be a closed country, but we have to proceed from the realities that are taking shape. We have every opportunity to see that Russian aviation not only overcomes the current difficulties but also receives a new impetus for development. First, we must support our airlines so they can maintain their sustainable and rhythmic operation, to keep jobs and make air service accessible to the Russian people. As I have said, these are operational, urgent measures. As for long-term plans, we must obviously adjust the strategy for the development of our aviation industry with reliance on our own resources and due account for the new conditions that bring a host of opportunities for Russian aircraft makers, design bureaus, and suppliers of materials, components and parts. The share of domestic aircraft should increase drastically during the current decade (and this is, of course, an opportunity for our aircraft equipment manufacturers). Naturally, it is necessary to achieve high quality, reliability and efficiency in the process. This is also important for Russian airlines, including private companies that should also develop as dynamic and profitable businesses. Of course, this matters a lot for passengers – they must be able to buy tickets at affordable prices – something we will talk more about later – while the level of safety, comfort and services must match the highest standards. I am referring now not only to interregional flights but also to the development of small aviation and services to difficult-to-access, remote areas. I would like to ask you today to speak in detail about solutions that will allow our industry to develop the production of a broad range of domestic aircraft. We are endlessly discussing this issue with you. It is also important to make sure that technical maintenance and aircraft repair meet the highest requirements. Let us start working. I will give the floor to Mr Savelyev. Go ahead, please. <…> Vladimir Putin: A few things I would like to say in conclusion. As I said at the start of our meeting, it is certainly necessary to support operations of the Russian air companies, but it is of fundamental importance not to do this at the expense of passengers, as our colleagues have just said. I fully share this view. This certainly should be kept in mind. It is necessary to make air tickets widely available to people and on this basis to expand the potential of air transport, rather than force people to incur additional costs. Let me outline a specific target: this year, the volume of domestic service should grow in comparison to what it was last year, and the passenger traffic, as of the yearend – we have just discussed this and I fully agree with this figure – should reach no less than 100 million people. Therefore, in addition to the state support measures already in effect, including the reduced-fare tickets for travel to the Russian Far East and other regions, I ask the Government to launch the large-scale programme we have just spoken about, a programme to compensate part of the air fare for domestic flights. I am referring to flights to be performed, as it was also mentioned, between April and October of this year, the most active flying period. The Minister of Transport has just described the specific parameters of this programme (I am aware of the debates on this matter), but, of course, I suggest that we primarily be guided by this. Nevertheless, the figure that is being mentioned – 65 billion [rubles], or 47 billion, or 113 billion, since there is no unity in the Government as to how to calculate these subsidies – let us, for starters, put the figure at 100 billion. If we have in view even ten percent of the reserves, the resultant figure will be exactly 110 billion. But we should also be mindful of the fact that this money comes in with a delay, as Mr Belousov said, and so we will be able to see, during the next four to six weeks, how this programme is implemented and, if necessary, allocate additional funds as needed. But I suggest that the calculations be based on the methodology proposed by the Ministry of Transport. The second point: many international and domestic flights for which people have bought tickets have been cancelled (we have just spoken about this). Yesterday and today, we discussed these matters with the colleagues. It is certainly necessary to reimburse these expenses. But if in previous periods, we issued certain certificates, today it is more difficult to implement this programme because many routes are closed and we will limit people's opportunities to use these certificates. Therefore, it is necessary to hand out the money – I accept this and I ask the Government to launch this mechanism shortly. Third, so far, we have temporarily restricted flights to certain airports in central and southern Russia. In this connection, I suggest reimbursing regional airports for their expenses throughout their forced downtime. This will make it possible to retain their personnel, and the airports will be able to resume normal operations as quickly as possible. We must also allocate funds for these purposes in full volume. As far as I understand, our colleagues did not voice disagreement on this matter. Fourth, lease and letter of credit payments remain a substantial financial burden for the air companies. Naturally, we have to reduce this burden. Speaking of letters of credit, I support the concept proposed by the Government and coordinated with the Bank of Russia. As for the lease payments, let me remind you that a substantial share of them was supposed to be made to companies from the so-called unfriendly countries, and they have violated their contractual obligations. In this connection, I ask the Government to draft a package of measures for resolving the issue of lease payments, naturally, taking into account the national residential status of any specific leasing company. Fifth, new air traffic trends considered, I ask the Government to approve, by June 1, 2022, a comprehensive programme for developing the air transport sector until 2030. It is important that the programme assess future freight and passenger traffic volumes, and that it specify the routes network. It is necessary to determine the number of the required aircraft and their types, as well as measures to expand maintenance and repairs, including components, tyres, etc., using this data. I would like to note that it is necessary to formalise the Russian industry's obligations regarding the delivery of aircraft and components to Russian airlines and delivery deadlines. It was for this reason that I asked a representative of our largest aircraft building company about it. This should be done in the near future, as soon as possible, rather than sometime in the foreseeable future. And, of course, this programme should prioritise air traffic safety. We must stipulate an exhaustive list of measures for this purpose. I would like to repeat that it is necessary to draft a comprehensive programme for transforming the air transport sector, together with the allocated budgetary funds, by June 2022. I ask our colleagues to strictly adhere to this deadline. I would like to thank those who prepared today's meeting. I ask you to heed our agreements and matters that transcended the framework of our current discussion in your work. If necessary, you should formulate these aspects in the form of separate instructions. Now something that is not directly linked with aviation industry or not linked at all – shipping services. I would like to ask the Minister of Transport to evaluate the situation with the use of Sovcomflot vessels by Russian consignors. They have their own freight and chartering problems. Sovcomflot also has trouble using these vessels. It is necessary to combine the capabilities and requirements of Russian consignors and carriers. I ask you to analyse this matter and to submit your proposals. Thank you very much, and I wish you all the best."

This Executive Order states, in part, that as of April 1, 2022, natural gas transactions executed after April 1, 2022, that include resident companies taking part in foreign economic activities that have exclusive rights to export natural gas shall be made in rubles under the foreign trade contracts with foreign entities if these natural gas supplies are sent to foreign states that commit unfriendly actions as regards the Russian Federation and Russian legal and physical entities. The same procedure applies to contracts for natural gas supplies signed with foreign entities and registered in the above foreign states. Under the Executive Order, Gazprombank, which is the authorised bank for the purposes of said Executive Order, shall open, based on an application by a foreign buyer, special K type ruble accounts and special K type currency accounts for natural gas transactions. The Executive Order establishes the rules for opening and using these accounts. Thus, under the Executive Order, a foreign buyer transfers the foreign currency specified in a contract on natural gas supplies to a special K type currency account. Based on the foreign buyer's instruction, the authorised bank sells the foreign currency transferred by the foreign buyer to this account at a trade session organised by the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange(MICEX)– RTS and credits the proceeds in rubles to the K type ruble account for the foreign buyer; it then transfers the proceeds, in rubles, to the ruble account opened by the Russian supplier in the authorised bank. The Government Commission on Monitoring Foreign Investment in the Russian Federation is authorised to issue permits allowing foreign buyers to meet their commitments on natural gas purchases without following the procedures established in this Executive Order. The Central Bank Board of Directors is authorised to determine the procedures for selling foreign currency, other than that in the current Executive Order, as well as to establish the procedure for K type special ruble accounts and K type special currency accounts. A number of related instructions were given to the Government of the Russian Federation, the Board of Directors of the Central Bank and the Federal Customs Service."

A retirement home has been built for war veterans that includes all necessary medical services. The Covid-19 pandemic has been contained with help from the Healthcare Ministry; teams of specialists arrived in the republic, organised seminars and trained medical personnel. Today, every hospital has its own team of specialists. The Ministry of Industry and Trade helped the republic to obtain essential equipment, lung ventilators, the relevant clothing and personal protective equipment. Although the construction sector is growing, there are infrastructure-related problems, including water distribution and disposal. The President pointed out another social problem, the lack of pre-school facilities and schools. Mahmoud-Ali Kalimatov cited the high birth rate in the republic and spoke of assistance from the Russian Federation's Ministry of Education. The President noted that it was necessary to keep the region's peculiarities in mind while addressing the republic's various issues."

Special consideration was given to humanitarian issues. The President of Russia informed his counterpart about the measures taken by Russian military personnel to provide emergency humanitarian aid and ensure the safe evacuation of civilians, including from Mariupol. It was emphasised that in order to resolve the difficult humanitarian situation in that city, Ukrainian nationalist militants must stop resisting and lay down their weapons. Issues related to the decision to switch to ruble payments for Russian natural gas deliveries, in particular to the EU countries, were also touched on. It was agreed to maintain contact."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68080,Meeting with General Director of the Presidential Grants Foundation Ilya Chukalin,2022-03-29T14:15:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",General Director of the Presidential Grants Foundation Ilya Chukalin reported on the status of state grant support for NGOs over five years.,"At the beginning of the meeting, the President recalled that the Presidential Grants Foundation started five years ago with 4 billion rubles whereas now it has a budget of 10 billion rubles. Vladimir Putin said it is particularly good that there are people who implement their ideas and plans in the social sphere. He emphasised that this was directly related to support for those that are waiting for help. This help arrives on time, and the funds received from the state are used efficiently. Ilya Chukalin said the main thing is that the non-profit sector of the national economy has received unprecedented impetus for development over the last five years. Unique conditions were created for self-realisation among people in the sector that socially oriented NGOs serve. The foundation received 110,000 initiatives and conducted an independent expert appraisal. As a result, 22,000 projects have received presidential grants for their implementation. These projects embrace many areas of social life. These 22,000 projects received a combined 45 billion rubles. The goal to work with the regions, set by the President, was carried out. In many regions, the number of foundation-supported initiatives increased more than ten-fold. Ilya Chukalin noted local history and support for the local historians that are engaged in this. He cited the expedition, ""Respect for the ships of the Great Victory"" by the Russian Geographical Society. With support from the Foundation, the expeditions have, over several years, found virtually all the ships and submarines that were destroyed or sunk in the Gulf of Finland during the Great Patriotic War. Mr Chukalin reported that in 2017 the Foundation was the first development institution to carry out digitalisation. The applications are received and processed and all the procedures like signing contracts, monitoring, reporting and summing up the results are done electronically. The Foundation has a system for managing projects, which includes monitoring implementation progress through key control points. Vladimir Putin noted that this was particularly important considering the large number of projects. As for summing up the results, Ilya Chukalin said that everything is subject to evaluation: the quality of implementing the projects, achieving the stated goals, and accessibility to information on support for a particular project, ways of getting support or taking part in providing assistance, that is, volunteering. Public and government agencies, experts and interested people can take part in this evaluation procedure. Every year the 100 best projects are selected for grants, so 300 projects were awarded over three years. On the President's instructions, those with the highest rating receive the status of performer of socially useful services following a simplified procedure, which gives them additional tax benefits and the opportunity to receive direct funding at the regional level to provide social services. Responding to the President's question, Ilya Chukalin told him about cooperation with the regions and co-financing of regional projects, noting that last year the Presidential Grants Foundation allocated 1.5 billion rubles that were used to support almost 4,000 projects. This year, the total was increased to 2 billion and will go to 78 regions."

The exchange of best practices between lawmakers from our countries helps to boost the effectiveness of legal regulation at the national level and create conditions for promoting integration processes. In recent years, the Interparliamentary Assembly has managed to do a great deal for developing mutually beneficial cooperation in the economic, social and humanitarian areas, as well as in overcoming the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, the Assembly continues making an important contribution to the task of mobilising collective efforts in the fight against terrorism, drug trafficking, transnational crime, and other threats and challenges to international security. The systemic involvement of Assembly representatives in monitoring CIS elections helps in full measure to implement the principles of fair representation and democratic, free voting. I am confident that today's anniversary plenary session will also be constructive and useful and will facilitate further intensification of joint work on the part of our parliamentarians."""

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68073,Meeting with President of the Russian Academy of Sciences Alexander Sergeyev,2022-03-28T13:40:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin had a meeting with President of the Russian Academy of Sciences Alexander Sergeyev.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Sergeyev, this year you will hold leadership elections, for President of the Academy. It is a good opportunity to talk about the Academy's performance, the projects it is working on, the outlook and what else the state should do to support our science, in particular, academic researchers. President of the Russian Academy of Sciences Alexander Sergeyev Sergeyev AlexanderPresident of the Russian Academy of Sciences: Thank you for this introduction. First of all, I would like to say a few words about the main achievements of Russian scientists, primarily within the framework of fundamental research projects. Next, I would like to say what we would like the state to do to further enhance the efficiency of the Russian Academy of Sciences. I have prepared a booklet, and I would like to begin with the most important achievements of Russian scientists. It is very important that in 2021 we launched the first Arktika satellite. In all, four such satellites are scheduled to be put into orbit under a federal space programme. But right now we only have enough funds for two of them. The second satellite is to be launched in 2023. The thing is that this satellite will be launched into an absolutely unique orbit, a so-called highly elliptical orbit. With four such satellites, we will be able to continuously monitor the Arctic, with good spatial and temporal resolution, acquiring images of the same area every 15 minutes. We will be able to acquire approximately 2 million images a year. This is very important. No other country has such satellites. Europe, the United States and Japan are planning to launch such a satellite no sooner than in 2028. It is a much-anticipated satellite, because to date we are mostly using information provided by foreign satellites. But now we have our own satellite of this type. We are already receiving the first images, which you can see here. It is a joint project of Roshydromet[Russia's national weather service], Roscosmos, and the Russian Academy of Sciences is, of course, actively involved as well. Vladimir Putin: Are you referring to the cloud chart? Alexander Sergeyev: Yes, the cloud and ice charts. Mr President, it is extremely important to install radio-frequency imaging equipment on our satellites, and the sooner the better. The trouble is that optics cannot see the underlying surface through a cloud layer. What we need is radio-frequency imaging equipment, centimetre- and millimetre-wave radars. We are working on this now, but the satellites do not have such equipment yet. We are working with Roscosmos and other organisations to create such equipment as soon as possible, so that we can conduct observations in any weather. This is very important. The next result of our R&D efforts is Tsiklodron, a newly designed unmanned aerial vehicle. It mimics the propulsion principle from old-time paddle steamers. With the latest automation solutions and by continuously monitoring the position of its blades and their angles, we can programme this four-rotor mechanism to perform any movements, including a vertical take-off, landing on a sloping surface, approaching a building, etc. This is the first time something of this nature has been developed. Of course, the famous Russian engineer Sverchkov suggested using this kind of propulsion mechanism more than a century ago, but this concept never materialised until now. So far, this device weighs about 60 kg and can carry only 10 kg. This is a demonstration unit. We made it at our facilities in Siberia. In fact, the Institute of Thermophysics of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences designed this drone, with support from the Russian Foundation for Advanced Research Projects. We believe that they formed quite an effective alliance. Here you can see wind-channel tests at the Chaplygin Siberian Scientific Research Institute of Aviation, and to the right the drone is actually flying. Vladimir Putin: It says here that the maiden flight is scheduled for 2023. Alexander Sergeyev: That refers to a six-passenger aircraft, while this demonstration unit took to the air last year. It stayed in the air for quite a while, for 10 minutes. This is how long it lasts on a battery charge. However, with a hybrid power unit it can fly for an hour. It currently uses propulsors that are one and a half metres in diameter. Efforts are underway to make a manned aircraft with a take-off weight of 2,000 kilograms. It is expected to be ready to fly in 2023. Vladimir Putin: What are the applications for it? Alexander Sergeyev: The Emergencies Ministry and the fire-fighters are interested in acquiring these aircraft. Unlike other quadcopters and helicopters, it can approach a vertical wall so that rescue workers can get out. We were surprised by the fact that it is much quieter than quadcopters, which enhances its appeal as an eco-friendly air mobility solution. Its enhanced manoeuvrability is very important. Having the computer steer all four rotors enables it to move along any trajectory at quite a good speed. The third result we achieved is a bit technical but very exciting nonetheless. We are familiar with the tar issue: fuel production creates a lot of heavy residue, with entire landfills filled with it. However, there are methods for using various catalyst agents in order to recycle tar and reuse it for making fuel. It is in this field that a very interesting idea surfaced. If we place tar, which is high in carbon and relatively low in hydrogen, into a reactor with, say, polyethylene or polypropylene waste, which are on the contrary rich in hydrogen, it produces amazing results, if we use the right catalyst agents. This way we can recycle up to 92 percent of this waste, while producing quality fuel. This offers an environmentally sustainable solution for both kinds of waste. Tatneft is about to launch a tar factory in Nizhnekamsk, and the next stage will be to set up a production facility for both tar and polypropylene. The Institute of Petrochemical Synthesis developed this solution. Vladimir Putin: There is a huge market for polypropylene. Alexander Sergeyev: Indeed. The next result is quite modern because, on the one hand, it concerns climate trends, the warming, while, on the other, the Russian Arctic. And this is also about fishing and the productivity of Russia's northern seas. Last year, we had an expedition on board a research ship, the Academik Keldysh. The Kara Sea ice cover disappeared earlier than usual, and the scientists actually went there in the second half of June. They saw much greater efficiency of photosynthesis on the sea surface, because the sun is high at that time. It's the polar day, and therefore solar radiation goes on practically all day. A great number of photons penetrate under water and set off photosynthesis. As we know, the process of photosynthesis is accompanied by carbon sequestration. It became clear that the seas in which ice melts away in late June or early July, specifically the Kara Sea, are two or three times as efficient at carbon sequestration. Meanwhile, carbon sequestration is the start of food chains that go further to ecosystems. This means that more fish can proliferate. Last year, crabbing actually started in the Kara Sea. Therefore, this is a very interesting trend, where seas are free from ice for longer periods and can capture and store carbon more actively, which means that more carbon is sequestered in food chains that raise the productivity of seas. Vladimir Putin: The ecosystem as a whole is likely to change there, and so there will be less sequestering. Alexander Sergeyev: You know, this is a very interesting question. I mean, where all of this eventually goes. After all, we must sequester carbon from the gaseous to solid state. It has emerged(you said so in one of your speeches, and we are glad because we have been saying this for a long time) that the sea surface sequesters no less carbon than, say, the vegetation on firm ground. Vladimir Putin: This is why we are suggesting that this factor should be taken into consideration, too. Alexander Sergeyev: This must be taken into consideration without fail. But it is still an open question where carbon eventually ends up in its solid state. This kind of research is in progress in the Far Eastern seas. Molluscs accumulate carbon in their shell, and this food chain leads to the situation where molluscs are grown and their protein is used for food, while their shells are what catches the carbon. Today, some countries are creating farms that grow molluscs with massive shells. This is one of the proposals as to how to enter climate projects via the sea. Mr President, I must tell you about the latest in the coronavirus research. Obviously, in 2020, scientists were focused on developing vaccines. In 2021, we achieved certain noteworthy results concerning the development of new medication platforms. I am talking specifically about platforms. Maybe drugs for which clinical trials have not yet been completed, but these are platforms. Why? Who knows what kind of virus we will get next time? We need to be ready to fight more than just a specific virus that we may know little about. We need a universal platform and we have developed one. It is unique. I want to briefly report on two more achievements, in the humanitarian field. A very interesting, I believe, result was achieved in Ulan-Ude. We have a collection of ancient oriental manuscripts in Ulan-Ude, at the Institute of Mongolian, Buddhist and Tibetan Studies. This foundation boasts 100,000 volumes. It is the world's largest depository of Tibetan manuscripts. They have not been deciphered. Our colleagues working with them say it takes decades for a professional to decipher one volume. They used 500 deciphered texts to teach a machine that uses AI and deep learning. Thanks to this machine learning technology, the machine learned to decipher with 94 percent accuracy. Now we are going to streamline this process by digitising the originals for machine-aided deciphering. Vladimir Putin: This will be a unique pool for world culture. Alexander Sergeyev: Yes. At the same institute, at the Centre of Oriental Manuscripts, we have around 7,000 ancient Mongolian manuscripts. If we polish this technology on these languages, we can use it to translate books in any ancient language. My colleagues say that now there is a chance to decipher these 100,000 manuscripts within one generation. Vladimir Putin: This could be absolutely remarkable. Alexander Sergeyev: Finally, the Institute of Archaeology of the Russian Academy of Sciences created a publicly available map of Russian archaeological sites, accessible on the institute's website. Anybody, including tourists and students, can see on the map what archaeological finds are located in Russia and where. Vladimir Putin: So they can learn more about our tangible and non-tangible cultural legacy. Alexander Sergeyev: Yes. It can serve as a foundation for studying tangible and non-tangible cultural legacy. Vladimir Putin: Excellent. Sounds interesting. <…>"

First of all, I would like to congratulate you and all your colleagues on Cultural Workers' Day. This holiday was established to honour an enormous cohort of people, true enthusiasts who dedicated their lives to Russian culture. Magnificent and inexhaustible, our culture reflects the entire diversity of the spiritual and historical legacy and traditions of our multiethnic country. It is one of the most essential foundations of the Russian state and society that strengthens our unity and develops a sense and understanding of the Motherland in our young citizens. Russia's cultural space was created by the hard work and talent of many generations of artists, authors and composers, actors and musicians. It is represented by a unique network of museums, libraries, cultural centres, concert venues and folk centres. In addition to the iconic Hermitage, the Bolshoi Theatre and the Mariinsky Theatre, there are thousands of local cultural facilities across Russia. Children's theatres and libraries are another entirely Russian achievement of cultural education, available all over the country. Russian culture has made an invaluable contribution to the development of world civilisation. For centuries, Russian masters of literature, music and fine arts have given humankind new aesthetic traditions and, more importantly, ideals and meanings that have become moral and spiritual guidelines for millions of people and entire generations. Russian culture is human-centric. The best classical works are focused on the inner life, personal quests and emotional experiences of human beings. They ask relevant questions, help people to think, understand and draw conclusions. It is not surprising that the Russian mentality is known for taking things to heart. We feel very strongly about other people's pain and injustice. We are capable of feeling sincere joy about others' success and helping those who truly need our help. Russian culture always protected Russia's national identity. While readily taking in all the best and constructive, it patently rejected anything false or momentary, anything that would disrupt the continuity of our spiritual values, moral principles, and historical memory. This unique quality reliably protects the Russian people even today, when seemingly eternal concepts and norms are being eroded and undermined in different countries, history is being distorted, and the laws of nature itself are being violated. In a number of countries– mainly the so-called Western countries– these processes have not just permeated politics, society, sports and education, but they often run the show in these areas, they are being aggressively imposed. Suffice it to mention the notion of cancel culture, which generally refers to public ostracism, boycotting, and sometimes withholding, even oblivion of certain obvious facts, books, names of historical and modern public figures, writers or anyone who does not fit into modern patterns, no matter how absurd they actually are. This did not begin yesterday. For example, as we are well aware, Hollywood has regularly released films that declared the United States the sole defeater of Nazism. Those films effectively""cancelled"" the courage and heroism, and the victory achieved by the Red Army, which made a decisive contribution– suffice it to consider the numbers of military units that fought on the Eastern Front, near Germany– that decisive contribution has been cancelled as well. When Japan annually commemorates the victims of the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August, they either bashfully keep silent about who dropped the bombs on their cities, or they write flagrant nonsense, that some abstract allies did it. This is what their textbooks say. They simply prefer not to talk about the fact that it was the United States that committed such as a terrible and unjustified massacre at the end of World War II. They have cynically decided to""cancel"" this truth as well. Children's writer J. K. Rowling, the author of books that have sold hundreds of millions of copies around the world, has recently been cancelled in much the same way for displeasing supporters of so-called gender freedoms. Today, they are trying to cancel an entire millennium-old country, our people. I am referring to the mounting discrimination against everything related to Russia, about the trend that is gaining momentum in a number of Western states– with the complete connivance and sometimes with encouragement from the ruling elite. This notorious cancel culture has turned into the cancellation of culture. The names Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich and Rachmaninoff are blacked out on concert posters. Russian writers and their books are banned. The last time a campaign like this happened, it was the Nazis who began destroying objectionable literature in Germany. We know well and remember from documentaries the burning of books right on public squares. It is impossible to imagine this in our country. We are insured against this largely owing to domestic culture. For us, this is inseparable from our Motherland, from Russia where there is no room for ethnic intolerance and where representatives of dozens of nationalities and ethnic groups have lived, worked and brought up children for centuries. Our society is proud of its cultural diversity– the strength and advantage of our state. I think many people know, have seen how a street artist painted Fyodor Dostoyevsky on a wall of a building. The West has now""cancelled"" or""is cancelling"" this Russian writer. This still gives us the hope that mutual sympathy and culture, which link and unite all of us, will pave the way for truth, that art and education will only promote wisdom, kindness and other time-tested values, as they should. I am confident that it will not be otherwise in Russia. One of the confirmations of this is the creativity of the participants in our meeting– the winners of prizes for young cultural figures and for works for children. Friends, you belong to different generations and serve in different areas of Russian culture and education. Yet, you are equally loyal to them. You are striving to multiply their rich traditions and bring up new generations of thinking and spiritually rich people who are able to perceive and pass on traditional values, who know and respect the past and present of their homeland, who are the true citizens of Russia. <…>"

Minister of Trade and Industry Denis Manturov, Minister of Healthcare Mikhail Murashko, Minister of Agriculture Dmitry Patrushev, Minister of Transport Vitaly Savelyev, Minister of Construction, Housing and Utilities Irek Fayzullin, Chairman of the Accounts Chamber Alexei Kudrin and Head of the Executive Committee of the Russian Popular Front Mikhail Kuznetsov were also invited to attend the meeting. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues, Today, we will discuss a number of urgent issues in great detail, and we will focus on the situation in the construction sector, considering its fundamental role in the economy and its significant social dimension. Before we do this, I would like to speak about a subject that I consider important. We have discussed this matter with our colleagues in previous days. As you know, a number of Western countries have made illegitimate decisions to freeze Russian assets in the past few weeks. And the ""collective West"" has virtually drawn a line under the reliability of its currencies. We have also discussed this aspect; and the West has compromised trust in these currencies. The United States of America and the EU have announced that they are, in principle, defaulting on their obligations with regard to Russia. Today, everyone in the world knows – they suspected it before, but now they know – that dollar and euro obligations may not be fulfilled. I have already provided a definition for such actions, and I am not going to go into detail. It is absolutely clear, though, that given the circumstances, it makes no sense for us to supply our goods to the European Union or the United States and be paid in dollars, euros or certain other currencies. So, I have decided to implement, in the shortest possible time, a package of measures to transfer payments, to begin with, for natural gas supplied to ""unfriendly countries"" to Russian rubles; that is, we will not accept any compromised currency to be used in these transactions. At the same time, on a separate note, I would like to note that Russia will continue to supply natural gas in the agreed to volumes and for the agreed-on prices as indicated in the existing contracts. Unlike some of our colleagues, we value our business reputation as a reliable partner and supplier. These changes will affect only the transaction currency, which will now be Russian rubles. I want the Government to direct Gazprom accordingly and to amend the existing contracts. At the same time, all our foreign consumers should be given an opportunity to make the necessary transactions, and a clear and transparent procedure for making payments should be created for them, including the purchase of Russian rubles on our domestic foreign exchange market. I want the Bank of Russia, in conjunction with the Government, to determine the procedure for such transactions within one week. I propose moving on to the agenda, and I turn it over to Mr Mishustin. Mr Mishustin, please go ahead. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin: Mr President, colleagues, During the previous Government meeting, which you held, I reported in detail on the measures that have already been taken as well as our plans. These proposals are being worked out in full contact with you, Mr President, on a daily basis. Now, I want to elaborate in more detail on the existing set of solutions to improve the sustainability of the economy. The operational headquarters is working almost around the clock and remains constantly in touch with the regions, as new measures are being discussed. In addition to the 20 already adopted federal laws, six more laws will be submitted to the State Duma soon. About 30 draft laws and additional proposals are in the works. To date, along with the measures already approved, about 200 initiatives have been selected, which are included in the priority action plan, and we expect that most of them will become operational by late March. One of our key tasks is to help those who now have to pay more in interest on previously issued loans or who took out loans with floating rates. The volume of this loan portfolio is estimated at about 11 trillion rubles. In an effort to support these companies, a special restructuring procedure has been proposed. Mr President, you and I discussed this in detail. In the months ahead, borrowers will not be required to pay the full amount of interest but can capitalise it instead and put it off towards the end of the year. At the same time, we will analyse the financial circumstances of these businesses and adopt additional decisions to support them. To do this, the Government will draw up a list of criteria for the borrowing companies that are eligible to have these interest payments written off in full. On a separate note, payments by individuals under mortgage loans issued before the key rate changes will remain as they were as of the end of February. The most important thing now is to support people. A resolution was signed on the maximum amount of a loan that will allow citizens to apply to banks for a grace period. They will be able to do this through late September, provided that their income is down 30 percent from the previous year's average. We paid special attention to the labour market. We will help those who want to find employment. Not only the unemployed, but also those who are at risk of being laid off can now use the employment centres' services. Many initiatives are designed to supply the domestic market with common goods. We have consulted with our colleagues in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) and decided to increase the limit on duty-free e-commerce to 1,000 euros throughout the entire territory. Consumer goods, primarily food and medications will have priority during customs procedures at checkpoints. One important area concerns the health of our people. Yesterday, we approved a proposal to support the sale of pharmaceuticals and medical goods by simplifying registration and purchase procedures, subsidising loan interest rates and further implementing the import substitution programme on critical medications and medical equipment. Earlier, we simplified procedures for the purchase of medical equipment, introduced a temporary ban on the export of foreign medical goods, and created more opportunities for medical organisations to buy equipment at the expense of the Federal Compulsory Medical Insurance Fund. This will allow hospitals and outpatient clinics to buy medical equipment for surgeries and laboratory research in any situation, while people will be able to buy the medications they need. Our airlines have faced major difficulties under the circumstances. Many airplanes with ""foreign registration"" instantly lost their airworthiness certificates without which they cannot be used. Parts supplies were discontinued and bans on insurance services were introduced. Foreign leasing companies are demanding that these aircraft be returned. Based on the law on registering the rights to foreign aircraft you signed, we received an opportunity to use them inside the country. The Government has helped carriers keep their fleets of foreign aircraft since the very first days. We are working to resume flights with these planes as soon as possible. Importantly, in taking these steps, we are strictly following the standards of aviation law, including the international regulations. Obviously, our main goal is to ensure flight safety. This is above everything else. We have transferred hundreds of aircraft – more than half the entire fleet – to the Russian Registry. To normalise the situation in this area, the Government took two resolutions. First, we made the registration procedure for listing Russian aircraft in the Russian State Registry as simple as possible and reduced the duration from 40 to five working days. Second, we adopted a document establishing a special mode for implementing aircraft leasing contracts with foreign companies. We have limited the return of these aircraft and aircraft engines to the owners. Russian carriers will be responsible for the technical maintenance and repairs in accordance with international standards. The restrictions have also affected sea vessels flying the Russian flag – they are prohibited from entering foreign ports. We will definitely not leave such unfriendly steps towards our country unanswered. The Government will introduce proportionate counter restrictions. The respective resolution has been signed. This is far from the whole list of measures that are currently being worked out. A large package of measures has been proposed for the construction industry. Last year, construction in Russia showed record results, and we are preparing new support options. They will help Russian builders keep the rollout of civil and industrial premises at the same high level. A third package of measures was considered yesterday. It includes shortening the investment and construction cycle and creating related infrastructure, as well as maintaining the procedure for changing the price of a state contract as the cost of resources increases. A number of steps have been taken to support import substitution. Yesterday, the meeting of the operational headquarters board considered the possibility of adjusting the special programme to stimulate the development of design specifications by Russian enterprises. A draft of the relevant resolution has already been submitted to the Government. A new online service, Import Substitution Exchange, has been launched. The platform should put together a broad supplier base and ensure the replacement of certain imported components with Russian ones, thereby creating demand for domestic products and speeding up the search for potential partners. This service will help develop supply chains and replace missing imported components. A draft Government decision has also been prepared to facilitate the provision of state support for research projects to create priority industrial products. The Special Investment Contract 1.0 format, revived in mid-March, has been adjusted, and a corresponding resolution has been signed. Such contracts can now be extended from 10 to 12 years, if restrictive measures by their foreign partners have affected the project's implementation. Also, the mandatory requirements for the export of industrial products and the diversification of supplies will be removed. Furthermore, we have supported contractors in public procurement – we have allowed them to write off their fines and penalties indefinitely if they violated their obligations under Government contracts due to the external sanctions. This week, a resolution was signed to expedite payments for products or services delivered under state corporation contracts with small and medium-sized businesses, reducing the time to seven business days, so businesses can receive payments as soon as possible. For smaller businesses, four programmes are now available to increase the availability of low-cost loans which include new investment loans for up to three years, an easy-term lending programme implemented as part of a targeted national project, and an increase in the maximum level of risk that the SME Corporation can assume for entrepreneurs under the so-called umbrella guarantee mechanism from the current 4.5 percent to 10 percent. Another solution is now available for small businesses in a number of industries which will apply to manufacturing enterprises, as well as institutions of culture, sport and public health, as well as the beauty industry and travel agencies. It is proposed that we extend their deadline by six months for paying taxes under the simplified system for the last year and the first quarter of 2022 followed by instalment payments during six months. This will allow businesses to postpone these payments until autumn and free up about 37 billion rubles. Mr President, under your instructions, ways to improve support for the regions was worked through in detail. To reduce the debt burden, a fundamental decision was made to delay the repayment of debt under budget loans to a later date; and, in order to create additional resources, to expand access to treasury loans to a total of 10 percent of their yield to generate additional resources (we discussed this during a meeting with the regions) for the implementation of ongoing projects. I would like to note separately that many of the activities under the plan were prepared jointly with the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, with whom we maintain communication at all times, day and night. The heads of the regions approached this work responsibly, and I want to thank them as well. Everyone is constantly in touch. Along with neutralizing the consequences of sanctions, the Government will continue to address the strategic issues that you, Mr President, have identified as part of the national development goals. The bulk of the anti-sanctions measures focus on reducing administrative burden, namely, inspections, which should have a positive effect on the operation conditions for entrepreneurs and improve the business environment in the regions. Our priority is to maximise the flexibility of the economy, to ensure uninterrupted operation of enterprises, and to keep employment intact. My colleagues will get into more details about other measures. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much, Mr Mishustin. Now I have a protocol event in my schedule. But before we take a short break, I would like to give the floor to our colleagues: Dmitry Patrushev, Denis Manturov and Mikhail Murashko, so that they briefly outline measures to ensure the availability of food, essential consumer goods, medicines and medical products. Let us begin with Mr Patrushev. As we stated at the end of last year, there is an increase in prices on the global food markets. This is due to a number of objective factors, but what is happening in Russia today also imposes additional stress on the market. It is clear that in such cases there is a rush demand. True, we can see that it has already died down, but nevertheless, we need to look at the big picture and consider all factors that are creating a certain situation in the market. (Minister of Agriculture Dmitry Patrushev reported that Russia fully satisfies domestic demand in basic foods. According to the Minister, the Russian agro-industrial complex will generally cope with any demand for food, including in case of a significant increase. He commented on the categories where there is peak demand and talked about measures that the Government was taking to promptly organise the production of the necessary items at Russian factories and solve the current supply chain problems, as well as about the progress of the spring sowing campaign and its financial support.) Vladimir Putin: I hope that you and your colleagues in the regions will carefully monitor any developments in retail trade and respond to them promptly. In this sense, we have a fairly high level of reliability. The main thing here is to monitor supply chain problems and to respond to them promptly. I apologise, but we will have a break for about 15 minutes, and after that I will ask, as I already said, Mr Manturov and Mr Murashko to report on their areas. Vladimir Putin: Mr Manturov, please. Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov: Thank you very much. In addition to supplying retailers with food, as I reported to you at the previous meeting, we are monitoring the availability and production of non-foods in our country. The demand for certain categories of goods was two to three times higher than usual in late February and the first ten days of March, but now it has noticeably declined. Sales of certain items are still 30–40 percent higher than in the same period last year, although demand is rapidly becoming saturated. Accordingly, warehouse stock levels of the most popular everyday goods are returning to standard level. For example, for personal care products, children's items and household cleaning products the stock levels vary between two weeks and three months. For all these commodity groups, both Russian companies and multinationals meet the needs of the domestic market. And global producers with facilities in Russia are not going to stop them and do not want to lose their share. (The Minister went on to give specific figures for children's sanitary and cosmetic products and other personal care products. According to him, 84 percent of detergents are produced in Russia. In the event that even a small fraction of imported goods are withdrawn, Russian and localised foreign companies are ready to increase their production volumes). We have not noticed any surge in demand for a wide range of clothing or footwear. At the same time, given the objective rise in prices and the suspension of sales of some imported brands, our own domestic clothing production is gaining a good advantage. Of course, our consumers are used to a variety of brands, especially foreign ones. The disappearance of some of them does not mean that the population will have problems buying clothes. There are currently more than a thousand Russian clothing, footwear and fashion accessories brands, and a favourable situation is emerging for them in terms of a more advantageous price-quality ratio. We are in no hurry to look for foreign replacements for certain foreign brands, especially since consumers have their own preferences. Now is the time for Russian production and brands to start growing, and for new clothing and footwear chains to start appearing. We will assist our companies in this work in every possible way. Regarding durable goods, we put together about 90 percent of household appliances and electronics, mostly of foreign make, with varying amounts of domestic content. Inventories of already-made goods will last from 1.5 to 3 months. The production of foreign components and logistics difficulties are certainly increasing costs, which is reflected at the retail end for consumers. However, producers have reserves of spare parts for several months, which makes it possible to alleviate these increases to some extent. The companies that assemble their products on Russian territory do not plan to leave the Russian market, especially since many of them have research centres here. This confirms again that they will stay in our market. As for the import of household appliances, our main suppliers are friendly countries that have no stake in suspending their exports. Our furniture industry is fairly independent with the exception of probably a small amount of premium goods. Over 70 percent of furniture in the domestic market is made at home. In effect, we have always emphasised building up mass production of furniture. The same applies to finishing building materials. In this segment, the share of imports does not exceed 4 percent. These include mostly tiles, bathroom ceramic and dry building mixes; but even for these items, domestic producers and localised companies amount to over 80 percent of sales. According to our information, nobody plans to quit our building materials market. Moreover, it is now being evaluated by new foreign investors that have the technology, raw materials and equipment. In general, I can say that statements by some brands on the suspension of their activities have not yet exerted serious influence on the non-food market. Only very few companies have announced a final decision to leave the market. Others are reducing advertising and pointing to supply problems but continue paying wages and the lease for their facilities. All of them understand that at the current level of competition it is very easy to give up on the market but much more difficult to come back to it later. We continuously monitor the activities of the main companies here, primarily foreign companies, which sell non-food products in our market and will continue to do so. Thank you for your attention. Vladimir Putin: Even partial departure of a foreign producer will certainly create a unique opportunity for developing domestic production. This is clear. That said, we need to do everything we can to maintain domestic competition, to prevent any monopolisation. This is absolutely clear. Of course, I would like to ask you to make sure that the range of goods in the market is broad enough for people to choose what they want. Mr Murashko, please brief us on medical products and medications. Minister of Healthcare Mikhail Murashko: Mr President, If I may, I will briefly cover regulations and trade in medical products. Prior to the pandemic, we created a fairly well-developed regulatory system. By ""developed"" I do not mean bureaucratic mechanisms, but clear and easy-to-follow rules for trade, for both manufacturers and businesses, as well as a high level of digital technology and government systems. Today, we can see every labelled pharmaceutical package, and we know exactly how many of them are in circulation which makes it possible for us to estimate and forecast the demand for medications. We know the exact number and types of medical products that are registered in the Russian Federation and are purchased by medical institutions and companies under tendering procedures. These mechanisms and tools made it possible for us to respond in a timely manner to the challenges of COVID-19, when with closed borders and simultaneous global demand for medical products, we teamed up with the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the regions to provide customers and public healthcare organisations with medical products. In order to ensure uninterrupted access to medical products for the public, we have identified six priority areas. First, to stabilise the situation, we need a monitoring system. It involves the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the Finance Ministry, the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service and the digital technologies we are using today. We are quickly developing and approving new mechanisms to address the issues faced by manufacturers or distributors. (As an example, the Minister cited the temporary unavailability of several medications in pharmacies, the sales of which, in early March, increased greatly due to the fact that people were buying them up and hoarding, which caused delays in the supply chains. Addressing the public, Mikhail Murashko said that manufacturers and distributors have no problems with production or stock. Currently, the public healthcare system has ample supplies of these medicines, and there is no need to stock up on them.) Yesterday, we gathered together major federal suppliers, and they told us that consumption rates are back to March 2021 levels. Production and deliveries continue as planned. Preventing auction-related risks during this period is the second most important area of focus for us. The Government has amended the law to simplify the procedure for purchasing medical goods and expendable materials, as Mr Mishustin mentioned in his remarks. As per your instructions, Mr President, we have established the Federal Centre for Planning and Organising Provision of Medicines for Citizens for centralised purchases of medicines under the state programme ""14 cost-intensive nosologies"" – it covers the provision of medicines for people with Hepatitis and HIV. In particular, we are purchasing large amounts of medicines for the Circle of Kindness Foundation. Purchases will fully cover our needs; as of now, 85 percent of medicines have been delivered. We do not envisage any risk for chronic patients from these groups. This system has been used for many years for the timely supply of medicines to each patient. I would like to note that by increasing the volume of contracted batches and by signing long-term contracts, we are saving budgetary funds and reducing logistics and storage costs. We are already making plans for 2023 to ensure guaranteed contracts for producers and for the timely delivery of medicines to patients. The fourth priority area is using these mechanisms for the distribution of medical products. We are working with the Ministry of Industry and Trade, with a focus on domestic producers. With this in view, we have prepared priority lists of medical products to be created and produced and have sent them to the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Russian Academy of Sciences. Russia has the necessary competencies for many of them. Our next priority is to remove the obstacles to the delivery of effective quality medical products to the Russian market. This involves the special registration procedures needed to validate a products' effectiveness and safety. Therefore, to be able to launch a direct dialogue and to create clear and understandable procedures, we have amended the medical products file. This will facilitate the work of producers and will reduce the period of consideration. We are also creating a hotline on medicines at an expert facility. We are holding consultations on the registration of medical products. This is a complex area, which is why we need such consultations. And the sixth and final priority concerns the highly sensitive issue of medicine price control. This is being done within the framework of state regulation of prices of vital and essential medicines. These prices are fixed and can only be changed for objective reasons to ensure affordability for users, including at pharmacies. In conclusion, I would like to point out that the measures we have adopted, and are still considering at the interdepartmental level, have a cumulative effect and are aimed at ensuring physical availability and price affordability, as well as diversity of medical products. Thank you. This concludes my report. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. I would like to repeat what I said after Mr Manturov's report. The departure or potential departure of some foreign producers from our market creates unique opportunities for domestic companies. This is how it was with the development of our agro-industrial sector when we restricted the activities of some foreign producers of agricultural products and the processing industry in our market. Obviously, at this point we must support our producers. At the beginning of our meeting, the Prime Minister talked about a number of measures that the Government is taking to make this support tangible. I know the Government is working on other measures as well. It is necessary to continue working on this together, in cooperation both with the Bank of Russia and the Executive Office. These efforts are bound to produce the desired effect, like they did in the agro-industrial sector. But of course, we must ensure quality and variety and enhance rather than hurt the competitive environment in the market. I am hoping this is how it will be, and I do not have any doubts about this. Let's turn to the next item, which is the main issue. Today we will review the implementation of our programmes on developing infrastructure, building capital facilities, including schools and hospitals. We will discuss separately the mechanisms for supporting housing construction, one of the main sectors in our national economy. Let me recall that at a recent meeting with the regions held on March 16, we made several important decisions on this. Let's discuss how they are proceeding. What are these about? Some issues were already mentioned, but I will repeat them. First, we decided that public capital investment would be funded as a priority. Supplies of materials and the implementation of projects must be funded in full as planned. As for the implementation of projects as such, this needs to be more flexible and open to different technological solutions and the use of components within a given range. At this point, I would like to point out that many of the projects already initiated in the regions have faced an objective increase in estimated costs. By the way, this was also the case in the previous period, but now it is even more obvious. To avoid disrupting construction schedules and to compensate for price increases on construction materials, we agreed last December, well before the current events, to allocate additional resources to the regions. We must see that these decisions are implemented in full; this funding needs to be allocated to the regions as quickly as possible. Second. It was decided to expand the regions' capacity to finance their expenditures. In addition to other things, the maximum amount of credit lines allocated to each constituent member of the Federation will be increased as part of a budget loan. As I said earlier, this year it is up to 10 percent of the region's total revenues. It should be noted that there should be no additional conditions to receive such a loan. The money will be available until the end of the fiscal year. In doing so, this year we will completely relieve the regions of repaying the loans granted from the federal budget. These liabilities will be postponed for the period from 2025 to 2029, inclusive. In addition, we will support the fulfilment of obligations on securities and commercial loans taken by the regions and municipalities. This year, budget loans with maturity dates up to 2029 will also be allocated for these purposes. Once again, I would like to point out to our colleagues in the Government the fact that the aforementioned decisions have been taken; it is necessary to implement them without delay, to establish a regulatory framework quickly and to transfer the funds to the regions. Third. A separate measure has been adopted to support the construction industry and ensure its consistent operations. Here we have a clear target: the mortgage loan portfolio, in nominal terms, must grow this year at least as much as last year. Of course, I understand that the situation is changing and the market is changing. This is not a simple goal, but a difficult one; we talked with our colleagues about it this morning. But it is something to strive for. Based on this goal, our preferential and mortgage lending programmes should also be fine-tuned. I look forward to hearing your proposals on this today. I suggest turning to the agenda. Mr Khusnullin, go ahead please. Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin: Mr President, To fulfil the goals you set, we have organised consistent staff work with all government bodies, all customers and all regions. Three headquarters are working and coordinating this, sometimes starting at 7.30 am. We are working like this every day and sometimes even around the clock. The priority task we set for ourselves is to analyse the facilities under our projects in our three-year programme. Our approach is to answer the following questions: how much do they use import substitution and how quickly can we convert them to go without imported components. Luckily, the share of imports in our construction industry is low, and so we believe our main construction projects will not see delays. On the contrary, we will expedite many projects. With this aim in view, we have made many decisions, including those in the package of anti-crisis measures. Of these, 17 decisions directly affect the construction industry and the housing and utilities sector, and 40 decisions have an indirect impact on it. We are carrying them out according to plan; we are issuing directives. We have adopted many laws, and we are carrying out a whole set of regulations. Now we have drafted an entirely new federal targeted investment programme with new approaches and an opportunity to regulate and adjust it with a lot of flexibility. Our goal is to complete the drafting of this programme before May 1 with due account for our three-year timeframe with a forecast for five years because this sustainable guaranteed programme allows us to quickly adjust it. Even if something goes wrong – either because of import substitution or logistics, we will be able to replace some facilities with others and will complete our annual programme, overall. We have drafted many legal decisions for this purpose. As I said, they allow us to be flexible in our management. This is the first point. Second, literally yesterday, we drafted a law in cooperation with the Finance Ministry. Many companies have asked us to adopt this law. It amends 44-FZ to allow the purchase of construction services on a turnkey basis: designing, prospecting, supplies and construction in one go – and then to promptly change any decisions. We have finalised the advance payment mechanism that the regions are now waiting for, and we will issue the relevant document in the next few days. (The Deputy Prime Minister went on to speak about controlling the rising materials costs, adding that the price hikes for metallurgy products have been stopped. He talked about providing financial assistance to the regions, expanding housing construction and maintaining the mortgage portfolio. In his words, the current mortgage portfolio is valued at 13 trillion rubles, or 11 percent of GDP. Mortgages account for 10 percent of the banking system's assets, 15 percent of overall lending, and 47 percent of retail loans. He also spoke about supporting developers.) As for the most important measures to support infrastructure construction, we have made decisions on budget loans for infrastructure development totalling 864 billion rubles, including all the instructions that you have issued. This includes support for the Nizhny Novgorod Region, the Chelyabinsk Region, the Krasnoyarsk Territory, as well as the treatment facilities on the Black Sea coast. At this point, only one project mentioned in your instructions is up in the air – the Northern Latitudinal Railway in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Area. We propose not to scrap it, just postpone it for a year, because it includes concession agreements, which they are unlikely to be able to fulfil in the current situation. It is worth 50 billion, and we propose distributing the funds among the regions. This is the first proposal. (The Deputy Prime Minister also raised the issue of supporting the regions, in particular, granting their requests to replace previously approved projects if they have difficulties implementing those projects, which is actually an anti-crisis measure. Marat Khusnullin spoke about the work to improve housing and utilities sector, about the preparation of a major development programme for the housing and utilities sector, as well as public transport and road construction.) Our Safe and High-Quality Roads project is the most recognisable and the most supported among Russians. It has the highest rating among all national projects. We are working on the three main tasks and goals included in your Executive Order. One of them is to bring 85 percent of the motorways in the country's 105 largest urban areas up to standard by 2024. The second task is to bring 50 percent of regional roads up to standard, also in 2024. This way, Russia will have a backbone regional road network with more than 50 percent high-quality roads. The target is actually about 72 percent across the country. This is very important work. We also continue improving the country's backbone road network, which now includes 138,000 kilometres of roads. I once reported to you that this backbone network includes federal, regional and municipal roads, and we need to improve as much of it as possible. If additional funds are allocated, we could also start this part of our work. We have a lot of work to do to widen roads, because many of the roads we have today need to be widened. It is much cheaper and much faster, and the road's capacity is doubled. In fact, we have prepared a five-year programme and are ready to submit it to the Government with the exact number of facilities we plan to build. With an allocation of about 120 billion more this year, we can guarantee that these figures will be fulfilled, and we will try to fulfil them ahead of schedule. (Marat Khusnullin also reported on the progress of the Moscow-Kazan-Yekaterinburg motorway construction and its subsequent extension to Perm and Chelyabinsk, including rebuilding the road from Yekaterinburg to Chelyabinsk, and on the development of several legislative mechanisms for the transport sector.) We also have a question on lending to commercial facilities. This is also a large sector of the economy. We have not worked this out yet; first we need to deal with housing. The next step is to finalise commercial construction, because this is also an important sector that is not only involved in construction, but also creates jobs. In general, thanks to the decisions you listed, we believe we can accomplish most of our plans. Thank you for your support and constant attention. This concludes my report. (Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov and Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov commented on the report by Marat Khusnullin.) Vladimir Putin: Let's sum up a bit. In general, I agree with the proposals made today. What would I like to comment on? First, I suggest supporting the Government's proposals and allocating additional funds for the construction and repair of roads in the regions this year. The amount given today was at least 120 billion rubles. I propose proceeding from this sum. Now the Minister of Finance is confirming these agreements, and we will continue to do so. Second, the special measures we discussed today in detail, are necessary to support certain sectors of the economy, including those that have faced restrictions on the export of their products. Mr Manturov has mentioned the metallurgists once again. We need to quickly deploy infrastructure plans and launch new construction projects in order to encourage demand for these products, as I said, primarily in the metallurgical industry, to increase demand within the country. Mr Khusnullin reported that the Government is already working on this. Please keep it under constant control. Third, we have to be sure that new facilities appear on the housing market so our citizens, Russian families, have a real opportunity to purchase housing, including through mortgages. Of course, we can see how the situation on the mortgage market has changed. And if we calculate the market rate, the real market rate on loans, then of course, it has increased noticeably. On average, it should have been about 20 percent or even more. Let me outline our principled position: we will not change the rates for our special mortgage programmes, namely: six percent for the family mortgage, three percent for the rural mortgage, and two percent for the Far Eastern mortgage. But I would just like to point out that each of these programmes has time limits: some end in late 2022, some in late 2023, and others end in late 2024. We will talk about this later, but people should also be aware of this and plan their expenses in a timely manner depending on the family budget, when carrying out their plans to improve their living conditions. At the same time, we will flexibly regulate our other programme – a preferential mortgage in general, which was launched back in 2020 as an anti-crisis measure. Let me remind you that we introduced it as part of a whole package of measures to overcome the socioeconomic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. And it was temporary, also temporary. Today, the rate for such preferential mortgage is seven percent, and the maximum loan is the same for all regions and amounts to three million rubles. Mr Khusnullin said today that, taking into account the trends in the mortgage market, the Government proposed to amend this programme by increasing the maximum amount of a preferential mortgage for the capital regions – Moscow, St Petersburg and the Moscow and Leningrad regions – up to 12 million rubles, and for all other regions up to six million rubles. Let us do that. Agreed. It is also proposed to increase the rate up to 12 percent. However, let me emphasise that even in this case it will be significantly lower, almost two times lower than the current market rate, almost twice, as I said, because it is about 23–24 percent. And this rate will be only 12. Let us see how all these solutions work. I would like to remind you again: the target is for the mortgage loan portfolio this year to grow no less than last year. I repeat once again: it is difficult, we all understand this, but we need to strive for this. If its dynamics differ from the planned figures, it will be necessary to make appropriate amendments and adjust the parameters of the preferential mortgage. Finally, I consider it necessary to provide additional support to developers in the current conditions. I agree with our colleagues who said this. Not only to continue simplifying the regulatory framework, but also to launch a new programme of preferential lending to construction companies that develop territories and promote projects to create high-quality modern housing. I ask the Government to draft such a programme and start implementing it. We have covered our agenda for today. I want to thank you all for being well prepared for today's meeting. I know it involved hard work at all levels. I hope, I am sure that all the proposed areas of work, all the parameters will certainly be achieved. Thank you very much."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68031,Meeting with Novgorod Region Governor Andrei Nikitin,2022-03-22T14:05:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow","Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with Novgorod Region Governor Andrei Nikitin, who updated the President on the socioeconomic situation in the region.","The President noted that industrial production and construction were growing in the region, that the unemployment rate was below the average for the country as a whole, and the budget situation had normalised. However, there were issues that required attention. The Governor said that the people's real disposable incomes were growing for the first time in years. The region reported a surplus budget, mostly thanks to exports, and the year was very good in terms of exports by leading manufacturers. The authorities are introducing a social contract mechanism. Over the past two years, some 12,000 social contracts have been signed, and 80 percent of them are seen as effective, that is, they have helped increase families' incomes. This exceeds the national average and is a major step towards improving people's quality of life. Andrei Nikitin, who was appointed Novgorod Region Governor in 2017, added that the number of students at Novgorod State University had increased from 7,000 to nearly 13,000, and this figure included not only local residents but also young people from other regions. The number of students at vocational training schools had increased from 8,000 to 15,000. In the past, only local residents studied at these higher educational institutions, but today they attract students from 30 regions. The Governor pointed out that this makes it possible to envisage the development of modern industries and that the authorities are already preparing to meet the challenge of providing housing for young people. According to the Governor, the region has risen from 41st place to 8th in the Education Ministry's ranking of the quality of education. The region's colleges have risen from 42nd to 13th place in the WorldSkills ranking. As for Olympiads, the region's representatives started from scratch and today, some 1,500–2,000 Novgorodians take part in various Olympiads. This creates a foundation for the future, for growth and development. The governor thanked the President for supporting the development of a special economic zone and an innovative valley. The economic zone was launched last August. Eight investors are already starting to build their production facilities. The governor and the President also discussed the general quality of life and the effectiveness of improvements. The share of well-maintained roads in the region has increased from 28 to almost 50 percent. The governor said that road maintenance had been a long-term issue for the Novgorod Region. It is not completely resolved but local residents are already noticing changes. As a result of all these general improvements, Andrei Nikitin believes that, for the first time in decades, people have actually started moving to the region, especially young people, students and young professionals. Healthcare remains a complicated issue that requires serious efforts. The Novgorod Region has always lagged behind many other regions when it comes to public healthcare. Some progress was achieved but the Covid-19 pandemic substantially worsened the picture. However, the mortality rate among the able-bodied population in the region has decreased and continues to decline. Primary care development efforts should also have a certain impact. Andrei Nikitin reported on efforts to preserve historical memory, specifically, in connection with the federal programme aimed at restoring military graves. The number of school students involved in patriotic projects has doubled. There are patriotic groups in every school. A memorial called Zhestyanaya Gorka was built as per the President's instruction. It is the first memorial to the civilians killed by Nazis during the Great Patriotic War. The first trial that recognised the act of genocide against the peoples of the Soviet Union was held in the Batetsky District of the Novgorod Region. The governor also reported that, in accordance with his earlier promise to the President, the Church of the Life-Giving Trinity had been restored in Sopiny. The construction of the church was funded by the outstanding 18th century Russian military commander Alexander Suvorov. The church was finished after Suvorov's death. For many years, the church was dilapidated but today it is once again a fine and beautiful place of worship."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68025,Meeting with Governor of Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Area Dmitry Artyukhov,2022-03-21T13:50:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin held a working meeting with Governor of the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Area Dmitry Artyukhov.,"The discussion covered a broad range of issues linked with the region's economic development. Vladimir Putin noted that the region is one of the national leaders. Its GRP increased by over 10 percent last year, with industrial production also on the rise. Agriculture went up by over 9 percent despite tough climate conditions, and the construction sector grew by 60 percent. The President emphasised that there are still issues that require more attention, such as the large amount of dilapidated housing and environmental problems. The Governor started his report with a coronavirus update. He said the healthcare system is generally coping. Everything necessary, such as medications and protective gear, is available. The region ranks first in testing. Two infectious disease hospitals were built in Novy Urengoi and Salekhard based on the Defence Ministry's designs. Mobile diagnostic centres based on the Kamaz truck are available for remote areas. People can receive a full screening there: ECG, fluorography and whatever else is required. As for economic figures, all the region's indicators are in the black for energy, the main economic sector: production of gas, oil and gas condensate. Industrial production has increased by 17 percent, while investment exceeds a trillion rubles. This affects the social indicators. The region is in the lead in key areas. It has low poverty and unemployment rates and high revenues. All this is very important for demographics. The region comes one of the first in Russia in natural population increase. The Governor told the President how he managed to reduce infant mortality to the national average and how the region launched a pilot project last year, offering free prenatal genetic tests to all those who needed them. Vladimir Putin said that this practice is very important, and that all Russian regions should follow this example. The discussion also touched upon the progress of the national renovation projects focusing on relocation from dilapidated housing, creating a comfortable urban environment, construction of kindergartens and schools, as well as the opening of an airport in Novy Urengoi this year. Dmitry Artyukhov reported an increase in the populations of the indigenous peoples of the North and those who are involved in traditional communities. Reindeer breeding – one of the traditional trades – is showing an upward trend. The governor also spoke about the Snezhinka research station in the Arctic, which is a joint project with the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. There is progress in designing the unmanned postal delivery system and the use of drones at gas production fields. Dmitry Artyukhov also spoke about the wages of public sector employees in the Arctic. After reaching a certain service record, they become eligible for ""northern"" wage premiums. Many organisations are experiencing a shortage of workers. There would be more flexibility in resolving this issue if northern wage premiums were paid to workers from day one. The governor explained that the northern wage premiums are accumulated and can reach 80 percent. But young professionals receive zero unless they have lived in the North for a certain period of time. The governor believes that this may be an impediment for younger professionals to move to the North, be it law enforcement, security, tax or other specialists in under-staffed sectors and industries. Resolving this problem could help reinforce federal agency work staff. Vladimir Putin found this proposal fair and promised to instruct the Government to make appropriate proposals as soon as possible."

Sport.","President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, Greetings to everyone at the open Russian Winter Paralympic Games. You have gathered in the wonderful city of Khanty-Mansiysk, where people love sports, are proud of their sports traditions and, with great enthusiasm, supported the decision to hold these competitions for you, the best Paralympic athletes on the planet. I am sure that you will fully feel the hospitality of Khanty-Mansiysk residents and, of course, the kindest emotions of fans, who will warmly support you and your brilliant performances. There is no doubt that all this will give you a powerful boost of energy and help you achieve the best results and impressive world records, and win an honest and uncompromising fight, where the fundamental values ​​of sport, free of politics and discrimination, will dominate. Unfortunately, in recent years, a lot of major international competitions have been marked by events that are incompatible with sports, its spirit and atmosphere. We have repeatedly witnessed dubious and biased judging, slander, aggressive acts and outright provocations; we have seen how the ideas of Pierre de Coubertin are methodically falsified and distorted, and the once sacred principles of sports become blurred. Right before our eyes, equality turned into perverted tolerance, justice became double standards, and the fight for clean sport became a politically biased dictatorship of the anti-doping bureaucracy. The Olympic movement took a heavy blow with so-called shared responsibility, which was first launched by international sports officials at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. All this leads not only to the loss of authority and independence of organisations that are important for the development of world sports, but also to the violation of the Olympic Charter, including the key thesis that the Games are a competition between athletes, not between states. The height of cynicism was the suspension of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the Paralympics in Beijing. It was not just innocent athletes but Paralympic athletes who suffered– people who were not discouraged but overcame the most difficult trials in life, people who are worthy of all possible support and admiration, those who, by their example, give hope to millions, making people believe in themselves and in their strength. Russia, which has always adhered to the ideals of sports and Olympism, will not put up with the deprivation of athletes or their mentors on their biggest day. They have been preparing for this for a long time. And we decided to hold our own competition, open to Paralympic athletes from around the world, to recognised leaders and debutants, to everyone who truly cares about sport and its values. I know that here in Khanty-Mansiysk you will prove that you are the best, strongest, most courageous and talented athletes. We are proud of you! I wish you all great success and, of course, exceptional victories!"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68016,Concert marking the anniversary of Crimea's reunification with Russia,2022-03-18T16:15:00Z,Moscow,"Vladimir Putin attended a concert marking eight years since Crimea's reunification with the Russia, at the Luzhniki Sports Centre in Moscow.","President of Russia Vladimir Putin:""We, the multi-ethnic nation of the Russian Federation, united by common fate on our land…"" These are the first words of our fundamental law, the Russian Constitution. Each word has deep meaning and enormous significance. On our land, united by common fate. This is what the people of Crimea and Sevastopol must have been thinking as they went to the referendum on March 18, 2014. They lived and continue to live on their land, and they wanted to have a common fate with their historical motherland, Russia. They had every right to it and they achieved their goal. Let's congratulate them first because it is their holiday. Happy anniversary! Over these years, Russia has done a great deal to help Crimea and Sevastopol grow. There were things that needed to be done that were not immediately obvious to the unaided eye. These were essential things such as gas and power supply, utility infrastructure, restoring the road network, and construction of new roads, motorways and bridges. We needed to drag Crimea out of that humiliating position and state that Crimea and Sevastopol had been pushed into when they were part of another state that had only provided leftover financing to these territories. There is more to it. The fact is we know what needs to be done next, how it needs to be done, and at what cost– and we will fulfil all these plans, absolutely. These decisions are not even as important as the fact that the residents of Crimea and Sevastopol made the right choice when they put up a firm barrier against neo-Nazis and ultra-nationalists. What was and is still happening on other territories is the best indication that they did the right thing. People who lived and live in Donbass did not agree with this coup d'état, either. Several punitive military operations were instantly staged against them; they were besieged and subjected to systemic shelling with artillery and bombing by aircraft– and this is actually what is called""genocide."" The main goal and motive of the military operation that we launched in Donbass and Ukraine is to relieve these people of suffering, of this genocide. At this point, I recall the words from the Holy Scripture:""Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends."" And we are seeing how heroically our military are fighting during this operation. These words come from the Holy Scripture of Christianity, from what is cherished by those who profess this religion. But the bottom line is that this is a universal value for all nations and those of all religions in Russia, and primarily for our people. The best evidence of this is how our fellows are fighting and acting in this operation: shoulder to shoulder, helping and supporting each other. If they have to, they will cover each other with their bodies to protect their comrade from a bullet in the battlefield, as they would to save their brother. It has been a long time since we had such unity. It so happened that, by sheer coincidence, the start of the operation was same day as the birthday of one of our outstanding military leaders who was canonised– Fedor Ushakov. He did not lose a single battle throughout his brilliant career. He once said that these thunderstorms would glorify Russia. This is how it was in his time; this is how it is today and will always be! Thank you!"

Hello. We are meeting on the eve of the Day of Crimea's Reunification with Russia. We all remember that at that time, in the difficult weeks of February-March 2014, residents of Crimea and Sevastopol displayed courage and patriotism and formed a wall against the neo-Nazis and radicals, those who staged a coup d'etat in Kiev. People in Crimea and Sevastopol did not falter. They united and won, making their free conscientious choice – to be together with Russia. The years since then have convincingly proved how correct and timely this choice was. It is enough to look at what is happening in Donbass today and everything becomes immediately clear. However, today I suggest discussing the work on strengthening the socioeconomic potential of Crimea and Sevastopol and planning the tasks on which we should focus in the near future and in the long term. I would like to note that a special programme on the socioeconomic development of the peninsula and a number of other undertakings have been consistently carried out since 2015. A total of 1,375 billion rubles have been set aside for the implementation of this programme over 11 years, until 2025. More than a thousand facilities must be built with these funds. As of today, almost half of them are ready and are already in operation for the benefit of the residents of Crimea and Sevastopol. Our priority was to modernise and develop the transport infrastructure. A modern airport, Simferopol, has been built, the Crimea Bridge is open to motor and rail traffic, and construction work is at its final stage on Tavrida, the newest motorway. The electric power supply to the region has become more reliable and stable, this primarily owing to the commissioning of new generating capacities, the creation of a power bridge, and the replacement of the outmoded regional electric power networks. This has made it possible to eliminate such a serious problem as protracted power outages in residential districts and at production facilities. Step by step, we are solving the problem of providing the residents of Crimea and Sevastopol with clean, I repeat, clean, high-quality water. Immediately after 2014, we started drilling artesian wells and transferring water from reservoirs in the peninsula's highlands to Simferopol and Kerch. Part of the water supply networks has been overhauled, which made it possible to reduce losses in the housing and utilities sector. This was a big problem, everyone is well aware, because nothing in this sense had been done there for decades. Additional water intake facilities have been built. In all the big cities of Crimea, the existing purification stations are being upgraded and new ones are being built. This is also a huge problem that will require a systemic solution and, regrettably, certain time and additional investment. At the same time, we will have to do a lot more to expand the transport, energy and other infrastructures. In this connection, I suggest that we extend the Socioeconomic Development of the Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol state programme until 2027. Its deadline was 2025, but now we need to extend it until 2027 and possibly further on until 2030, envisaging the required co-funding from the federal budget. In this context, I would like to emphasise that the work on all infrastructure projects – where possible – should, of course, be accelerated. Thus, it is necessary to promptly finish the construction of the final, eighth stage of the Tavrida motorway. I have used this road, and it is amazing. The last, eighth stage is more than halfway done; it is an important, key part of the road. When it opens, new convenient and modernised access roads to Sevastopol will appear. Please report today on available reserves to speed up this crucial project. Naturally, it is important to continue the programme to create a comfortable living environment in Crimea and Sevastopol. The total volume of funding this year and for the next years must not be reduced. I am referring to the improvement of courtyards, squares, parks and beaches. You know how this work is going on across Russia; these are very popular measures. And, of course, they are as important for Crimea and Sevastopol as they are for all of Russia. When doing this work, it is necessary to use the best Russian and foreign projects and practices, adopt new architectural solutions, and consider the residents' proposals. It is also necessary to step up major repair and maintenance work on regional and local roads. Mr Khusnullin reported today that overall, this work is underway in Crimea, and the allocated necessary resources – that is, there are even more resources needed – but the allocated resources are being used much more efficiently than in the previous years. A modern, convenient road network provides new opportunities for expanding economic ties, developing tourism, and improving transport logistics. Other infrastructure tasks require urgent attention, including the modernisation of housing and utility facilities and structures, such as the reconstruction of dilapidated and obsolete water and sewage treatment networks. There is much work ahead, and the peninsula's environmental wellbeing directly depends on it. Modern infrastructure is the key to the development of tourism, the agro-industrial sector, and other traditional and new economic sectors on the peninsula. It is necessary to make the most of these opportunities and to support business initiatives. Please report back today on action plans to stimulate additional investment, to strengthen the position of small and medium-sized businesses, and to create high-tech jobs. I would like to note that indeed, Western sanctions on the banking sector and on a number of goods, and so forth, do have an impact on the economic development of the peninsula. A new package of sanctions followed the start of the military operation in Ukraine. I said at the meeting on socioeconomic support for the regions yesterday that the restrictions imposed against Russia certainly create many problems. But, along with creating problems, they also open up new opportunities for us. In particular, major Russian companies now have the best conditions in Crimea. Frankly speaking, they used to be afraid of some kind of sanctions, but now they have nothing to fear. They can safely develop business in the region, including banks by the way, they can start up their activities there, finding and developing new market niches. This applies to the Crimean Peninsula and specifically to the city of Sevastopol. We will certainly support such business activity, including through the deployment of infrastructure for banking and financial services. In this regard, one of our leading banking institutions fully owned by the state, Promsvyazbank, which actually has a presence in Crimea already, should become active in Crimea as quickly and as widely as possible. It should introduce promising banking products, lend to agricultural construction, tourism and other key industries for the region, open departments and branches, and develop its retail network there. This will indeed become a serious incentive for increasing business activity in Crimea, and will promote cooperation with partners from other regions of the Russian Federation. Let us discuss all these matters and hear the reports. <…>"

Taking part in our meeting are senior Government officials, plenipotentiary presidential envoys in the federal districts and heads of Russian regions. We are meeting in a complicate period as our Armed Forces are conducting a special military operation in Ukraine and Donbass. I would like to remind you that at the beginning, on the morning of February 24, I publicly announced the reasons for and the main goal of Russia's actions. It is to help our people in Donbass, who have been subjected to real genocide for nearly eight years in the most barbarous ways, that is, through blockade, large-scale punitive operations, terrorist attacks and constant artillery raids. Their only guilt was that they demanded basic human rights: to live according to their forefathers' laws and traditions, to speak their native language, and to bring up their children as they want. During these years, the Kiev authorities have ignored and sabotaged the implementation of the Minsk Package of Measures for a peaceful settlement of the crisis and ultimately late last year openly refused to implement it. They also started to implement plans to join NATO. Moreover, the Kiev authorities also announced their intention to have nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles. This was a real threat. With foreign technical support, the pro-Nazi Kiev regime would have obtained weapons of mass destruction in the foreseeable future and, of course, would have targeted them against Russia. There was a network of dozens of laboratories in Ukraine, where military biological programmes were conducted under the guidance and with the financial support of the Pentagon, including experiments with coronavirus strains, anthrax, cholera, African swine fever and other deadly diseases. Frantic attempts are being made to conceal traces of these secret programmes. However, we have grounds to assume that components of biological weapons were being created in direct proximity to Russia on the territory of Ukraine. Our numerous warnings that such developments posed a direct threat to the security of Russia were rejected with open and cynical arrogance by Ukraine and its US and NATO patrons. In other words, all our diplomatic efforts were fully in vain. We have been left with no peaceful alternative to settle the problems that developed through no fault of ours. In this situation, we were forced to begin this special military operation. The movement of Russian forces against Kiev and other Ukrainian cities is not connected with a desire to occupy that country. This is not our goal, as I pointed out openly in my statement on February 24. As for the combat tactics drafted by the Defence Ministry of Russia and the General Staff, this has fully justified itself. Our fellows – soldiers and officers – are displaying courage and heroism and are doing all they can to avoid civilian losses in Ukrainian cities. This is what I would like to say for the first time: at the very start of the operation in Donbass, the Kiev authorities were offered opportunities to avoid hostilities, via different channels, to simply withdraw their troops from Donbass as an alternative to bloodshed. They did not want to do this. Well, this was their decision; now they will understand what is happening in reality, on the ground. The operation is being carried out successfully, in strict conformity with the approved plan. I must note that, encouraged by the United States and other Western countries, Ukraine was purposefully preparing for a scenario of force, a massacre and an ethnic cleansing in Donbass. A massive onslaught on Donbass and later Crimea was just a matter of time. However, our Armed Forces have shattered these plans. Kiev was not just preparing for war, for aggression against Russia – it was conducting it. There were endless attempts to stage acts of subversion and organise a terrorist underground in Crimea. Hostilities in Donbass and the shelling of peaceful residential areas have continued all these years. Almost 14,000 civilians, including children have been killed over this time. As you know, there was a missile strike at the centre of Donetsk on March 14. This was an overt bloody act of terror that took over 20 lives. Shelling has been ongoing during the past few days. They are striking randomly at squares with the fervor of fanatics and the exasperation of the doomed. They are acting like the Nazis did when they tried to drag as many innocent victims as they could to their graves. But what is shocking in its extreme cynicism is not just Kiev's blatant lies and statements that Russia allegedly launched this missile at Donetsk (they have gone as far as this), but the attitude of the so-called civilised world. The European and American press did not even notice this tragedy in Donetsk, as if nothing happened. This is how they have been hypocritically looking the other way over the past eight years as mothers buried their children in Donbass, as elderly people were killed. This is simply moral degradation, complete de-humanisation. It was no longer possible to tolerate this outrageous attitude towards the people of Donbass. To put an end to this genocide, Russia recognized the people's republics of Donbass and signed treaties of friendship and mutual aid with them. Based on these treaties, the republics appealed to Russia for military aid in rebuffing the aggression. We rendered this aid because we simply could not do otherwise. We had no right to act otherwise. I would like to emphasise this point and draw your attention to it: if our troops had acted only within the people's republics and helped them liberate their territory, it would not have been a final solution, it would not have led to peace and would not have ultimately removed the threat – to our country, this time to Russia. On the contrary, a new frontline would have been extended around Donbass and its borders, and shelling and provocations would have continued. In other words, this armed conflict would have continued indefinitely. It would have been fuelled by the revanchist hysteria of the Kiev regime, as NATO deployed its military infrastructure faster and more aggressively. In this case, we would have been faced with the fact that the attack, the offensive weapons of the alliance were already at our borders. I will repeat – we had no alternative for self-defence, for ensuring Russia's security, to this special military operation. We will reach the goals we set. We will certainly ensure the security of Russia and our people and will never allow Ukraine to be a bridgehead for aggressive actions against our country. We remain ready to discuss matters of fundamental importance to Russia's future during the talks. This includes Ukraine's status as a neutral country, and demilitarisation and denazification. Our country has done everything it could to organise and hold these talks realising that it is important to use every opportunity to save people and their lives. But time and time again we see that the Kiev regime, which its Western handlers have charged with the task of creating an aggressive ""anti-Russia"" stance, does not care about the future of the people of Ukraine. They do not care that people are dying, that hundreds of thousands, or even millions of people had to flee their homes, and that a horrendous humanitarian disaster is unfolding in the cities controlled by the neo-Nazis and armed criminals who were cut loose. Clearly, Kiev's Western patrons are just pushing them to continue the bloodshed. They incessantly supply Kiev with weapons and intelligence, as well as other types of assistance, including military advisers and mercenaries. They are using economic, financial, trade and other sanctions against Russia as weapons, but these sanctions have backfired in Europe and in the United States where prices of gasoline, energy and food have shot up, and jobs in the industries associated with the Russian market have been cut. So, do not shift the blame on us and do not accuse our country of everything that goes wrong in your countries. I want ordinary Western people hear me, too. You are being persistently told that your current difficulties are the result of Russia's hostile actions and that you have to pay for the efforts to counter the alleged Russian threat from your own pockets. All of that is a lie. The truth is that the problems faced by millions of people in the West are the result of many years of actions by the ruling elite of your respective countries, their mistakes, and short-sighted policies and ambitions. This elite is not thinking about how to improve the lives of their citizens in Western countries. They are obsessed with their own self-serving interests and super profits. This can be seen in the data provided by international organisations, which clearly show that social problems, even in the leading Western countries, have exacerbated in recent years, that inequality and the gap between the rich and the poor is widening, and racial and ethnic conflicts are making themselves felt. The myth of the Western welfare society, the so-called golden billion, is crumbling. To reiterate, the whole planet is now paying for the West's ambitions and the West's attempts to maintain its elusive dominance by any means possible. Imposing sanctions is the logical continuation and the distillation of the irresponsible and short-sighted policy of the US and EU countries' governments and central banks. They themselves have driven up global inflation in recent years, and with their actions caused rising global poverty and greater inequality across the world. The question now arises – who will answer for the millions who will die of hunger in the world's poorest countries due to growing food shortages? Let me reiterate, the global economy and global trade as a whole have suffered a major blow, as did trust in the US dollar as the main reserve currency. The illegitimate freezing of some of the currency reserves of the Bank of Russia marks the end of the reliability of so-called first-class assets. In fact, the US and the EU have defaulted on their obligations to Russia. Now everybody knows that financial reserves can simply be stolen. And many countries in the immediate future may begin – I am sure this is what will happen – to convert their paper and digital assets into real reserves of raw materials, land, food, gold and other real assets which will only result in more shortages in these markets. Let me add that the seizure of foreign assets and accounts of Russian companies and individuals is also a lesson for domestic businesses that there is nothing as reliable as investing in one's own country. I personally have said that a number of times. We appreciate the position of those foreign companies who continue working in our country despite the brazen pressure from the US and its vassals. They are sure to find additional opportunities for growth in the future. We also know those who cowardly betrayed their partners and forgot about their responsibility to employees and customers in Russia, rushing to earn illusory dividends from joining the anti-Russia campaign. However, unlike Western countries, we will respect property rights. Here is what I would like to point out. We must clearly understand that a new package of sanctions and restrictions would have been imposed on us no matter what. I want to emphasise this. For the West, our military operation in Ukraine is just a pretext for imposing more sanctions on us. Indeed, this time they are concentrated. In the same way, the West used the referendum in Crimea as a pretext, which, by the way, took place on March 16, 2014, eight years ago today, when the residents of Crimea and Sevastopol made the free choice to be one with their historical homeland. To reiterate, these are just pretexts. The policy of containing and weakening Russia, including through economic isolation, a blockade, is a premeditated, long-term strategy. Western leaders are no longer hiding the fact that the sanctions are not directed against individuals or companies. Their goal is to deliver a blow to our entire economy, our social and cultural sphere, every family, and every Russian citizen. In fact, the steps designed to make the lives of millions of people worse have all the attributes of an aggression, a war by economic, political, and informational means, and it is of a comprehensive and blatant nature. Again, the West's top political circles do not even hesitate to talk about it openly. The verbal tinsel of political correctness, inviolability of private property and freedom of speech was blown off overnight. Even the Olympic principles were trampled upon. They did not hesitate to settle their score through the Paralympic athletes. So much for ""sport being separate from politics."" In many Western countries, people are subjected to persecution just because they are originally from Russia. They are being denied medical care, their children are expelled from schools, parents are losing their jobs, and Russian music, culture, and literature are being banned. In its attempts to ""cancel"" Russia, the West tore off its mask of decency and began to act crudely showing its true colours. One cannot help but remember the anti-Semitic Nazi pogroms in Germany in the 1930s, and then pogroms perpetrated by their henchmen in many European countries that joined the Nazi aggression against our country during the Great Patriotic War. A massive attack against Russia has also been unleashed in cyberspace. An unprecedented information campaign has been launched through global social networks and all Western media outlets, whose impartiality and independence have proved to be a mere myth. Access to information is being restricted and people are being crammed full of all sorts of fake stories, propaganda, and fabrication, or simply put, snake oil. It even got to the point where American social media companies said straight out that it was possible to post calls for the murder of Russian nationals. We realise what kind of resources this empire of lies has at its disposal but, all the same, when confronted with truth and justice, it is helpless. Russia will never stop trying to make its position clear to the whole world. And our position is honest and open, and an increasing number of people hear, understand and share it. I want to be as direct as possible: hostile geopolitical designs lie behind the hypocritical talk and recent actions by the so-called collective West. They have no use – simply no use – for a strong and sovereign Russia, and they will not forgive us for our independent policy or for standing up for our national interests. We still remember how they supported separatism and terrorism by encouraging terrorists and bandits in the North Caucasus. Just like in the 1990s and the early 2000s, they want to try again to finish us off, to reduce us to nothing by turning us into a weak and dependent country, destroying our territorial integrity and dismembering Russia as they see fit. The failed then and they will fail this time. Yes, of course, they will back the so-called fifth column, national traitors – those who make money here in our country but live over there, and ""live"" not in the geographical sense of the word but in their minds, in their servile mentality. I do not in the least condemn those who have villas in Miami or the French Riviera, who cannot make do without foie gras, oysters or gender freedom as they call it. That is not the problem, not at all. The problem, again, is that many of these people are, essentially, over there in their minds and not here with our people and with Russia. In their opinion – in their opinion! – it is a sign of belonging to the superior caste, the superior race. People like this would sell their own mothers just to be allowed to sit on the entry bench of the superior caste. They want to be just like them and imitate them in everything. But they forget or just completely fail to see that even if this so-called superior caste needs them, it needs them as expendable raw material to inflict maximum damage on our people. The collective West is trying to divide our society using, to its own advantage, combat losses and the socioeconomic consequences of the sanctions, and to provoke civil unrest in Russia and use its fifth column in an attempt to achieve this goal. As I mentioned earlier, their goal is to destroy Russia. But any nation, and even more so the Russian people, will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors and will simply spit them out like an insect in their mouth, spit them onto the pavement. I am convinced that a natural and necessary self-detoxification of society like this would strengthen our country, our solidarity and cohesion and our readiness to respond to any challenge. The so-called collective West and its fifth column are accustomed to measuring everything and everyone by their own standards. They believe that everything is for sale and everything can be bought, and therefore they think we will break down and back off. But they do not know our history and our people well enough. Indeed, many countries around the world have long put up with living with their backs bent, obsequiously accepting all the decisions that come from their sovereign, looking up to it subserviently. This is how many countries live. Unfortunately, in Europe, as well. But Russia will never be seen in such a miserable and humiliated situation, and the fight we are waging is the fight for our sovereignty and the future of our country and our children. We will fight for the right to be and remain Russia. The courage and fortitude of our soldiers and officers, the faithful defenders of the Fatherland, should inspire us. Colleagues, Clearly, the ongoing developments are drawing a line under the global dominance of Western countries in politics and the economy. Moreover, they call into question the economic model that has been imposed on the developing countries and the entire world in recent decades. Importantly, the obsession of the United States and its proponents with the sanctions is not shared by the countries that are home to more than half of the global population. These states represent the fastest growing and the most promising portion of the global economy. That includes Russia. Indeed, it is difficult for us at the moment. Russian financial companies, major enterprises, small and medium-sized businesses are facing unprecedented pressure. The banking system was the first to come under sanctions, but our banks dealt with this challenge. They are working literally around the clock to make payments and settlements between individual clients and to ensure the functioning of enterprises. The second wave of sanctions was designed to set off panic in the area of retail. According to estimates, over the past three weeks, additional demand for goods has exceeded one trillion rubles. However, our manufacturers, suppliers, transport and logistics companies did everything humanly possible to avoid major shortages in retail chains. I would like to thank the business community and the teams at companies, banks and organisations, which are not only responding effectively to sanction-related challenges but are also laying the foundation for the continued sustainable development of our economy. I would like to make a special mention of the Government, the Bank of Russia, regional governors and regional and municipal teams. In the current tough conditions, you are carrying out your responsibilities admirably. Obviously, the attempts to organise an economic blitzkrieg against Russia, demoralise our society and push us around have failed, and so we are sure to see attempts to bring even greater pressure to bear on our country. But we will overcome these difficulties as well. The Russian economy will adapt to the new realities. We will strengthen our sovereignty in science and technology, allocate additional resources to support agriculture, the processing industry, infrastructure, and housing, and continue developing foreign trade ties to tap into rapidly growing, dynamic international markets. Clearly, in the new realities we will have to make deep structural changes in our economy, and I will not pretend that they will be easy or that they will not lead to a temporary increase in inflation and unemployment. In this situation, our task is to minimise such risks. We must not just meet all the social commitments of the state but also launch new, more effective mechanisms for supporting our people and their incomes. We will focus on protecting mothers and children and supporting families with children. We have already made a decision – you know about it – to introduce as of April 1 payments for children aged 8 through 16 in low-income families. The size of the payment will range from 50 to 100 percent of the subsistence minimum for every child. Currently the national average is up to 12,300 rubles. Thus, we will have a uniform system of support from when a mother first becomes pregnant until the child turns 17. I am instructing the Government to oversee the operation of this system so that it quickly detects any changes in the material status of families. That is, it is necessary to make sure families start receiving state support as soon as possible if the parents lost their jobs or faced other difficult circumstances. I also ask the Government to promptly analyse the efficacy of the measures to support those who have lost their jobs. Such measures must obviously be expanded, through the social contract mechanism, among other. I am aware that the price hikes are a big blow to people's incomes, and so we will take action to increase all social payments shortly including benefits and pensions, we will raise the minimum wage and the minimum subsistence level and also the wages of public-sector workers. I ask the Government to calculate the exact parameters for the increases. To emphasise, even under the current difficult conditions we must reduce poverty and inequality by the end of the year. This issue remains quite solvable even now. I ask the Government and the regions to focus on this task. I will add that we understand that it is not only an economic issue but also one of social justice. At present, much depends on the lead of the heads of the constituent entities of the Federation and their readiness to assume responsibility. I signed an executive order today on additional powers for heads of regions – they will be authorised to take flexible and responsive decisions to support our citizens, the economy and social policy in light of the situation on the ground. Let me remind you that we streamlined our steps in fighting the coronavirus in exactly this way, making it possible to consider the situation in each region, city and village – and the situation is different everywhere. I am instructing all the departments of federal bodies in the constituent entities of the Federation to coordinate their work with the regional authorities, and governors must establish operational centres to ensure economic development and to personally lead this work. What is the priority here? Private businesses must play the key role in overcoming the current problems as they can quickly rework logistics, find new suppliers and increase output of in-demand products. Supporting employment, incomes and wages and supporting the stable, balanced performance of the economy in general depend on how quickly private businesses will be able to find the right solutions and take them. That is why we must respond to external pressure with the utmost entrepreneurial freedom and with support for business initiative. I want the Government, law enforcement agencies and oversight authorities to continue their work on lifting unnecessary administrative and regulatory barriers. Furthermore, it is unacceptable to distract the private sector and regional authorities from addressing the most pressing tasks and burden them with all sorts of inspections and oversight procedures. The lack of working capital and the unavailability or high cost of loans is among the key problems facing companies now, and the Central Bank was forced to take appropriate measures. In this regard, I am ordering the following steps to be taken. First, companies that fulfill orders placed by government authorities and companies partly owned by the state should be paid for the delivered goods and services as soon as possible, and reinvest the proceeds into business. In this regard, I propose increasing the amount of advance payments under government contracts. The advance payment must amount to at least a half of the total amount of a contract, and the payment term for the delivered goods and services should be reduced to seven business days. A similar decision must also be made at the level of the constituent entities of the Federation, municipalities and companies with state participation. Second, it is imperative to improve entrepreneurs' ability to raise additional resources from development institutions, by which I mean expanding the Project Financing Factory's activities (it is working well, and we know from practice that its services are in demand), providing resources for business investment plans through the Industry Development Fund (which is one of the really well-performing tools), the Bank for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises, and also through regional support institutions, including guarantee funds. I hereby instruct the Government to allocate additional funds to the constituent entities of the Federation to fund these regional tools. I want the Government and our colleagues in the regions to pay attention to the fact that the most important task is to ensure the availability of goods on the consumer market, primarily essential supplies, medications and medical products. Logistical complications and other objective problems that result in price surges must be resolved quickly. At the same time, it is imperative to rule out intervention in price regulation. The increased supply of goods and nothing else should lead to a decrease and stabilisation of prices. Separately, I would like to address our exporters. Whenever deliveries to international markets do not run smoothly, you should send extra batches of goods to the domestic market rather than reduce your production rates. This should objectively reduce domestic prices, including those of gasoline, diesel, bitumen, metals, and other export goods. I want the Government and the Federal Antimonopoly Service, as well regional authorities, to monitor these markets at all times. Furthermore, considering the new challenges faced by Russia, we must maintain and expand our long-term development agenda, including the implementation of all planned federal and regional projects. We must make full use of the potential of our budget system as a tool for stimulation. As we agreed, federal funding for various projects, including construction projects, will be carried out in full. Moreover, in December we decided on allocating additional funds if construction costs went up for objective reasons. I consider it important to note that there will be no problems with federal budget funding in the current situation. Our economy is generating adequate revenue. This means we will not have to resort to emissions. In simple terms, the Central bank will not have to print money. We have revenue – sound market revenue. The problem is not rooted in money. Let me repeat that we have the resources. The main difficulties are related to the supply of spare parts, technology and construction materials, and the need to organise the work of subcontractors. Therefore, the deadlines and the methods for implementing specific projects and project phases may be subject to change. This will require the smooth operation of government bodies and business representatives and expediting the implementation of import substitution programmes. This is an important point. In the process, it is also important to simplify the procedure for cooperation between the regions and the federal government bodies and give the regions of the Federation more freedom in using resources and more opportunities for launching new construction projects and programmes. Additional funding for road construction has already been allocated to the regions. I would like to ask the Government to consider an increase in funding other infrastructure facilities so work can start this year, and the possibility of building up purchases from Russian companies, for instance, with a view to upgrading public transport. Obviously, this will be a serious additional burden on the budgets of the regions of the Russian Federation. Therefore, as we agreed, we will additionally adjust the subsidies to even out fiscal capacity. We will also use other measures for supporting regional finances. Thus, all payments on budget loans scheduled for this year will be suspended and payments on commercial loans will be replaced with budget loans wherever necessary. I would like to ask the Government to study this issue in detail and dig to the bottom of every case. Only a case-by-case approach will produce the desired effect. In addition, the Finance Ministry will provide an additional unconditional credit line for every region. It will amount to 10 percent of total revenue with repayment no earlier than the end of this year. We are going to maintain the same volume of infrastructure budget loans. I am instructing the Government to make arrangements for flexible management of this programme and to take account of the challenges involved in the implementation of the projects that I mentioned earlier. The regions should be able to take swift action on altering the portfolio and the contents of the projects, and focus on the ones that can be implemented as efficiently as possible in the current circumstances. If need be, we will explore the possibility of increasing the volume of infrastructure loans. This is possible and is quite feasible. In general, we will closely monitor regional finances and make additional decisions to support them, if need be. I would like to emphasise that direct communication between all levels of government and a clear sequence of actions are of paramount importance now. The State Council and its specialised commissions have proved their effectiveness. I want the public administration commission led by Sergei Sobyanin to team up with our colleagues from the Government and to focus on problematic items on the regional agenda, to come up with the best solutions and to scale them to all Russian regions. We have gained extensive experience from combating the pandemic. Colleagues, Our economy, the state budget and private sector possess the necessary resources to address long-term tasks. All strategic and national goals that we have set for the period to 2030 must be achieved. The current challenges and the opportunities that they offer should mobilise us – this is what we should set our minds to in order to achieve tangible results in the interests of our people. Clearly, we will need to fine-tune our programmes, and we welcome the initiatives coming from business circles, academics, and public associations. In this regard, I want the regions to join in organising the forum convened by the Agency for Strategic Initiatives titled, Powerful Ideas for New Times, where every Russian citizen will have a chance to present their proposals and specific projects for advancing their respective cities, regions, and our country as a whole. To reiterate, the current developments represent a challenge for all of us. I am confident that we will come through with dignity. By working hard and working together, by supporting each other, we will overcome all challenges and emerge even stronger, as has always been the case in the thousand-year history of Russia. That is how I want you to think about this work. Let us move on to discussing the agenda. <…>"

Head of the Federal Medical-Biological Agency Veronika Skvortsova Skvortsova VeronikaHead of the Federal Medical-Biological Agency(FMBA): Good afternoon, Mr President. Our task was to create a new antiviral triad: a test system, an antiviral medication and a vaccine against the coronavirus. Since March 2020, we have created a series of high-precision and high-sensitivity AmpliTest kits. We started by creating test kits for the SARS-Cov-2 virus and then proceeded to create the AmpliTest system to detect, differentiate and identify its new strains. In particular, we created test kits for the Alpha, Beta and Gamma strains in March 2021 and for Delta and Delta Plus in July 2021. In early December, we created an AmpliTest kit, which can be used to detect three variants of the Omicron strain. This is important because it helps us to evaluate the epidemiological situation, forecast its future course with due regard to the fundamentally different properties of the Omicron and Delta strains, and to make the necessary calculations for our medical organisations. In December, we registered a medicine, Mir, the world's first medication based on viral interference. It is a precision gene engineering preparation that switches off one of the sites of the SARS-CoV-2 virus genome, the most conservative one that does not change in all known lines. Vladimir Putin: Is it for treatment? Veronika Skvortsova: Yes, for treatment. Actually, it is an antidote, because it can reduce the viral load by 10,000 times and does not affect the human genome in the process. It is a highly secure medication that is not toxic to humans. But at the same time it works after the first inhalation. When inhaled, dendrimeric peptide in the preparation targets the delivery of the active ingredient to the upper and lower respiratory tracts. The medication was registered in December, in the first instance, for moderately and seriously ill inpatients. Currently, research is being conducted at the outpatient level in order to use the medication whenever a patient tests positive for COVID-19. It is most effective at this stage. Experience shows that three inhalations per day for five days is enough to turn a positive PCR test into a negative one. The medication was devised by the Institute of Immunology. Vladimir Putin: In St Petersburg? Veronika Skvortsova:… In Moscow, but it is produced by the St Petersburg Research Institute of Vaccines and Serums at its facilities. Yet another medication, Leitragin, which we registered last year, also switches off one of the sites of the SARS-CoV-2 virus genome. But it is a pathogenic rather than an aetiotropic antiviral medication, which makes it possible to fully prevent the development of cytokine storm in moderately ill patients. It is also an inhaled medicine. We have 35 research centres, all of which are working hard. This is all we can report for now, but we have a lot of interesting R&D options under way. Vladimir Putin: I see. And what about this? Veronika Skvortsova: This is AmpliTest, as I said, a testing of Omicron and it variants. And Delta, separately. Vladimir Putin: I see. Veronika Skvortsova: It is produced by the Centre for Strategic Planning, also the FMBA's research centre. Vladimir Putin: All right. Thank you very much. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67982,Working meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Grigorenko,2022-03-14T15:30:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with Deputy Prime Minister – Chief of the Government Staff Dmitry Grigorenko.,"Dmitry Grigorenko informed the President about the progress made in fulfilling his instructions concerning the reform of the oversight system in the Russian Federation. The discussion focused on ways to improve the mechanism of the 'regulatory guillotine', mandatory pre-trial appeal, standardisation of rules for introducing mandatory requirements for business, and the introduction of a risk-based approach. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon. Deputy Prime Minister – Chief of the Government Staff Dmitry Grigorenko: Mr President, the Government of the Russian Federation is now reforming the oversight system in accordance with your instructions. In 2019, we launched the 'regulatory guillotine' mechanism, essentially aimed at conducting an inventory and updating all existing mandatory requirements, cancelling redundant or irrelevant ones, and re-approving effective ones. I report that we have completed this project. As a result of this work, we have conducted an inventory of all existing mandatory requirements. Out of just over 318,000 requirements, slightly more than 143,000 were cancelled as irrelevant, redundant, no longer necessary or viable. The remaining requirements have been updated and reapproved. It is important to note here that the Government was not carrying out this project alone, but with the participation of business representatives. We have set up 43 industry-specific groups, with two-thirds of the representatives of business communities and business associations, and in fact, those groups did most of the work. A little less than a year ago, when you visited us at the Coordination Centre, you noted and emphasised that the Government was to take account of feedback from business associations and individuals in its decision-making. As we took inventory and updated mandatory requirements, we certainly paid heed to the feedback from citizens and business associations, which the Coordination Centre helped collect. We also understand well that now our task is not to remain complacent. We must avoid the adoption of new mandatory requirements that are either outdated or excessive. This is why we drafted a federal law and adopted it a bit over a year ago. We have a legally approved provision that says all mandatory requirements in the Russian Federation are subject to reapproval once every six years. This is a very important time interval. Why? Because requirements are verified and updated, if necessary, during these six years. In addition to establishing common rules and uniform standards for introducing mandatory requirements, it is also important that two dates have been fixed legally to introduce them: March 1 and September 1. Before, every department had its own rules and procedures. In practical terms, this is very convenient for both businesses and the state. Why? Because it enhances the discipline of the state that has to adopt mandatory requirements within a certain time frame. Businesses appreciate this even more because, first, they know when to expect the publication of requirements, and second, they have an opportunity to prepare for their introduction the best they can. It is also important to note that, in addition to the 'regulatory guillotine' mechanism, a significant role belongs to the form of monitoring compliance with any mandatory quality requirements because in general it is possible to disrupt any of these and any regulations through the type of control. This is why we reformed the control and oversight procedures at the same time. Eighteen months ago, we adopted a federal law on control and oversight. In addition to establishing common uniform rules, standards and definitions for all oversight bodies, it introduced, by law, an obligation to apply a risk-based approach, and we are already doing this in practice. This is important because it changed the entire procedure and approach to control and oversight. Now an inspection is scheduled not based on the letters of the alphabet or the existence of a plan but proceeding from risks and the correlation to maximum or minimal risks applied by each oversight department. In simple terms, if a business falls in the minimal risk zone in terms of compliance with mandatory requirements, the probability of it being inspected is close to zero. We are already seeing positive results from this. The number of inspections has been cut more than in half compared to 2019. We conducted a bit over 1.5 million inspections in 2019, and a little over 700,000 inspections in 2021. So they have been reduced by over two times. I am deliberately not comparing this figure with 2020 because, as you recall, we had a moratorium in the pandemic year. Vladimir Putin: Of course. Dmitry Grigorenko: This included inspections. But we understand that our oversight activities are a constant search for a balance between the interests of the state and the interests of business, and disputes are inevitable where these interests meet. This is why we simultaneously conducted separate reform aimed at simplifying, as much as possible, a procedure for challenging the results of inspections. What was it like before? If there was a dispute on the results of an inspection, was there any recourse? Perhaps only in court. But any court process always takes time, lawyers and money, while time is a major resource for businesses. So, we have adopted a legally binding standard on introducing a mechanism for a mandatory pre-trial appeal. This is how it works. A complaint is lodged via the gosuslugi government services website in the digital format. It must be reviewed within 20 working days at most. An applicant receives a response to his complaint via the government services website as well. This is all without fees, quick and convenient. Importantly, the entire pre-trial appeal system and the inspections are recorded in the Unified Information System. This is a cloud-based system. In other words, we are seeing all procedures in real time from the start of an inspection to the end and from the start of a complaint to its resolution. We know who is being inspected, why, and the results of the inspection. We have integrated this system into the prosecutor's office with which we must coordinate our plans for inspections by law. Naturally, this system allows us to see in real time the status of the procedure and the cause-and-effect relationship with a view to adjusting both the procedure and the law wherever necessary. Vladimir Putin: All right. This is really very important. We have been working on this for years. I hope very much that what has been done recently, including with your participation, will have a positive impact on the national economy in general. Dmitry Grigorenko: Mr President, I would like to thank you for the adopted decisions and the support for these reforms, because without these decisions we would have hardly accomplished this. However, we understand that we should not stop at this but should move further. We will continue working on upgrading the mandatory requirements, including the removal or minimisation of red tape and detailed adjustments in control and oversight procedures. Seeing the first results of the pre-trial appeal system upon its launch, we will naturally continue improving this mechanism. We hope that after the implementation of these measures, people will complain less, if at all. Vladimir Putin: All right."

We meet regularly, exchange information by telephone, and adjust our actions. First of all, before we get down to our agenda, I would like to congratulate you on the successful referendum on amending your country's constitution. I know that the turnout was high, and popular support across Belarus very solid. President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko Lukashenko AlexanderPresident of Belarus: More than at the presidential elections, by the way, by 1.5 percent. Vladimir Putin: Good. I believe the political process that you initiated, the dialogue that you have with your people is extremely important for the situation to remain sustainable and stable. This kind of situation, I mean stability and sustainability, is essential for economic development. In this regard, I would like to note that last year, our mutual trade increased by more than a third, more than 34 percent, and now that the annual results are being summed up, this is becoming quite obvious. The overall developments are positive. Of course, there are also problems caused by the current events, the restrictions and sanctions we all know of, and so on. But, as you and I have previously said, we have seen this before– attempts to limit our development, to contain it. Now they are being made on a larger scale; this much is obvious, of course. I am sure that we will get through the difficult period and, in fact, will gain more competencies, find more ways to feel independent and self-sufficient, and will ultimately benefit, as it happened in the previous years. I will certainly update you on Ukrainian developments and, above all, the progress of the negotiations, which are now being held almost on a daily basis. There are certain positive shifts there, as our negotiators have reported to me. I will tell you about all this in greater detail. Alexander Lukashenko: Mr Putin, indeed, you and I communicate closely at all times. We had a premonition of hard times. I have told you over the phone more than once: the Russian Federation, and even more so Belarus, is always under sanctions, which have become more extensive today. However, we are already used to this, pardon my language, beastly Western behaviour. Why beastly? Because it is illegitimate, as they are fond of saying, and runs counter to international agreements and treaties, which they and we have joined, in part. So, once again, the third time round: this is just disgraceful from my point of view. I have already been through this, and you have had enough of it as well. Here is my point. As I walked up to your office, the journalists hollered from a distance:""Will we survive the sanctions or not?"" Listen, this is not the right approach to this matter. Today, sanctions represent an opportunity for us. I am a Soviet person, and you hail from the Soviet period as well, and you are well aware that we were always under sanctions, but we lived and moved forward notwithstanding. It is just that due to the current circumstances, which are not even related to sanctions, not enough time has passed, and our people are concerned. It is a good thing that people tend to realise over time what is really going on. It was not us who attacked them, not us, the armed forces of Ukraine started shooting when you and I were at your place two days before that. Vladimir Putin: Unfortunately. Alexander Lukashenko: Yes, you and I were in a helicopter, as[we] received updates. They were the ones to start this whole thing. I will now show you the location, which they planned to use as a base to attack Belarus. If there had not been a preventive strike on the positions– four positions– six hours before the operation– I will show you the map that I brought with me– they would have attacked the troops of Belarus and Russia, which were conducting exercises. So, we did not unleash this war, our conscience is clear. It is good that they started it. Biological weapons, the largest nuclear power plants– they were ready to blow that all up. We are witnessing what is going on in Chernobyl, you asked me to supply electricity… Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Alexander Lukashenko:…but they do not need it, do you see? They just do not need it. They do not care about what is happening there, and we used force to supply electricity to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, as promised. Vladimir Putin: I am aware of that, thank you. Alexander Lukashenko: These are their goals. But people are gradually beginning to understand what is what and who is right. Trust me, had we not done this 24 hours in advance, we would have drained this cup to the dregs with enormous losses several days later. I will say it again: they were going to strike not only at Donbass but had also prepared their positions for a strike against Belarus. And today– as I said yesterday– these foreign mercenaries are walking along the Belarus border to the Chernobyl plant. There are three points here. They want to cut off the routes of moving Russian troops and stab them in the back, as I said. This is the first point. Secondly, they want to attack the positions of the troops that remained in Belarus after their joint exercises with Russia. And they still hope to draw us directly into this slaughter to make us leave the western section unprotected. They are not that simple. We still have to figure out what they want to do in Chernobyl. So, we have no need to justify ourselves before anyone. Vladimir Putin: No one is justifying themselves. Alexander Lukashenko: You– yes. I see that some of our or your people tend to say that they did something wrong. They would have drained more from this cup than in the middle of the last century when the fascists were moving towards us. So, this is a time of opportunity. If we find our bearings, believe me, in six months or by the end of the year people will forget this happened, in terms of the economy. And we should not say""we will survive the sanctions"" or""we will not survive the sanctions."" Look, we have survived them so many times. We must develop our economy. We can do without them. We have everything we need for normal life and work. I have a suggestion. We have always helped our allies. We helped the Kazakhs, and others as well. You opened your market to some, I will not mention their names because they will take offense. Well, we have to meet somehow in the CSTO and the EAEU. We must unite. Everyone says we must be together. Let us get together. And, believe me, if we add these markets to our cooperation we will forget about the sanctions in a month. So, the CSTO and the EAEU. I am making a proposal. After all, I do have the right to make a proposal… Vladimir Putin: Of course. Alexander Lukashenko: I think you will support me. We need to gather around the table in Moscow, sit at the negotiating table and come to terms: we sell this to you and you sell this to us, and build our common economic policy on this foundation. This is why I came to Moscow today in a normal mood. I am confident we can do it better than we did after collapse of the USSR, and even in the USSR. This is not a situation where we should bother and get worried about some event. We simply need the time– a lot can be seen from a distance. Vladimir Putin: You are absolutely right. The Soviet Union indeed always lived in conditions of sanctions but developed and achieved enormous success. I said yesterday: even after 1990, the sanctions imposed on the USSR were retained and then extended to the new, recent times. These are CoCom lists, restrictions on high technology. This is how it was done. Now a massive blow is being dealt at the economy. But practice over the past few years shows that wherever the West imposed restrictions on us, we acquired new competences and restored our old skills at new technological levels. And all this is working. We have of course become stronger in this respect, you are right. This is indeed a time of opportunity when we must strengthen our technological and economic sovereignty. This is why we are meeting today, we will talk about everything in more detail. Thank you. <…>"

We have an issue on our agenda that is not connected with the current events. But first of all, I would like to ask our colleagues attending this meeting if they need to exchange any information on the current events. Mr Shoigu, please. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu: Mr President, We are proceeding as planned, as we have been reporting to you every day this week. I would like to suggest three issues for discussion and to ask for your approval. Vladimir Putin: Go ahead, please. Sergei Shoigu: We are receiving a huge number of requests from all manner of volunteers from different countries, who would like to come to the Lugansk and Donetsk people's republics to take part in the liberation movement, as they say. The largest number of requests, over 16,000, has come from the Middle East. We believe that we should grant these requests, especially since the matter does not concern money but a genuine desire of these people. We know many of them; they helped us fight ISIS in the most difficult period, during the past 10 years. This is the first point. The second, Mr President. In light of the uncontrollable arms deliveries to Ukraine from all parties (it appears that nobody is looking where and how much of these weapons are being delivered and who they are being issued to), as we have pointed out many times, we suggest turning the air defence systems, for example, man-portable SAMs, and anti-tank missile systems over to the Lugansk and Donetsk people's republics to build up the combat ability of their militia. In addition, we have seized a large number of Ukrainian weapons, such as tanks, armoured vehicles, all types of small arms, and artillery systems. There are also many Javelins and Stingers. We suggest transferring them to the Lugansk and Donetsk militias as well, so that they can defend their republics more effectively. Finally, the third and more serious issue, Mr President, and I am asking for your approval. The General Staff has analysed all the measures taken by the West to beef up their forces near Russia's western borders. New units are arriving every day, and they are deploying them at a time when absolutely nothing threatens them. Nevertheless, we believe that they want to take advantage of this situation and to saturate the area along the border with forces and resources to the maximum extent, and they will undoubtedly want to preserve this situation for a long time. Consequently, the General Staff is drafting and has nearly completed a plan for reinforcing Russia's western borders, including, naturally, with those new modern systems and the deployment of military units to defend our western borders. We are waiting for your instruction, so that we can report on our proposals at the next Security Council meeting or in any other format, for their subsequent approval. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: All right, thank you very much. Regarding the mobilisation of mercenaries from all over the world and sending them to Ukraine. We can see that Ukraine's Western sponsors and the Ukrainian regime are not concealing this fact. They are doing this openly and neglecting norms of international law. So, if you see that some volunteers would like to come and help the people in Donbass, especially without pay, then we should meet them halfway and help them relocate to the war zone. This is the first thing. The second, regarding weapons deliveries, especially those of Western weapons that have been seized by the Russian Army. I, of course, support the decision to hand them over to the military units in the Lugansk and Donetsk people's republics. Please do this. I am ready to issue any resolution that may be necessary at my end. The third matter deals with the reinforcement of the Russian Federation's western borders in view of the NATO countries' actions in this area and in response to what they are doing. This calls for a separate discussion. I would like to ask you to prepare a report on the issue separately. We will make the decision following its discussion in the near future. Thank you. Let us proceed to the current item on the agenda. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67958,Meeting with Government members,2022-03-10T17:55:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",The President held a videoconference meeting with Government members.,"The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Anton Vaino, First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov, First Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Sergei Kiriyenko, deputy prime ministers Viktoria Abramchenko, Yury Borisov, Tatyana Golikova, Alexander Novak, Marat Khusnullin, Dmitry Chernyshenko, Deputy Prime Minister – Chief of the Government Staff Dmitry Grigorenko, Deputy Prime Minister – Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoy to the Far Eastern Federal District Yury Trutnev, Presidential Aide Maxim Oreshkin, Economic Development Minister Maxim Reshetnikov and Finance Minister Anton Siluanov. The heads of a number of ministries, the Accounts Chamber and the Central Bank were also invited to attend. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues, Today, we will discuss a set of measures to minimise the consequences of sanctions on the Russian economy and the people of our country. We communicate on these issues almost every day. I just discussed a number of them with the Prime Minister. Let's get to work. I would like Mr Mishustin to start the discussion. Please go ahead, Mr Mishustin. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin: Mr President, colleagues, Mr President, under your instructions, the Government is working to increase the stability of the economy amid the unprecedented increase in external pressure. A special headquarters has been formed, which coordinates the activities of all departments, including at the regional level. We are monitoring the situation practically 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with the assistance from business leaders and expert community associations. Steps to protect the most vulnerable areas are being worked through sector by sector so that all aspects of operations in specific sectors and enterprises are taken into account as fully as possible when preparing decisions. Our core goals include protecting the domestic market and ensuring uninterrupted functioning of enterprises by eliminating disruptions in logistics and production chains and, of course, maintaining employment. It is important to help the people and businesses quickly adapt to the changing circumstances. Two sets of draft laws with anti-sanction measures as the top priority, that's about 20 draft laws in all, and the Government acts that are necessary to implement them, have been promptly prepared. They include specific proposals for stabilising financial markets, supporting a number of industries, ensuring sustainability of the domestic private sector, and also proposals for the return of capital to Russia's jurisdiction. A draft law to prevent manufacturing shutdowns has been prepared. If foreign owners shut down their facilities without reasonable grounds, the Government is proposing the introduction of external management. Depending on the owner's decision, this will determine the future of the company. In the process, the key goal will be to maintain profile corporate activities and jobs. Most companies are announcing temporary suspension of operations while preserving jobs and salaries. We will carefully monitor this situation. As for industry-specific decisions, we have prepared a package of measures to help the IT industry on your approval, Mr President. Thus, all relevant companies will be relieved of profit tax liability and inspections by regulatory bodies. Of course, we will continue creating conditions to attract specialists into this sector of the economy. We have proposals on supporting the construction industry as well. We will simplify the drafting of urban development plans and the procedure for holding public hearings on them, as well as registration of rights to facilities already built. We will expedite the allocation of land plots and extend existing lease contracts if necessary. This will allow the industry to maintain a consistent pace. Regarding the interests of transport companies, we will assist airlines in maintaining their fleets of foreign aircraft. We will introduce restrictions on countries that ban our ships from entering their ports. We will try to level out the influence of international companies on the operations of Russian railway transport. The tourist industry will also receive preferences. We will suspend the VAT for companies that build and lease tourist facilities or that subcontract operations to other companies. This will be valid for five years after hotels or other accommodation facilities are put into service, including after a rebuilding. The owners of existing hotels will also be entitled to these benefits. This is how we will support this industry and give it new opportunities for development. A number of provisions will apply not only to small and medium-sized businesses but also to large companies, including backbone companies. At this point, companies will need to adjust their production and logistics chains. This is why a ban was introduced on re-export to countries that joined the sanctions restrictions on equipment and parts that had previously been brought into Russia. We are particularly focusing on agriculture workers' needs. Agriculture is not only about jobs, but also about ensuring the country's food security. It is extremely important to avoid a disruption in the sowing season, which is now underway in some regions. Agricultural producers will be able to postpone, by six months, their principal debt payments under low-cost investment loans, which they were to transfer to the banks within the next three months, and to renew short-term loans for another year to reduce the financial burden. In both cases, we are talking about loans with term expiring this year. To cut business costs, we suggest minimising the number of redundant procedures. Pursuant to the law you signed, a resolution was prepared to renew the validity of licenses and other types of permits and to introduce a simplified procedure for obtaining and re-issuing them. This measure will apply to over 120 types of such permits; this is over 2.5 million permits in all. We have also simplified the requirements for compliance with certain technical regulation measures. A moratorium has already been imposed on almost all scheduled and unscheduled measures of control, unless they involve a threat to life or health. We propose eliminating over 150,000 scheduled inspections. Another solution is to postpone the entry into force of a number of mandatory requirements concerning businesses. Under the current circumstances, they cannot be met due to technical restrictions and the need to re-equip Russian enterprises. We understand the scale of the transformation that our economy will have to go through to become even stronger. Maximum freedom of economic activity in the country, minimal regulation and control and, of course, support for the labour market will remain the basis for our economic response. The Government will expand import substitution and help domestic producers replace foreign products in supply chains. Mr President, We are working on anti-sanctions measures on a systemic basis. The existing action plan will be constantly updated based on developments and be adopted in stages and promptly. My deputies and the heads of the key departments will get into more detail about the directions of our activities. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Thank you, Mr Mishustin. Clearly, in times like this, people tend to have an increased demand for certain groups of goods, but there is no doubt that we will overcome these problems in the regular course of business. Gradually, people will come to realise that there are no issues that we are unable to resolve. Indeed, there are issues that need special attention, but I will bring them up later myself and ask our colleagues to comment on them. Mr Siluanov, please go ahead. Tell us about measures to stabilise the domestic financial market. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov: Mr President. Over the past two weeks, the Western countries have basically launched a financial and economic war against Russia. The West has announced a default on its financial liabilities to Russia and frozen our gold and currency reserves. They are doing all they can to stop foreign trade and the export of goods, thereby inflicting damage on global trade. Western countries are trying to create a shortage of imported everyday essentials in Russia and compel successful businesses with foreign capital to shut down. Under the circumstances, our priority is to stabilize the situation in the financial system and ensure uninterrupted operations. We have taken a number of measures to this end. First, we have taken precautions to control the outflow of capital abroad. This applies to cross-border transactions by companies and individuals. We have established a special procedure for servicing external debt, including our national debt. We will pay off our external liabilities in rubles and carry out the conversion by de-freezing our gold and currency reserves. We have taken measures to attract capital to this country. To achieve this, we have introduced mandatory surrender of foreign exchange proceeds, increased ruble interest rates, suspended the introduction of taxes on individual interest income for two years, suspended the VAT on the purchase of gold, and launched a large project on capital amnesty. We have also ensured the uninterrupted operations of financial institutions. Their liquidity is fully guaranteed by the Central Bank, and regulatory requirements have been relaxed. We are ready to adjust our dividend policy to replenish banks with capital. These measures have already produced results. The situation on the outflow of deposits is being stabilised and the amount of cash withdrawals has been reduced to almost zero even though they were fairly substantial just recently. The situation with the balance of payments is also improving. Current account receipts are balancing out capital flow. In cooperation with the Bank of Russia, the Government will continue taking measures to ensure the sustainability of the financial system. Mr President, I would like to say a few words about the budget. Overall, the situation in the public sector is under control. Non-oil and gas revenue is expected to decrease, but this will be offset by an increase in oil and gas revenue. We will use this revenue to reduce borrowing and public debt in the current circumstances and to fund priority spending. We will coordinate our budgetary activities with the Central Bank. It is important to keep inflation in check. Meeting our social commitments is a top budget priority. We will ensure the payment of pensions, benefits, salaries and other payments in a timely manner and in full. Medicines are provided as planned as well, including for children with complex diseases. We use the Circle of Kindness Foundation for this. In May, low-income families with children will start receiving new payments. We will earmark additional spending for these purposes in the budget system. The Government has begun to implement anti-crisis measures. Our top priority is to maintain employment and jobs, and to support people who need help under the current circumstances. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much. Here is what I would like to say. We have adopted very elaborate development programmes. Of course, we need to work thoroughly on all these programmes, I mean budget programmes at all levels. I am aware that your ministry, the Ministry of Economic Development, is analysing these matters under the leadership of the Prime Minister, and corresponding decisions are being made. Just yesterday we discussed this with the Prime Minister as well as with you. Nevertheless, it is necessary to develop additional mechanisms to ensure the sustainability of regional budgets. We are all aware of this, and I just want you to pay attention to it. With regard to the countries that are taking hostile steps towards our country and our economy, we are well aware that they are calling on their citizens to tighten their belts, to dress warmer and are pointing to the sanctions that they are imposing on us as the reason for the deterioration of the situation in their respective countries. This is very strange, especially since we are meeting our commitments. Once again, I want to emphasise that we are respecting all our commitments regarding energy supplies. Deputy Prime Minister [Alexander] Novak talked about this a couple of days ago. Everything that we are supposed to supply, we are supplying to our core consumers in Europe and other regions of the world in full; even the Ukrainian gas transit system is filled to 100 percent under our contracts. This may be surprising, but it is true. We are doing all this. Prices are increasing in these countries, but not because of us. This is the result of their own miscalculations, so they cannot blame us for that. The same goes for higher oil and petroleum product prices in the United States. They announced that they were shutting down imports of Russian oil to the US market. Prices there are high, and inflation rates are unprecedentedly high, too, probably an all-time high. Still, they are trying to blame us for the consequences of their own mistakes. This is obvious to the analysts, because Russian oil distribution to the US does not exceed 3 percent. This is a negligible amount, but their prices are up. We have absolutely nothing to do with that. And even the ban on Russian oil imports has absolutely nothing to do with it. They are simply hiding behind these decisions in order to once again deceive their own people. They are already trying to reach agreements with countries they imposed illegitimate restrictions on at some point before. They are now ready to make peace with Iran and sign all the documents right away, and with Venezuela as well. They went to Venezuela to have talks. But of course, they should not have imposed these illegitimate sanctions in the first place. The same will happen in relations with our country, I have no doubt. However, along with our partners – the ones who do not recognise these illegal actions – we will certainly find a solution to all the problems they are trying to create for us. Getting back to what I started with, I want you to once again take a closer look at possible additional mechanisms for ensuring the sustainability of regional budgets. In general, things are stable and calm in the regions. I communicate with regional heads every day. I just want you to pay attention to this and support them in a timely manner. (Minister of Labour and Social Protection Anton Kotyakov Kotyakov AntonLabour and Social Protection Minister reported on the new benefits for low-income parents with children aged 8 through 16. A total of five million children in this age group live in families that will be eligible for these new benefits. Another measure is to extend for 2022the 50 percent cashback programme for children's summer camp holidays.) Vladimir Putin: Mr Patrushev, please. Minister of Agriculture Dmitry Patrushev Patrushev DmitryMinister of Agriculture : Thank you, Mr President. The agricultural sector, including processing facilities, is operating in regular mode. The situation in the food market is stable. Products are supplied to shops in good time. We maintain contact with regional authorities and the Ministry of Industry and Trade. Next, winter crops have been planted across 19 million hectares and more than 96 percent are in good or satisfactory condition. This is more than the year before and higher than the average rate in recent years. We are approaching the critical stage of the spring planting season. Despite external restrictions, we made sure that we were ready to go forward. The planting started earlier than in 2021. Spring crops were planted on an area of more than 200,000 hectares. Some 3 million hectares of winter crops were additionally fertilised. According to the 2022 plans, the total cultivated area this year will be extended to 81.3 million hectares, which is almost 1 million hectares more than in 2021. We have expanded the amount of grain, grain legumes, oil-bearing crops, sugar beets, potatoes and field vegetables planted. I should add that we continue to update our agricultural fleet. In 2021, agricultural companies purchased 63,000 machines and pieces of equipment, including 10,000 under the special funding programme of Rosagroleasing. No disruptions in fuel and lubricant supplies have been reported. We are closely monitoring the situation with our colleagues from the Ministry of Energy. As concerns mineral fertilisers, their availability and price are under constant supervision by an ad hoc inter-agency centre. The overall situation is stable. According to forecasts, in 2022 agricultural companies will purchase 5 million tonnes, which is 500,000 tonnes more than in 2021. We are not lowering the bar when it comes to fertilisation. The average amount nationwide should reach 60 kg per hectare of arable land, or 5 kg more than last year. Finally, I would like to note that we have sufficient workforce capacity to complete the spring sowing process. Mr President, To conclude my report on the spring sowing campaign, I would like to reiterate that the preparations for it by the relevant agencies, regions, and farmers themselves has been organised comprehensively and in a timely manner. We expect to receive 123 million tonnes of grain, 22.6 million tonnes of oil-bearing crops, 41.5 million tonnes of sugar beet, 6.8 million tonnes of industrially grown potatoes, and 5.2 million tonnes of field vegetables. And a few words about other areas of the agro-industrial sector. As regards animal husbandry, according to preliminary estimates, the production of cattle and poultry in 2022 will reach some 16 million tonnes; the production of milk will be around 32.5 million tonnes. This is a little more than last year. In the fisheries sector, the forecast for 2022 exceeds 5.1 million tonnes of aquatic biological resources; some 387,000 tonnes of fish will be bred at farms. Processing facilities also continue to work steadily, providing uninterrupted supplies of food to the population. The production index in the food and processing industries in 2022 will reach 101 percent, and 102 percent for the production of beverages. So, I want to emphasise again that our country's food security has been ensured. Russia fully meets its own needs in all the main products. I also want to add that we are ready to fulfil our export obligations. (The Minister also spoke about state support for the agro-industrial sector, the concessional loan programme, providing subsidies for the transportation of mineral fertilisers, grain and other agricultural products, and the mechanism of state interventions – purchasing grain and sugar from farmers for the intervention fund). Vladimir Putin: Good, thank you. We discussed these issues yesterday, or the other day. I know that the expected yield is good overall. I am sure it will be. Our agricultural producers know their job and have proven it many times over the past few years. We still have good export potential. We know our partners, they are showing interest in maintaining contacts and it will be very difficult for them to complete their tasks, including providing food to their citizens, without our direct participation. But we will speak about this more later. In this regard, I would like to hear a comment from Mr Manturov because agricultural production is closely related to how this work is assisted by the production and oil sectors. Please, you have the floor. Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov Manturov DenisDeputy Prime Minister – Industry and Trade Minister : Mr President, colleagues, I will begin with food retail. Over the past few days, shops have been experiencing a huge increase in customers, with people seeking to stock up on essential supplies, primarily those with a long shelf life: grains, sugar, pasta, canned food, and flour. Therefore, the priority for us is to ensure the regular and timely delivery of these goods to the shops. In this regard, we can benefit from the experience of the first Covid wave when there was an entire framework for coordinating the efforts of the Industry and Trade Ministry, the Agriculture Ministry, the Transport Ministry, the Anti-Monopoly Service, and the regions, and efforts to work together in order to control the commodity distribution network enabled us to balance supply and demand. This has been confirmed by the retailers, as well as by data from the Federal Taxation Service. Of course, there can be some delays when you need to deliver goods to all shops at once, but this is just a matter of restructuring the supply channels. Moreover, with the most essential products, retail chains have already built up sufficient stocks. In fact, we are repeating what happened in March 2020 when we were able to stabilise the situation in a matter of days, and everyone could see this with their own eyes, so they can rest assured that this will be the case this time as well. In fact, we are already doing this. As for prices, our former foreign partners adopted an irresponsible position, which drove up the prices of imported goods. However, as Mr Patrushev has just said, over 90 percent of essential goods are produced in Russia. The Government moved to support both the agricultural producers and the trade sector. In response, we expect all market actors to contain the prices of household goods. After all, there have been quite a few positive examples of major retail chains taking voluntary steps to minimise their margins and offsetting their costs by charging more for mid-range and premium products. When it comes to essential goods, the Government has at its disposal a state mechanism for regulating the prices of low-end products. We have never used it yet, and in the current conditions we will make use of it only as a last resort if there is an unjustified increase in prices. At the same time, we need to do everything to promote entrepreneurship, as you said recently, Mr President. We must remove all excessive restrictions regarding fairs, markets, kiosks, stands and mobile retail businesses, in order to remove any barriers preventing private farms from selling their produce through these channels. With your consent, we are ready to promptly develop and submit to the Government a draft executive order on further steps to promote unimpeded trade. Now, as for the industrial sector, our main task today is to secure the operation of plants and factories with an emphasis on accelerated import substitution. We have determined what parts and raw materials are required for manufacturing end products in all industries. Some of them are already produced here and we will increase their output. To this end the Government has provided additional money for the Industrial Development Fund. We will also use concessional loans for starting mass production of the products that are being developed. Priority areas for advanced import substitution include: aircraft building, power engineering machine-building, radio electronics and the rehabilitation industry. And, of course, pharmaceutics: we have increased our competences and production facilities in this area over the recent decade and the situation during the pandemic confirmed this once again. We have built about 60 up-to-date factories. All our enterprises, including those with foreign participation, continue operation under current conditions and express their readiness to stay in our market. The next stage of import substitution is intended to develop independence in terms of biological and chemical substances, raw materials and equipment. It will allow us to meet all national needs in medications for treating such socially significant diseases as oncological, cardio-vascular and orphan diseases, HIV, diabetes, and some others. We have built plants for synthesising substances in Moscow, St Petersburg, Kurgan and Bratsk over the last two years. They continue to expand their production capacity and their product range. So far, we can import the remaining raw materials from friendly countries such as China and India, which are, by the way, the main suppliers to the rest of the world. And in general, Mr President, our industrial and trade enterprises have been switched to an intensified operation mode. The report is over. Vladimir Putin: Good, thank you. Here is what I would like to point out, and it is something we have said many times before: we are not going to cut anyone off. We are open to working with all our partners, our foreign partners who want this. In this context, the rights of our foreign investors and colleagues who have decided to stay in Russia and are working in Russia must be securely protected, and I am asking the Government to keep this in mind. As for those who are planning to shut down production, we must act firmly to prevent any damage to the local suppliers, the Russian providers of components and materials. In such cases, as the Prime Minister has proposed, we should introduce external management and subsequently turn such enterprises over to those who want to work. There are enough legal, market instruments; there is no need to permit any arbitrary actions. We will find legal solutions to these issues. There are several other things we should take into account. For example, we have already discussed the energy sector. The problems that are being created for us in the fiscal sphere, with the financing of certain transactions, with logistics and insurance, are already influencing energy prices on global markets. There is one more very important sphere, which our colleagues have mentioned today: fertilisers. The global situation is extremely challenging. It was complicated even before the events related to Ukraine. It is deteriorating, because Russa, and incidentally, Belarus, are among the biggest suppliers of mineral fertilisers to the global markets. If more problems are created for us with financing this sector, with insurance and logistics, with the delivery of our products, the prices, which are already high, will grow still more. This will, in turn, have an impact on the end product – on food products. I have already mentioned this, and we discussed this several months ago, that we must by no means permit anything of the kind on our food market. Towards this end, we must first of all ensure the necessary amount of fertilisers on our market, for our agricultural producers; but we can and are ready to supply them to our foreign partners, we have the resources for this. Let me repeat this: if they create any problems for us there, negative consequences for this sector of the global economy are inevitable. Prices will rise even higher, and this will aggravate a number of humanitarian problems, including in those countries that are already struggling and have enough on their plate with feeding their citizens. This circumstance must certainly be taken into account. As you know, we have certain agreements with those countries that are friendly towards Russia, and we will be satisfying their demand for mineral fertilisers unconditionally. This suits the interests of our suppliers as well as the countries I have just mentioned. I ask you to also pay attention to this and, of course, to secure these agreements with our foreign partners – this is very important for them. Denis Manturov: May I comment, Mr President? Vladimir Putin: Yes, please. Denis Manturov: I have just recently met with our colleagues from the mineral fertiliser industry. We made a joint decision to temporarily limit the supply of fertilisers to foreign markets, not because we want to create problems for anyone, but because we are facing logistical problems someone else has created. European carriers will no longer ship our products. Therefore, instead of wasting time at the loading terminals, we decided to use it for proactive maintenance and equipment repair. We do this every year, but taking into account this downtime, we will continue until the situation changes and we have access to our logistics corridors. Once again, we do not want to create problems for anyone, let alone cause a hike in prices. But our colleagues must make an informed decision and give us the opportunity to load and ship our products to the countries that are interested in our supplies. Otherwise, we will redirect our supplies to those markets that are happy to purchase our products. Vladimir Putin: I fully agree with you. This applies to energy as well – the same thing is happening there – oil and gas, including liquefied gas. This certainly applies to fertilisers, and other goods, metals, and a wide range of chemical products. As for fertilisers, if this continues, it will certainly have serious consequences for this segment of the global market and for the food market in general, it will also affect macroeconomic indicators, because inflation will inevitably accelerate in this case, this is simply inevitable. All right. Let us move on. (Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin reported on last year's strong performance in housing and road construction with 92.6 million square metres of housing commissioned and 162 million square metres of roads paved. An anti-crisis programme has been drafted. Work is underway in three areas: support for housing construction, ensuring timely high-quality cash and physical execution of the core programmes with support from the federal and regional budgets, and reducing the duration of the investment and construction cycle. In particular, the Deputy Prime Minister noted that road construction businesses can operate almost independently of imports with Russia accounting for 95 percent of everything needed. The recently adopted decisions make it possible to quickly alter design and technological solutions and to promptly replace equipment and materials. He pointed out the need to quickly revise the options for localising production, creating new supply chains, and changing management, and expressed hope that these measures would minimise losses in the construction industry, which will be a driver behind recovery in the national economy and further growth.) Vladimir Putin: Mr Chupriyan, please update us on where we stand with regard to the situation with the refugees, I mean payments, accommodation, providing schooling to schoolchildren and students, and the epidemiological situation. Go ahead. Acting Emergency Situations Minister Alexander Chupriyan: Mr President, Since the evacuation began, over 213,000 people, including about 50,000 children, have arrived in the Russian Federation through eight checkpoints. Most of the evacuees go to relatives and friends on their own. To date, more than 18,000 people, including over 9,000 children, are staying at 278 temporary accommodation centres in 30 constituent entities of the Russian Federation. Rostov and Voronezh regions have the largest number of evacuees. In addition, over 700 interim accommodation centres have been set up in the regions, and they can accommodate over 55,000 people. Currently, two Emergencies Ministry support camps are operating at checkpoints. They are used to give new arrivals the chance to rest and get warm. Groups for sending them to temporary accommodation facilities (TAFs) are also organised there. Initially, people were moved from the Rostov Region to TAFs in other regions by motor vehicle. Later, we started using rail for this purpose, and I would like to give my special thanks to Russian Railways for their prompt action. In all, almost 13,000 people, including over 4,000 children, have been moved by train since the beginning of the humanitarian operation. In addition, about 206 Turkish citizens were taken home via a special flight this morning. Another 13 foreigners are now staying in a TAF, and the Foreign Ministry is working to send them home. Mr President, We are involving employees of the Emergencies Ministry, local government bodies, organisations and institutions in the regions, and volunteers from NGOs at the TAFs. The victims are being assisted in processing documents to receive payments and medical aid. About 10,000 people have received medical assistance. The Justice Ministry has organised mobile teams to provide legal aid to the evacuated. Psychologists from the Emergencies Ministry are working with victims around the clock, and a hotline has been established. Literally on the second day, Rospotrebnadzor employees under the direction of Anna Popova organised COVID-19 testing for everyone in the TAFs. Those testing positive are put into separate areas in the TAFs or sent to medical institutions where they receive the required treatment and care. Evacuated schoolchildren have the opportunity to continue their studies either remotely or at local schools. In all, 13,162 schoolchildren are now studying at Russian schools. Pursuant to a Government resolution, the Russian Emergencies Ministry delivered 280 tonnes of cargo from the Federal Reserve on February 24, including tents, furniture, food, building materials, bedding and essential supplies to the evacuees. At the same time, the authorities of the constituent entities and public organisations have launched a nationwide campaign to collect humanitarian aid for the affected people. The cargo delivered to the interim accommodation centres exceeds 2,400 tonnes. Volunteers are instrumental in this, and we are very grateful to them. The evacuees were issued free SIM cards with an initial balance provided by a major Russian operator. In addition, the Ministry and the regional authorities are making lump-sum payments to the evacuees. To date, over 35,000 people have applied for one-time financial help, and over 30,000 people have received payments totaling over 304 million rubles. In all, over 8,000 people and 2,000 pieces of equipment are involved in providing assistance to the evacuees. More people are coming with over 6,000 evacuees crossing the border every day. Every one of them is provided with the necessary assistance and is taken to an interim accommodation centre, if needed. There are enough forces and means to take care of everything. Mr President, the Emergencies Ministry is prepared to address any task. This concludes my report, thank you. Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much, Mr Chupriyan. I would now like to address our citizens who are helping the refugees and to thank them for being sympathetic to the people who need our help and support. As I mentioned earlier, these people were forced to live in basements for eight long years. Their children grew up and went to school, but have continued to live in these rat-infested basements for eight years now. It was our duty to help and support these people. There was no other way for us to deal with this situation; we were left with no choice. The fact that our people responded to the evacuees' needs says a lot. This means that, overall, they are supportive of our actions and that we are doing the right thing in supporting Donbass. Here is what I would like to say in closing. We are now discussing ways to overcome the aftermath of the sanctions imposed on Russia and the Russian economy. To reiterate, I have no doubt that these sanctions would have been imposed one way or another, just like they have been in recent years. Moreover, even after the collapse of the Soviet Union, many sanctions and restrictions also known as CoCom lists remained in force. They were imposed on the Soviet Union and remained valid indefinitely with regard to the Russian Federation. All they did was gladly take our payments under the loans issued to the Soviet republics during Soviet times. There has always been sanction pressure. Indeed, we are now dealing with all-out sanctions, which create certain problems and difficulties for us. But just as we got over these difficulties in previous years, we will overcome them now as well. We must live through this period. There is no doubt that the economy will adapt to these newly arisen circumstances. We will continue our policy of import substitution across all areas and ultimately it will lead us to greater independence and sovereignty. You and I are well aware that many countries have adapted to living with their backs bent, obsequiously accepting every decision of their sovereign. Russia cannot exist as a miserable and humiliated entity. Sooner or later, all of that would have happened. It has happened now, and I am confident that thanks to, as I mentioned earlier, the Government and our leading companies, we will overcome this. I would like to thank you for your proposals and decisions, and I have no doubt that we will achieve the goals that we set for ourselves, in this case in the economy, and our economic sovereignty will become even stronger. Thank you very much."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67949,Meeting with Commissioner for Children's Rights Maria Lvova-Belova,2022-03-09T14:15:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with Presidential Commissioner for Children's Rights Maria Lvova-Belova.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ms Lvova-Belova, I know that you have drafted proposals on how to further invigorate your work. It goes without saying that your work is one of the most important activities because you deal with matters such as children's rights. Please, you have the floor. Commissioner for Children's Rights Maria Lvova-Belova Lvova-Belova MariaPresidential Commissioner for Children's Rights: Today, I would like to discuss three matters. First, I would like to talk about the topical agenda regarding families and children who have been evacuated from Donbass. Second, I would like to dwell briefly on our achievements over the past four months and to coordinate strategic aspects of our work with you as my immediate superior. I know that we have very little time, and I will therefore keep to the point. Mr President, please ask me if you need any details. I would be delighted to talk about everything. Vladimir Putin: All right. Maria Lvova-Belova: Regarding evacuated residents and families with children, the relevant commissioners have joined the effort. I asked the Emergencies Ministry to have them as part of the regional headquarters. They are now actively involved in accommodating these people, monitoring the situation and working to fulfil individual requests. Vladimir Putin: Are you talking about regional commissioners? Maria Lvova-Belova: Regional commissioners. I hold regular videoconferences, and colleagues join in from various locations, including railway stations and shelters. They respond to individual requests, such as buying eyeglasses for someone or providing medical assistance. This is one aspect of our work. I have a question I wanted to discuss with you, Mr President. We have 1,090 orphans from various child-care facilities who have arrived. Of course, Russians have big hearts and are already queuing up to take care of these children. What do you think… Vladimir Putin: Very well. Maria Lvova-Belova: If you allow me, I would like to continue along these lines. We have already compiled a registry for those who have documents. Some could be put into temporary accommodation, while those with Russian citizenship could settle permanently. Vladimir Putin: Why only those with Russian citizenship? This must apply regardless of their citizenship. Maria Lvova-Belova: There are some legal caveats here that need to be addressed. Vladimir Putin: Just tell me what they are, and we will work to remove these barriers. We are facing an emergency. I believe that we must focus on the interests of the children rather than think about red tape. Maria Lvova-Belova: Of course. Vladimir Putin: Go ahead and tell us about your proposals, and we will amend the laws accordingly. We will ask the State Duma to do its work, and I am certain that its members will support you. Maria Lvova-Belova: Thank you very much. As for my work, I asked you to give me some time to learn the ropes in this position and get to know what it is all about. I have now learned the ropes and immersed myself in all this, so let me share some takeaways with you. Regarding requests from citizens, we received three thousand of them, on various topics. It is worth noting that the number of complaints about shortages of places at schools decreased six-fold. This is a substantial improvement. Please accept my gratitude for this on behalf of all the families. Vladimir Putin: Good. Maria Lvova-Belova: I decided that in my work, it was essential to hear what children had to say. After all, we are working for them, right? What are their dreams? What do they want? We have a Children's Public Council, which represents children from all the regions of Russia, under the aegis of the federal Presidential Commissioner for Children's Rights. They are already hard at work and are preparing the first national forum titled We Are Against Bullying. We are proactive in reaching out to NGOs, especially in our everyday work when we need their assistance, here and now. A parental platform, featuring leading parent organisations and associations, has been established under the Commissioner. I believe that this platform can be used for constructive interaction with the parental community, which is important. I am paying close attention to interdepartmental cooperation because I understand that there are many overlapping issues. It is very important for us to strengthen this block as much as possible. I am grateful to my colleagues. I have held meetings with all the leaders of relevant ministries and departments, who have given me a warm welcome. We have agreed to cooperate and have already launched these efforts. Together with the Ministry of Education, we have held the first congress of commissioners dedicated to education. Mr President, so much for our areas of work. There are many current issues, but I believe that we should give priority attention to some of them to ensure the best possible outcome. This is why we have outlined four strategic programmes. Vladimir Putin: As a starting point, can you list them, please? Maria Lvova-Belova: Yes, certainly. The first programme is Russia's Teenagers. It has to do with everything that concerns teenagers, including those from risk groups. The programme Children in the Family is focused on preventing social orphanhood and on forms of placement for orphans. The third block, The Country for Children, is about the safety of children and a culture of caring and respect for children, so that our people understand that here there are no somebody else's children. And lastly, Life-Long Support is for children with disabilities and family routing, because they should know that we can provide quality support and assistance, that their families and children have a future. Vladimir Putin: Good, let us talk in greater detail about each of these blocks. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67937,Greetings to Russia's women on International Women's Day,2022-03-08T00:00:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin congratulated Russia's women on International Women's Day.,"Dear women, March 8 is one of our favourite days. It is filled with the most heart-warming feelings. I would like to congratulate you on International Women's Day. I hope that your loved ones will give you heartfelt care and warmth, and that the kindness and sympathy you so generously give to your families, children, grandchildren, colleagues and friends will be returned manyfold. We are living in a difficult time with global environmental challenges and problems, armed conflicts and the need to protect our people and country, the pandemic and the fight for the lives and health of millions of our people. But nothing could stop our men, not even during the ordeals of the Great Patriotic War, from saying words of love to their women, and that love was their pillar of support and inspiration. Today we are saying words of admiration and gratitude to our wives, mothers, grandmothers, sisters, daughters and girlfriends for being so loyal, dependable and supportive in times of trials. For its part, the state will do everything necessary to support families, which is an unconditional priority for us. Monthly government allowances have already been stipulated for pregnant women and low-income families with children aged through 7 years. In addition, allowances are paid to single parents with children aged 8 to 16 years. I think that today we should adopt one more decision: to approve allowances for children aged 8 through 16 years in all low-income families, which we must support. This decision will come into effect on April 1, and these families will receive the first payments in May. Dear women, your tenderness, sympathy and generosity make this world a better and kinder place, and you combine charming tenderness with incredible inner strength. We know how many women work in hospitals, outpatient clinics and ambulances at all levels, from nurses and orderlies to chief physicians. During the past two years you have been working in extremely difficult conditions, under huge and sometimes unbearable strain, fighting selflessly to save the life and health of every single patient. I would like to express my wholehearted gratitude to you. We have special words of respect for our women who are doing their duty in the Armed Forces of Russia. Thank you for your loyalty to the Fatherland. I would like to address the mothers, wives, sisters and fiancées of our men and officers, who are fighting to defend Russia during the special military operation. I know that you are worried about your loved ones. You can be proud of them, just as the whole country is proud and concerned about them. I would like to emphasise that conscripted service personnel are not and will not be taking part in the fighting. And we are not going to additionally call up reservists. Only professional military personnel are fulfilling the tasks set to them. I am sure that they will reliably protect the security and peace of the people of Russia. Today I would like to recall the words written by a woman whom her compatriots described as great and whom people called Mother– Empress Catherine II, whose sculpture stands here, in the Kremlin. She was not a Russian by birth, but she was proud of becoming Russian. Here is what she wrote:""I will defend my homeland with my tongue, with a pen and with a sword for as long as I live."" Today we regard the words""homeland,""""mother"" and""beloved"" to be of the same magnitude to us. And it will always be so. Greetings to you on International Women's Day."

The parties had a substantive discussion on the humanitarian aspects of the current situation. Vladimir Putin stressed, in particular, that the Russian military take all possible steps to save civilians' lives. The main threat is coming from the nationalist formations, which, in fact, use terrorist tactics, hiding behind the civilian population. The President underscored that the Russian Armed Forces had declared a ceasefire several times so as to evacuate the population along humanitarian corridors. However, Ukrainian nationalist battalions prevented this by resorting to violence against civilians and various provocations. The Russian president urged the EU to make a real contribution to saving lives, to put pressure on the Kiev authorities and make them respect humanitarian law. Vladimir Putin also gave an assessment of the negotiations with Kiev representatives and reiterated Russia's demands made earlier."

He drew attention to the fact that the Indian students, who were held hostage by radicals in Kharkov, managed to leave the city only after strong international pressure was exerted on Kiev. Russian military personnel are doing their best to evacuate Indian citizens from Sumy. Narendra Modi expressed gratitude to the Russian side for the efforts being taken to return his compatriots home.

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67918,Telephone conversation with President of France Emmanuel Macron,2022-03-06T16:55:00Z,NA,"Vladimir Putin had a telephone conversation with President of the French Republic Emmanuel Macron, at the initiative of the French side.","After Emmanuel Macron expressed concern for the safety of nuclear power plants in Ukraine, Vladimir Putin explained in detail about provocations carried out by Ukrainian radical nationalists using sabotage groups in the area of the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant. Any attempts to blame the Russian military for this incident are part of a cynical propaganda campaign. Russian troops, in cooperation with a Ukrainian security unit and personnel, continue to ensure the regular operation of the nuclear power plant. Background radiation in the region remains normal. All these facts have been officially confirmed by the IAEA. The physical and nuclear safety of the plant is well protected. The Russian Armed Forces also control the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. All this is being done in order to rule out any provocations by Ukrainian neo-Nazis or terrorists to avoid catastrophic consequences. When the President of France mentioned the IAEA Director General's proposal to hold a trilateral (IAEA-Russia-Ukraine) meeting in the Chernobyl zone to develop a mechanism for ensuring the safety of nuclear facilities in Ukraine, Vladimir Putin commented that he feels it could be a good idea, provided that it be considered whether the meeting should be held via videoconference or in a third country. The parties also discussed evacuation of the civilian population from the areas of hostilities. Vladimir Putin pointed out that Kiev continues to refuse to act on agreements reached on such an acute humanitarian issue. In particular, despite the ""ceasefire regime"" announced by the Russian side on March 5 in order to allow civilians and foreign nationals to leave Mariupol and Volnovakha, Ukrainian nationalists have prevented any and all evacuation from these cities and again used the pause in hostilities to replenish their forces and weapons. The President of France was again asked to be more active in persuading the Kiev authorities to comply with the norms of international humanitarian law. Vladimir Putin also informed the French President about progress in talks between the Russian delegation and Ukrainian representatives. He expressed readiness to continue the dialogue with the understanding that Russia's unconditional and now widely-distributed demands be fulfilled. It is vital that the Ukrainian side remain serious about agreements crucial to achieving cessation of hostilities. The parties agreed to maintain further contacts at various levels."

He emphasised that the special operation was proceeding according to plan and within the agreed timeframe. At the same time, the Russian Armed Forces are making every effort to spare the lives and ensure the safety of civilians and are carrying out pinpoint strikes exclusively at military infrastructure facilities. Against this backdrop, the actions of nationalist and neo-Nazi units, which continue intensive shelling of Donbass and the use of civilians, including foreigners who have actually been taken hostage, as human shields in Ukrainian cities and towns, demonstrate particular cruelty and cynicism. Russia's readiness for dialogue with the Ukrainian authorities and with foreign partners to resolve the conflict has been reaffirmed. At the same time, Vladimir Putin underscored the futility of any attempts to drag out the negotiating process, something the Ukrainian security forces are doing to regroup their forces and weapons. In this regard, he emphasised that the special operation can only be suspended if Kiev ceases hostilities and fulfills Russia's requirements, of which Ukraine is perfectly aware. The parties expressed hope Ukrainian representatives would show a more constructive approach during the next round of planned negotiations, fully taking into account existing realities. The Presidents of Russia and Turkey agreed on the importance of maintaining contacts between the two countries' diplomatic and military agencies. Vladimir Putin reaffirmed Russia's readiness to provide all the necessary assistance for the safe evacuation of Turkish citizens from the combat areas. The parties underlined a mutual commitment to continue mutually beneficial bilateral trade and economic cooperation. It was revealing that Recep Tayyip Erdogan gave a critical assessment of the rampant discrimination campaign against Russian culture and its representatives, which is now gaining momentum in a number of Western states. The parties agreed to maintain close contacts at various levels."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67913,Meeting with female aircrew members of Russian airlines,2022-03-05T16:35:00Z,Moscow Region,Vladimir Putin visited the Aeroflot aviation training centre and met with female aircrew members of Russian airlines.,"Before the meeting, the President inspected flight and emergency rescue simulators at the training centre. They simulate a real-life mid-air environment. The President inspected a cockpit allowing pilots to more effectively control the MC-21 medium-haul narrow-body airliner. He also used a simulator to fly a Sukhoi Superjet 100 airliner in the company of Aeroflot flight detachment commander Maria Kasyanik. Vladimir Putin also visited the unique Water-Land centre, whose specialists train flight crews to deal with emergencies, including water landings, mid-air firefighting operations and evacuating passengers via inflatable ramps.*** President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends, Minister of Transport Vitaly Savelyev, who headed the Aeroflot Group just recently, has been asking me for quite a while to come here and to see this training and simulator centre. By coincidence, the well-known events are taking place, and March 8 is approaching. Therefore, he and I decided not to put off the visit any further and to see the facilities you have here, to find out how they are used and to evaluate this centre's prospects. I should say that all this is quite impressive. Maria Kasyanik has shown me how to control the aircraft, and I moved the joysticks under her guidance. This is really great, all the more so as next-generation simulators are available, the chief has also discussed them, and I have had a look. But, of course, we should use this opportunity to discuss the sector's development prospects. We will probably also talk about the current situation because, naturally, it is impossible to avoid it. First of all, I would like to congratulate you all on the upcoming International Women's Day and to wish you and your colleagues all the best. I will be able to address all women of Russia a bit later. But I would like to say that the sector which we are talking about and where you work and with which you are affiliated employs over 70,000 women, including over 200 pilots and co-pilots, as well as flight attendants, of course, who are a special category and caste. The people in Russia have always treated aviation with great respect and interest, especially for ladies in aviation. I think the first female Russian aviators emerged in the early 20th century, and they won a reputation for themselves during the Great Patriotic War. We know all those famous names of female aviation regiments and their combat record. Today, women work in all positions, including flight controllers, engineers, technicians, and I repeat once again, flight attendants and pilots. On the whole, this is a substantial female force that supplements the aviation sector's male section. I think that is all for opening remarks since it would be more useful and to the point if I answer your questions. So, let's go over to that part now. Once again, congratulations on the upcoming International Women's Day. Remark: Thank you. Do you have any questions? Or shall we just have some tea? Maria Kotova: We have questions. Good afternoon, Mr President, My name is Maria Kotova. I am the co-pilot of the Airbus A320 airliner operated by Aeroflot. My question concerns the current situation in Ukraine. We all support your actions and the special operation underway there. Of course, the most important question that, one way or another, each of us has been asking ourselves lately is: why did this special operation begin? Could it not have been avoided? In our minds, we understand and strongly support your actions, but as women we worry about our families and loved ones who live in Ukraine. We are aware that the civilians are not impacted. But still, we would like you to reassure us: what is in store for us at the end of this road? What is the military operation in Ukraine supposed to end with? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: I will provide a brief overview and start, as they say in such cases, from the""centre of the field."" I mentioned this at the beginning of the operation and even before this decision was made, which was undoubtedly a difficult decision to make. What is this about? The fact of the matter is that after the anti-constitutional coup in Ukraine, which was, unfortunately, strongly supported by Western countries… Let us face it. They are not hiding the fact that they spent US$5 billion on it, handing out cookies on Maidan and so on. And then, instead of bringing the situation back on track, even if it spiralled out of control, even if it was what is known as an excessive act– there is such a legal concept, that is, they planned one thing, but did another. Anyway, they could and should have brought this situation back onto the political track. Moreover, right before the coup, three foreign ministers came to Kiev in 2014, signed an agreement with the incumbent authorities and acted as guarantors of these agreements to the effect that the situation would remain within the political track. Nothing of the kind. They carried out a coup d'état and supported the perpetrators. Then followed the well-known events related to Crimea and southeastern Ukraine, Donbass, whose residents refused to support the coup. As you know, Crimea made a decision, people came to the referendum and voted to once again become part of the Russian Federation. Naturally, we could not but support this, all the more so since they were threatened by nationalists and neo-Nazis. There is a great deal of evidence that they were right. Later on, or practically in parallel, events started in Donbass. What was the outcome? People who began to resist these developments were persecuted. The Kiev authorities started conducting military operations on that territory. They conducted two large-scale punitive operations with the use of heavy weapons and combat aircraft. They attacked Donetsk directly with tanks and bombed its squares from aircraft. Both military campaigns failed. They sustained defeat. This was followed by the emergence of the so-called Minsk Agreements or the Package of Measures, to use its official name. They showed the way to a peaceful settlement of this conflict. And we did everything we could to let the developments follow in this vein to restore Ukraine's territorial integrity and protect the interests of the people who live on these territories. And what did they demand? Basic things: the right to speak their mother tongue, this is the Russian language, and follow their traditions and culture. There were no special demands. Nothing special. But no. These territories were put under siege and switched off from the banking system, food supplies and payments of pensions and other benefits. Sometimes, some handouts were thrown in. But to receive those benefits and pensions people had to cross the delimitation line. Now listen carefully. Maybe this will sound rough but the situation compels me to say such things. You see yourselves that stray dogs attack people in different regions. They injure and even kill people(this is a separate problem and the local authorities must deal with it). Then we see how these dogs are poisoned and shot dead. But, look, people in Donbass are not stray dogs. From 13,000 to 14,000 people have been killed over these years. Over 500 children were killed or mutilated. But what is most intolerable is that the so-called civilised West preferred to turn a blind eye to these events during all these years. Over eight years! Moreover, recently the Kiev authorities began to say bluntly that they are not going to fulfil these agreements. They are saying this from TV screens and online. They are saying on the record:""We don't like them, we won't do anything."" Meanwhile, Russia continued to be accused of failing to fulfil these agreements. This is simply nonsense, the theatre of the absurd: the white is called black and the black is called white. It has been getting worse lately. Suddenly, there has been renewed talk about admitting Ukraine to NATO. Actually, it has been on for a long time, but has intensified lately. Do you understand what this could lead to or even can still lead to? If Ukraine is a NATO country, then in accordance with the North Atlantic Treaty, all other members must support that country in the event of a military conflict. No one is recognising Crimea as a part of Russia, except for you and me. They carry out military operations in Donbass, and they will also move into Crimea, and we will have to fight with the entire NATO organisation. Do you see what that means? Are the consequences clear enough? I think that everyone understands. Now they are talking about gaining a nuclear status, that is, acquiring nuclear weapons. We cannot ignore such things either, especially because we know how the so-called West acts with regard to Russia. First, Ukraine has had nuclear competencies since the Soviet times. As far as enrichment and nuclear materials are concerned, they are capable of launching such projects. They have missile competencies. Suffice it to mention Yuzhmash– it created intercontinental ballistic missile equipment for the Soviet Union. They can boost it and do it. And they will also receive help with that from across the ocean. And then they will say that we do not recognise their nuclear status, that they did it themselves, and they will put these systems under control, and from that moment, from that very second, Russia's future will change dramatically. From then on, our strategic adversaries would not even need to have intercontinental ballistic missiles. They would be able to keep us at the nuclear gunpoint, and that would be it. But how can we let this go unnoticed? These are absolutely real threats, not some far-fetched nonsense. And our young men who are fighting there now are giving their lives, they are giving their lives to fight for our future, for the future of our children. This is a completely obvious thing. People who do not want to understand this, especially among today's leadership, must understand that if they continue to do what they are doing– I have already said this too– they will call into question the very future of Ukrainian statehood. And if this happens, it will be entirely on them. What is happening now? I have already spoken about the goals we have identified. The first is to protect the people who live in Donbass, of course. How? By demilitarising and denazifying Ukraine and giving it a neutral status. Why? Because a neutral country will not be planning on joining NATO. Right now, their Constitution says they are planning to join NATO. You understand, they included this in the Constitution. What is meant by denazification? I have spoken with my Western colleagues about this:""So what? You also have radical nationalists."" Yes, we do, but we do not have people with extreme views in the Government. And everyone admits that they have them. Yes, maybe we have some idiots who are running around with the swastika, but do we support this at the government level? Do we have thousands of people parading with torches in Moscow or in our other regional capitals, with the swastika and with torches, like in the 1930s in Germany? Do we have this? But they do, and they support it. Do we support those who killed Russians, Jews, and Poles during the war? Do we hail them as heroes? But they do. What is happening now is also very important. Look, foreign citizens have been taken hostage in Sumy and Kharkov– over 6,000 young people, students. They were driven to a railway station and have been kept there for three days. We told everyone about this and sent this information to the current leadership of Ukraine.""Yes, yes, of course, we will deal with it now."" We informed the leaders of major European countries about this. I spoke to them personally.""Yes, yes, we will influence them right now."" We told the UN Secretary-General about this:""Yes, yes, we will settle this problem now."" But nobody is doing anything about it. They treat even worse those people whom they consider their own citizens. They are simply using them as a human shield. This is taking place in Mariupol now as we are talking with you. They called us from the government, from Kiev and spoke with our military:""Provide humanitarian corridors so that people can leave."" Of course, our people responded instantly and even suspended hostilities. They looked at what was happening. Nobody was allowed out. Do you understand what they are doing? They do not let anyone leave but are using people as a human shield. Who are they? The neo-Nazis, of course. We note the presence of militants from the Middle East and some European countries there. We know about them, we hear them in the air. They are using so-called Jihad mobiles– they stuff cars with explosives and drive them towards the troops. But they fail to achieve anything and they won't reach their aims. Who are they if not neo-Nazis? It is by these actions that they are destroying their own country and their statehood. Therefore, one of our key demands is demilitarisation. In other words, we are helping people, residents of Donbass to achieve a neutral status and demilitarisation of the country because we must understand clearly what weapons are there, where they are deployed and who controls them. Different options are possible here. We are discussing them now, in particular, with representatives of the Kiev government during the talks in Belarus. We are grateful to President Lukashenko for organising this work and helping us conduct them. Our proposals are on the negotiating table. We hope a group of negotiators from Kiev will respond positively to them. This is more or less what I wanted to say. Let's go on. Yulia Shvidkaya: Yulia Shvidkaya, co-pilot with Aeroflot Airlines. Good afternoon, Mr President. I have a question about the current situation. The thing is that there are so many rumours about the possibility of martial law, the enlistment of volunteers, the call-up of reservists, and that the new conscripts will be sent to Ukraine. Can you tell us precisely if martial law will be declared and if conscripts will be sent to Ukraine? Vladimir Putin: Much of what is taking place now, of what we can see and what we come up against are methods of fighting Russia. Incidentally, the sanctions that are imposed on us are like a war. Thankfully, it has not got to that yet. I think that our so-called partners understand what this can lead to and how much is at stake, despite their reckless statements, for example, like the statement made by the UK Foreign Secretary, when she blurted out that NATO could get involved in the conflict. And we immediately had to take a decision to put our deterrence forces on high alert. Their reaction was instantaneous: they said that it was a misunderstanding. But nobody rebuffed her(the UK Foreign Secretary is a woman), and nobody has disavowed those statements. They could have told us something like,""You know, it's her personal opinion, take no notice."" But nobody uttered a single word! What should we think about this? How should we regard it? Of course, we took that statement as a warning and acted accordingly. And now I will answer your question about volunteers, conscripts, martial law and the like. Under the law, martial law is declared by a Presidential executive order, which should be approved by the Federation Council, in case of foreign aggression, in particular, in the zones of hostilities. This is not the case now, and I hope it will not come to that. This is the first point. Second, about the state of alert. There are several options: martial law or the state of alert, which is also declared by a presidential executive order and approved by the Federation Council in case of large-scale internal threats. There is also the state of emergency. It is usually declared in a specific region or throughout the country in the event of manmade disasters, natural disasters, etc. Thankfully, this is not the case either. We are not planning to declare a state of alert on the territory of the Russian Federation. There are no such plans and no necessity for this now. Yes, we see that attempts are being made to stir up our society. Incidentally, this is further proof of what I have said– that we are dealing not with ordinary radicals but with neo-Nazis. Our people can freely express their opinions of what they like or do not like about our actions in Ukraine. But in Ukraine those who express views such as members of the so-called liberal part of our society do are grabbed on the street and shot. We have proof of that. Our security services are collecting this information and will provide it later on. They are simply shot dead. In our country, some of our liberal intellectuals hold protest rallies, but those who say similar things about Russia in Ukraine are simply executed straightaway, without charge or trial. Now, about the martial law. To reiterate, it is usually imposed in case of an external aggression, a military threat. I hope this will not happen, despite irresponsible statements by certain officials. We are hearing voices that a no-fly zone should be imposed over Ukraine. It is impossible to do this in Ukraine. It can only be done from the territory of neighbouring states. However, we will consider any move in this direction as participation in the armed conflict of the country from whoseterritory a threat to our servicemen is created. We will consider them participants in hostilities that very second. Their membership in any organisation will not matter then. So, I hope the understanding of this is there and it will not come to this, either. Only professional servicemen– officers and contract soldiers– are taking part in this operation. There are no conscripts, and we are not planning to get them involved. To reiterate, only men who made a very responsible voluntary choice to take part in this operation and to defend their Motherland are participating in this operation. They are carrying out this mission honourably. In my answer to your first question, I provided the reason why this is so and why we are entitled to say this. The same applies to those who are called up to the training camps. We do not plan to do this with this category, either. They are regularly called up to training camps. They were called up before and they will be called up afterwards. But we are not going to have this category participate in this conflict, in this operation. We have enough forces and means to address the tasks that we have set for ourselves with the use of the professional army. By the way, speaking of the operation itself I know there are many speculations about it. Frankly, I have no time to get into that, but they report to me that there is much chitchat about what is going on. All analysts are seeing what is happening, so I will not reveal any secret to you. We could have acted in a variety of ways. We could simply(by the way, this answers your question, in part) help the republics of Donbass right on the line of contact, at the frontline, so to say, and simply reinforce them with our army. But in this case, the other side, I mean reckless support for nationalists and radicals coming from the West, would have provided endless support with the material resources, ammunition, equipment, and so on. Therefore, our General Staff and the Defence Ministry took a different road. The first thing they did was destroy all the military infrastructure. Not completely but most of it: arms and ammunition depots, aircraft and air defence systems. Destroying air defence systems takes some time(you are civilians, yet you are connected with aviation)– they must be identified and then hit. This work has been practically finished. Hence the demand to impose a no-fly zone. However, doing so would have tremendous and disastrous consequences not only for Europe but also globally. I think those on the other side who are not completely at sea understand that. That is why we chose that road, and it turned out to be absolutely correct. Our servicemen are working without haste and are doing everything to ensure the safety of civilians. Unfortunately, those bandits, neo-Nazis do not spare people. They shoot dead even their own service personnel who do not want to offer armed resistance. We know about such facts, too. Nationalists, Banderites, neo-Nazis– it is hard to call them anything else– shoot their own servicemen. These nationalists were put in nearly every military unit, up to several dozen in each, and they act in exactly that cruel way. But I repeat that we are not engaging and are not going to engage conscripts or reservists in this military operation. I presume that our army will fulfil all the tasks it is facing, and I do not have the slightest doubt about that. The very course of the operation proves that. It is going according to schedule, and everything is being done according to the General Staff's plan. As for volunteers and those young people who come to military recruiting stations, we are grateful to them for this patriotic impulse and the desire to support the country and the Armed Forces. The very fact of their coming does matters, for sure. However, their assistance is not needed for now, and I believe it will not be needed. I am turning to the cameras so that they will see and hear me say,""Thank you."" Let us proceed. Kristina Shaposhnikova: Good afternoon, Mr President, Kristina Shaposhnikova, Aeroflot Airbus A320 pilot. This question may be of concern to many people: given the economic circumstances, are any measures being taken or planned to support families and socially vulnerable groups, as well as public-sector employees? Probably, many are also interested in whether the private sector will receive any support, since it provides employment and pays salaries. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: First, we will adjust the social benefits as planned. Pensions and all social benefits will be adjusted. With regard to the private sector, given the current circumstances, I believe the only way forward is to provide maximum economic freedom to those in business. We have adopted several decisions in this respect, and the Government is working to expand the list of these support measures. It also includes lifting various restrictions on entrepreneurial activities, in part concerning liberalisation of criminal legislation. For example, I support the idea– as a matter of fact, this decision has already been adopted– of removing the threat of criminal prosecution for economic crimes, especially if the damage has been paid for. This is my first point. Second, with regard to tax crimes, indeed, breaking the law is unacceptable, but we agreed that criminal cases in this respect can only be initiated based on materials submitted by the taxation service. We will certainly do this, and we will go down this path. This is extremely important for people in business. People are aware of it. Frankly, the private sector has been raising these questions for a long time now. I think they will appreciate it accordingly when they hear it. You had a second question. I jotted it down, but my notes are illegible. Kristina Shaposhnikova: The question was about supporting families. Vladimir Putin: Look, we have developed an entire system to support families, especially families with children. We pay benefits for infants to 18 months, then from 18 months to 3 years, and from 3 to 7 years, as well as expectant mothers. Pregnant women facing financial hardship are also supported. Also, support is provided to families with children and single-parent families with children from 8 to 18. Our goal is to develop a single system. Some regions provide support for children 8 to 18, others do not. A federal system is not available yet, either. Our goal is to develop a unified, clear and harmonious support system for expectant mothers and all children under 18 years of age. We have drafted a plan to do this. Trust me, I discussed this matter with the Government– the social bloc, the Finance Ministry and the Executive Office– this morning. Appropriate measures are being developed– I do not want to get ahead of myself– but I will announce our next steps in building this coordinated system soon. We will definitely go down this road and put in place a system for supporting families from pregnancy and the birth of a baby to 18 years of age. We will announce the decisions and the steps to be taken along this path soon. Kristina Shaposhnikova: Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Go ahead, please. Viktoria Karptsova: Good afternoon, Mr President. My name is Viktoria Karptsova. I am a flight attendant with Aeroflot Airlines. Here is the question I wanted to ask you. The aviation industry has been facing challenges ever since the onset of the pandemic around the world. The number of flights decreased, but in early 2022 there was hope that we would be flying as much as we used to. However, one country after another has closed its airspace to Russian carriers, as we have been learning from the news. Of course, this is a double-edged sword. For example, how can people now fly from London to Tokyo? What a complex issue. Of course, this happened before, back in the Soviet days. However, I wanted to know how long you believe this situation will last? Vladimir Putin: You see, Viktoria, this does not depend just on us. This depends on those who are doing this. They are hurting themselves. I do not think that they like what they are doing. Their authorities are exerting political pressure on them to take these actions. Without the trans-Siberian overflights you are referring to, they will have to fly around Siberia, since we are closing our air space to them, meaning that they will need more time to reach their destinations, spend more fuel, which in turn will drive up airfares, and so forth. I proceed from the premise that this sector will evolve with the overall situation. As for the pandemic you mentioned, domestic air traffic decreased by 88 percent during the pandemic, while foreign flights were down by 90 percent, with almost all flights cancelled. Overall, we have some experience in dealing with situations like this. That said, last year domestic passenger traffic increased 20 percent compared to the pre-pandemic level. I may not have the exact numbers, but I think passenger traffic reached 87.5 million, which is 20 percent higher than pre-pandemic. What will we do now? Of course, we will seek to increase domestic traffic. We will operate foreign destinations where they remain open, and we will try to change the situation. You know, there is of course a negative side to all this, since it creates inconveniences for passengers. Still, there are also advantages in terms of infrastructure development here at home. We will develop the domestic aviation industry, build our own aircraft, including the MC-21, the Il-114–300, Baikal, etc. We will keep developing our airfields and airports. There is an entire programme for developing the airfield network. I think it includes 57 airfields and 60 various initiatives. What are they? They deal with improving infrastructure in all its aspects, building new runways and so forth. This is what improving the""country's territorial connectivity"" is all about. There is a lot to be done, but this will be yet another development driver, including in terms of industrial and infrastructure development, just as we created an impetus to develop the agricultural sector some time ago. I think last year we made US$25 billion from agricultural exports. This seemed impossible only a short while ago, but we did it. This is not just about the volume of these exports. We have been able to fully cover the country's needs in terms of staple food. In this regard, we can say that this was a blessing in disguise, as the saying goes. Make no mistake, we will do the same with aircraft manufacturing and passenger transport. Yulia Vasilevskaya: Good afternoon, Mr President. Yulia Vasilevskaya, Aeroflot pilot. I will start by mentioning the widely popular MC-21 aircraft. It is definitely good, and not in the least inferior to foreign analogues in terms of technical or any other properties. At the same time, the company will not be able to replace Boeing and Airbus overnight. As an Airbus pilot, I am worried about the future of our fleet. In this regard, I have the following question: how will the aviation industry be operating in the near future when leasing companies want to take our aircraft? I am also concerned about the procurement of important spare parts for the timely maintenance and repair of aircraft in our fleet. Thanks. Vladimir Putin: First, there is something I need to establish. You noted that the MC-21 is not inferior to its Western counterparts. It is better in many respects, really better: it has a wider body, more space for middle seat, there is more space for luggage compartments– it is definitely better. By the way, over the past few years, I believe our competitors, including American ones, have made some really unscrupulous moves. They actually included certain materials– which have nothing to do with the defence industry, they are formally double-purpose, but they have never been used for any double purpose– they included some of those materials on their sanctions lists. Why? Because they had their own products, their aircraft that were clearly inferior to the MC-21 in competitive terms. We ended up making what they tried to strip us of– we invented our own innovative materials, and they are even better than foreign-made ones. Unfortunately, this led to a slight shift to the right, as they say referring to schedules, that is, our country was behind by about twelve to eighteen months in this respect. But we did it. We will do the same in other areas. You know the saying: they won't lock the barn door till after the horse is stolen. This is definitely about us. When we are cornered, we start sweating and achieve what we need to. It was the same with the M-C21. It has a PD-14 engine. Not only is it not inferior[to foreign ones], but it is actually better in many respects. Yes, it will take some more time, a few months, and the aircraft will be propelled by Russian-made engines, and it will be cutting-edge and fully Russian-made. Leasing companies and spare parts– I am not going to go into detail right now, but your former CEO, now Minister of Transport, has some ideas, and he reports them to me regularly, calls me almost every morning. On the whole, I support these considerations. Let's give him the opportunity to negotiate with his partners. I hope they will agree on things that overlap with their own interests. But I am certain that we will fly. Yulia Vasilevskaya: Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Do you want to add anything? Go ahead, please. Natalya Gorbunova: Natalya Gorbunova, Aeroflot flight attendant. Mr President, now, in this situation, we would really like to help both the country and our industry. We must have more domestic flights. Can you please tell us about the development of regional aviation in the next few years? Vladimir Putin: You know, and I have already mentioned, that one of our priority goals is to create territorial connections inside the country in several areas. First, this includes domestic airliners starting with the L-410; Il-114–300 with 60 or, I think, 62 seats, and the MC-21. Masha and I have just been to the Sukhoi Superjet-100 cockpit simulator. We will develop all of these. If domestic sourcing for some of them is not complete we will achieve it by any means. This is the first point. The second component is airports. After all, to fly it is necessary to take off and land. So, we have an extensive programme in this respect and it is underway. By the way, a dozen projects have already been finished, such as modernisation and construction of new runways. We will implement this programme and go further along this road. A third point– we will, of course, continue subsidising some flights. This includes the Far East and the company operating there– Aurora. This year we have increased subsidies on these routes by five times to 6 billion rubles and will increase it further, if necessary. So, we will try to avoid situations where people have to fly from one small town to another via Moscow. This is our number one goal. We will work on this consistently, but without haste, and we will certainly resolve it. Anything else? Go ahead, please. Galina Kairova: Good afternoon, Mr President. I am Galina Kairova, an Aeroflot flight training pilot. All of us were strongly affected by the pandemic. But our aviation has withstood this test and last year domestic air flights even exceeded 2019 levels. Vladimir Putin: Yes, I said that. Galina Kairova: And, this was partly due to state support. Vladimir Putin: Plus 20 percent Galina Kairova: Yes, this is a lot and enough. What can we expect now? What should we do next? And how will the state support our industry? Vladimir Putin: We are starting to go around in circles a bit. I basically already replied to this but will say it again. I have just talked about subsidising these flights, including to the Far East and other areas. We will increase this support and we have already increased it five-fold. We will develop transport infrastructure and manufacture our own aircraft. And, of course we will do all we can to have proper connections between the regions in our country so our people can see it. It is not just our people that need this, although it is a priority for the economy. This is not just about the transport business but it also concerns the businesspeople you were worried about. It is important to depart and arrive on time. I know when major projects are discussed, specialists always want to know whether they can quickly get to their destination and quickly make it back to Moscow, St Petersburg, Kazan or other large cities to resolve some business issues or simply return to their families if they were in the North. So, we will move forward in all of these directions. I would like to wish you a happy holiday once again and wish you all the best. Thank you for such a warm reception."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67907,Telephone conversation with Federal Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz,2022-03-04T18:45:00Z,NA,Vladimir Putin had a telephone conversation with Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany Olaf Scholz at the German side's initiative.,"The parties continued to discuss the developments in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin laid out Russia's principled approaches in the context of the special military operation to protect the residents of Donbass, explaining in detail its objectives that will be achieved without fail. Olaf Scholtz expressed concern over the active hostilities and reports of the sides' civilian and military casualties. Vladimir Putin recalled that for eight years, the Western partners shut their eyes to the genocide of people of the Donbass republics perpetrated by the Kiev regime. About 14,000 people, including thousands of children, died as a result. During the special operation, the Russian military are doing all they can to protect civilian lives. Reports of shelling in Kiev and other big cities are crudely fabricated propaganda. It was emphasised that the main threat is posed by neo-Nazi military units that are committing numerous war crimes. They are using terrorist methods by deploying strike weapons in residential areas and cynically using civilians as cover. The Kiev authorities continue to break their promise to stop the barbarity – the number of such cases has been on the rise in the past few days. We are increasingly documenting the appearance of mercenaries from third countries, including Albania and Croatia, militants from Kosovo and even jihadists with experience in combat in Syria. In addition, over 6,000 foreign citizens, mostly students, have essentially been taken hostage and are being used by radicals as the human shield. Attempts to leave the districts controlled by Ukrainian forces are stopped at gunpoint. One recent case that cannot be ignored is the shelling of a foreign student dormitory by the neo-Nazis in the city of Sumy. Some students were wounded. The collective West prefers to ignore such violations of international humanitarian law, and so the President of Russia urged Olaf Scholz to compel the Kiev authorities to release foreign citizens as soon as possible and organise their safe evacuation. Vladimir Putin reaffirmed that Russia is open to dialogue with Ukraine as well as all those in Ukraine who want peace, but on the condition that all Russian demands are met. These include a neutral and nuclear-free status for Ukraine, mandatory demilitarisation and denazification of the Ukrainian state, recognition of Russia's sovereignty over Crimea and the sovereignty of the DPR and the LPR within the borders of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions. The hope was expressed that representatives of Kiev will take a reasonable and constructive position at the planned third round of talks. The President of Russia and the Chancellor of Germany will continue their contacts. "

The first railway cars will be rolled onto the ferry on March 4, after which it will operate on the Ust-Luga – Baltiysk line. Using eco-friendly fuel on the ferry will reduce CO2 emissions by 20 to 30 percent compared to similar ships running on traditional heavy fuel, as well as achieve a more than 90 percent reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions and eliminate sulphur oxide and soot emissions altogether. The flag-raising ceremony took place on the car and auto ferry complex at Ust-Luga, a seaport in the Leningrad Region. Taking part in the ceremony, also by videoconference from Moscow, were Minister of Transport Vitaly Savelyev and Russian Railways CEO – Chairman of the Executive Board Oleg Belozerov, while Governor of the Leningrad Region Alexander Drozdenko, General Director of Rosmorport Sergei Pylin and his deputy for fleet management Vasily Strugov, as well as the ferry's captain Alexander Vangonen joined the event via videoconference from the Leningrad Region, and Governor of the Kaliningrad Region Anton Alikhanov participated from the Kaliningrad Region. * * * Speech at the flag-raising ceremony President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, good afternoon, I am glad to see all of you. In just a few minutes, Russia's state flag will be raised above the new car and auto ferry, named in honour of our great military commander, two-time Hero of the Soviet Union Konstantin Rokossovsky. Already today, this state-of-the-art vessel will sail off to the Kaliningrad Region carrying essential goods for its residents, as well as construction materials and other cargo for the key sectors of the region's economy. The overall shipments between Ust-Luga and Baltiysk will increase more than 1.5-fold to two million tonnes per year. The new ferry will be able to navigate the high seas even in the most challenging weather conditions and sail the winter seas without being accompanied by an icebreaker. Thanks to the maritime transport of this class, we can guarantee strong reliable connections between Russia's western outposts and the rest of the country. This means that, no matter what happens, we can ensure decent living conditions for people, opportunities for further improvement of the industrial, social and tourist infrastructure in the Kaliningrad Region, for uninterrupted supplies and the continuous operation of companies and facilities in the region. I want to thank all those who participated in this extremely important transport project, for their hard work. Resources of the state and the potential of Russia's leading companies and research institutions that offered advanced technical solutions, including eco-friendly solutions, were focused on this project. This ferry can operate on LNG or diesel fuel but with high environmental parameters, which should reduce hazardous emissions by more than 90 percent and protect the environment and the waters of the Baltic Sea. The General Chernyakhovsky ferry, which is currently under construction, also has similar modern characteristics. The Marshal Vasilevsky tanker with gas liquefaction equipment that will provide an autonomous gas supply to Russia's western outpost, if necessary, is already anchored in the port of Kaliningrad. It is symbolic that these modern and technology-intensive vessels are named after our outstanding military commanders who liberated our country and the rest of the world from Nazism. For these truly courageous people and true patriots, the independence and sovereignty of our Fatherland mattered more than anything else. They saved and protected our country, showing us, future generations, that we must be strong and keep moving forwards. No matter how hard and difficult it may be, we will continue our development. We will improve the transport and logistics infrastructure across the entire country and, of course, in the Baltics, on our Arctic territories and the Russian Far East, including the construction of new modern ferries for Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands. I am certain that our companies, design and engineering bureaux will be able to fulfil these tasks. Now I want to pass the floor to Minister of Transport Vitaly Savelyev who will present a report. Mr Savelyev, please. Minister of Transport Vitaly Savelyev: Thank you. Mr President, colleagues, I am happy to salute you at the ceremony of raising the state flag of the Russian Federation on our new ferry, the Marshall Rokossovsky. The launch of a new ferry is a very important, symbolic event for us. The ferry can carry up to 80 carriages or 78 vehicles. Importantly, the speed of loading it will be four times faster than on existing ferries – as few as five hours instead of 20. As you have said, Mr President, this year we expect one more ferry of the same class to be completed, which will be named in honour of General Chernyakhovsky. Both ferries will operate on the Ust-Luga – Baltiysk line, thus making the Kaliningrad Region more accessible to transport. Indicatively, in the future, both ferries will be used in the autonomous ship navigation project. Marine transport is moving ahead in the wake of digitisation. All this is making the process of transport management more efficient. New ferries are yet another step in ensuring reliable transport access to our entire territory. We will continue to further develop marine transport. I wish success to all my colleagues. I am grateful for your attention. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Thank you, Mr Savelyev. Mr Alikhanov, Governor of the Kaliningrad Region. Go ahead, please. Kaliningrad Region Governor Anton Alikhanov: Mr President, colleagues, Mr President, I would like to thank you for the attention that you personally devote to issues related to the development of the Kaliningrad Region. As mentioned earlier, the ferry Marshall Rokossovsky is the first ferry built under the plan for ensuring transport access to the Kaliningrad Region. This plan is aimed at ensuring the transport security of our region. For our region, ferry transport is the only way of maintaining regular connections with the rest of the Russian Federation, which does not depend on the policy of adjacent states. The new ferry will substantially improve logistical access to our region under any possible restrictions on passage via the territory of adjacent states. It will remove the risks of the lack of alternative routes for the delivery of socially important and special cargo via the Baltic states. Mr President, I would like to once again thank you and our colleagues from the Government, who have worked actively on this project. And of course, we are looking forward to receiving the other new ferry. We are ready to load it with products made in our region for the needs of other regions in the Russian Federation. Thank you very much. I wish you a safe trip. Vladimir Putin: Mr Alikhanov, you have mentioned neighbouring countries. I would like to stress once again that we have – we have always said this – no evil intentions with regard to our neighbours. I would like to advise them not to foment tensions either and refrain from introducing restrictions. We fulfil and will continue to fulfil all our obligations, and we see no need to increase tensions or make our relations worse. All our actions, if they arise, are always taken solely in response to unfriendly actions with respect to the Russian Federation. I think everyone should give consideration to the need to normalise relations and cooperate in a normal way, to promote relations in a normal way. As for projects like this, they certainly increase logistical independence, and we will continue working on this. Please, I see that this event is being attended by Mr Belozerov, CEO of Russian Railways, our leading company. Mr Belozerov, if you have something to add to what has been said by our colleagues, please do. General Director and Chairman of the Executive Board of Russian Railways Oleg Belozerov: Thank you very much. Mr President, colleagues, The raising of the Russian Federation state flag on the Marshal Rokossovsky ferry and the commissioning of the ferry is a new qualitative step in the development of the mixed railway-ferry service. Jointly with the sailors, we are confidently progressing towards the implementation of the plans to ensure our country's full transport connectivity. In the two months since the start of 2021, the railway-ferry service has grown by one-quarter and we expect a strong increase in the future. In addition to advanced seaworthiness, the new ferry will create additional opportunities for cutting costs and implementing technological operations. We have always focused on ensuring the reliability and stability of the railway-ferry service and will do so in the future. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Leningrad Region Governor Drozdenko, please go ahead. One of the points, the point where we are now, the port of Ust-Luga, is located in the Leningrad Region. Please go ahead. Governor of the Leningrad Region Alexander Drozdenko: Mr President, colleagues, For us, the Leningrad Region, it is a great honour to have the Rosmorport-commissioned Marshal Rokossovsky ferry, which is Russia's first dual-fuel road and rail ferry, and which was built at the Nevsky Shipyard in St Petersburg. This shows that we can build modern sea vessels and sea ferries. Another ferry, Army General Ivan Chernyakhovsky, is under construction. These ferries will be instrumental in connecting the Leningrad Region, Russia and Kaliningrad. They will provide a reliable transport link. Good luck. Vladimir Putin: Mr Drozdenko, we have discussed this issue with you before. Today, I discussed it with the President of Belarus. Our Belarusian friends are interested in having a presence in the Baltic Sea area and are interested in developing their own port facilities. As you are aware, I support this project, and I asked you to come up with whatever assistance you can provide. This would be various locations, points and structures where our Belarusian friends can pursue these projects. I will not go into detail now as the alternatives vary, and you are aware of this. I would like to revisit this issue later, and I want you to support these plans. They are important for Belarus, and for us as well, because they involve the expansion of our infrastructure, the development of our coastal areas, and an increase in cargo volume for our country. Accordingly, the benefits derived by Belarus will largely overflow into our economy. We are interested in promoting this project, so I want you to support these undertakings. But this is just a side note. And now I would like to give the floor to the captain of the Marshal Rokossovsky, Mr Vangonen. Please, Mr Vangonen. Captain of the Marshal Rokossovsky vessel Alexander Vangonen: Mr President of the Russian Federation, The ferry Marshal Rokossovsky has successfully completed its journey from the shipyard to its home port. At this time, the ship is fully ready to begin service on the Ust-Luga – Baltiysk line. I am asking for your permission to raise the state flag of the Russian Federation. Vladimir Putin: Permission granted to raise the state flag of the Russian Federation. Alexander Vangonen: Raise the national flag of the Russian Federation. (The Russian anthem plays.) The national flag of the Russian Federation has been raised. Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much, Mr Vangonen. Friends, I would like to say a few words to conclude this ceremony, the important event we are attending today. The national flag of Russia has been raised on the Marshal Rokossovsky ferry. I repeat, the ship has been engineered in our design bureaux using innovative domestic technology. True, it has been an international project that included many of our partners, including some of our foreign partners. We are aware of this, but the innovative solutions used are actually Russian. We have repeatedly shown and are ready to prove once again that if someone does not want to cooperate with us and they are prepared to harm themselves like this, they will, of course, harm us too, but how? We will just have to shift a few projects to the right a little, gain some additional competencies – just as we have for a number of other projects, for example, in aviation – but we will attain our goals nevertheless, we will solve our problems anyway. And what's more, we will even ultimately benefit from this because, as I said, we will acquire additional competencies. We are capable of solving such problems. This is how we must implement all our plans for social, economic and infrastructure development – based on the most advanced environmental and technological standards so that our projects and products contribute to high quality of life for the people and the national economy's resilience against external shock. As I have said, we will certainly resolve these problems. I would like to wish you all great successes, and to the crew of the Marshal Rokossovsky, successful work. Thank you all very much. Thank you."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67903,Meeting with Security Council permanent members,2022-03-03T19:50:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region",Vladimir Putin met via videoconference with permanent members of the Security Council.,"Taking part in the meeting were Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matviyenko, Speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin, Deputy Chair of the Security Council Dmitry Medvedev, Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Anton Vaino, Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev, Minister of the Interior Vladimir Kolokoltsev, Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov, Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu, Director of the Federal Security Service Alexander Bortnikov, Director of the Foreign Intelligence Service Sergei Naryshkin, and Special Representative of the President of the Russian Federation for Environmental Protection, Ecology and Transport Sergei Ivanov. * * *  President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrades, On February 24 we commenced the special military operation in Ukraine. In achieving its objectives of protecting our people in Donbass and providing for the security of our Motherland, Russian soldiers and officers are acting courageously, like true heroes. Our servicemen are fighting hard, fully understanding the righteousness of their cause. Soldiers and officers remain in position even after being wounded. They sacrifice themselves, their lives, to save their fellow soldiers and civilians. Our servicemen and Donbass militia are really displaying mass heroism. I would distinguish the personnel of the 100th Motorised Rifle Brigade fighting in the Donetsk area. Its servicemen under the command of Colonel Alexey Berngard breached the deeply fortified defenses in the Volnovakhi region that have been strengthened and equipped by the nationalists for almost eight years. Tank platoon commander Lieutenant of the Guards Viktor Sokolnik destroyed fived tanks in battle. On February 25, outside of Chuginka, company leader of the 163th armour regiment Captain Alexei Lyovkin came upon nationalist units including 15 tanks and six mechanized infantry combat vehicles. He and his personnel attacked the enemy and destroyed all the MICVs and five tanks, completing the mission without losses. I have signed an executive order on awarding the title of Hero of Russia to Lieutenant Nurmagomed Gadzhimagomedov, regrettably, posthumously. During a battle he confidently lead his soldiers, taking care of his subordinates as a good commander should. Even when he was seriously wounded, he continued fighting to his last breath, blowing up himself, along with the militants who surrounded him, with a grenade. He did that because he knew who he was dealing with – neo-Nazis who torture and brutally murder prisoners. I am a Russian. As they say, all my relatives are Ivans and Marias. But when I see heroes like this young man, Nurmagomed Gadzhimagomedov, a resident of Dagestan and an ethnic Lak, and our other soldiers, I can hardly stop myself from saying: I am a Lak, a Dagestani, a Chechen, an Ingush, a Russian, a Tatar, a Jew, a Mordovian, an Ossetian… It is impossible to name all of the more than 300 nationalities and ethnic groups that live in Russia. I think you can understand me. I am proud to be part of this world, part of our powerful and strong multinational people of Russia. At the same time, I will never abandon my conviction that Russians and Ukrainians are one nation, even though some people in Ukraine have been intimidated, many have been duped by nationalist Nazi propaganda, and some have consciously decided to become followers of Bandera and other Nazi accomplices, who fought on Hitler's side during the Great Patriotic War. It is a fact that we are fighting neo-Nazis, which can be seen from the course of the hostilities. The nationalist and neo-Nazi units – and there are foreign mercenaries in them, including from the Middle East – are using peaceful civilians as a human shield. As I have said, there is objective data and photos of how they deploy military equipment in residential districts. They are behaving like this, like outright criminals, and instead of honouring their promise to remove that equipment from residential neighbourhoods, kindergartens and hospitals, they are deploying more tanks, artillery guns and mortar launchers there. They have also taken foreign nationals hostage, including thousands of young people, students who were receiving an education in Ukraine. For example, they held 3,179 Indian citizens, most of them students, at the railway station in Kharkov for over a day. And they are still holding the majority of them, including 576 in Sumy. The neo-Nazis opened fire on the Chinese students who wanted to leave Kharkov, wounding two of them. As I have said, hundreds of foreign nationals are trying to leave the combat zones, but they are being prevented from doing so. In fact, they are being held hostage; the hostage-takers are playing for time or are offering them a chance to leave via Lviv or Poland, that is, to cross the combat zone, thereby risking their lives. Our service personnel have opened corridors in absolutely all conflict areas. They have offered transportation so peaceful civilians and foreign nationals can go to a safe place. I would like to point out again that the nationalists are preventing them from doing this. Moreover, they are telling foreign nationals to turn to their own authorities, which have to seek the assistance of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry. In fact, they are pushing these people into the line of fire. The nationalists are acting even worse towards their own citizens, their own people. As I said, they are using people as human shields. Our service personnel have reported instances where people in residential buildings in the Donetsk People's Republic – in Severodonetsk, Lisichansk and other towns – are forced to gather in the middle floors; the windows and walls in the lower floors are broken open to mount heavy weaponry such as cannons, and tanks, and machineguns, and snipers are placed on the roof and on the upper floors. It is only fascists that did this, they were the ones that treated civilians so inhumanely when Soviet forces were fighting them, including as they were liberating Ukraine. I would like to repeat that our soldiers and officers are trying to prevent civilian casualties, and regrettably, they are sustaining losses while doing this. It is our duty to support the families of our dead and wounded comrades, who fight for the security of our Fatherland, for our people, for the people of Russia. All family members of the servicemen who have perished during this special military operation in Ukraine will be issued a death gratuity and a one-time payment of 7,421,000 rubles. Monthly compensation will also be paid to each family member of the deceased. In addition, I consider it necessary to approve an additional payment of 5 million rubles to each family of Defence Ministry service members, and service members and other personnel of the other security agencies killed during the operation. Any service personnel wounded during the operation will be issued benefit payments as well. I am referring to insurance benefits and one-time payments for being wounded, injured or for receiving a concussion. Wounded contract service personnel found unfit for duty will be issued a one-time payment of 2,968,000 rubles, and a monthly payment in case of permanent disability. All these measures are provided for by law. At the same time, I believe that an additional payment of 3 million rubles should be stipulated for Defence Ministry service personnel and service members and other personnel of other security agencies who are wounded during the operation. I would like to emphasise once again that our men and officers are fighting in Ukraine for Russia, for a peaceful life for the citizens of Donbass, and for the denazification and demilitarisation of Ukraine, so that no anti-Russia, which the West has been creating for years right on our border, can threaten us, including with nuclear weapons, as has recently become the case. Our people are proud of their Armed Forces. We will never forget our comrades who have been killed in action. We will do everything necessary to support their families and children, to give them an education, to support their loved ones. Let us pay our respects to our soldiers who have died doing their military duty during this special military operation in Ukraine. (Minute of silence.) Comrades, I would like to say that the special military operation is proceeding on schedule and according to plan. All the tasks are being fulfilled. The Defence Minister will report in more detail on this. Mr Shoigu, please. <…>"

Russia and Saudi Arabia will continue to coordinate approaches within this format. Considering the anti-Russia sanctions introduced by a number of Western countries, Vladimir Putin emphasised that it is unacceptable to politicise issues related to global energy supply and outlined the Russian side's approaches in the context of the special military operation to protect Donbass. Mutual interest was expressed in further comprehensive development of the mutually beneficial Russian-Saudi partnership. The leaders agreed to maintain contacts at various levels. "

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67898,Telephone conversation with President of France Emmanuel Macron,2022-03-03T15:55:00Z,NA,Vladimir Putin had a telephone conversation with President of the French Republic Emmanuel Macron.,"The presidents continued their frank exchange of views on the situation regarding Ukraine. Vladimir Putin commented in detail on President Macron's Address to the Nation on the Ukraine War, which he delivered yesterday, disputing many of the points. Thus, Emmanuel Macron described Russia's statements about fighting Nazism in Ukraine as ""lies."" In this connection, the President of Russia provided a well-corroborated explanation regarding the neo-Nazis' substantial role in the state policy of Kiev. He pointed out that during the special operation to defend Donbass, Russia intends to continue its uncompromising struggle against the militants of the nationalist armed units, who are committing military crimes, including by deploying military equipment in residential areas and using civilians as human shields. The President of Russia noted that Emmanuel Macron had not mentioned in his address that the Ukrainian leadership had sabotaged the Minsk agreements for the past seven years, or that the Western countries, including France, had done absolutely nothing to make Kiev implement them. Moreover, they had closed their eyes to years of genocide against peaceful civilians in Donbass, which led to numerous casualties and forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek asylum in Russia. Vladimir Putin put forth the details of Russia's principled approach and terms in the context of talks with the representatives of Kiev. He reaffirmed that Russia's priority goals were demilitarisation and a neutral status for Ukraine, so that it would never pose a threat to the Russian Federation. It was emphasised that the goals of the special military operation would be attained in any case, and that any attempts to play for time by drawing out talks would only result in additional demands to Kiev being included in Russia's negotiating stance. Another point the President of Russia emphasised was that the Russian Armed Forces involved in the special operation, which is proceeding according to plan, are doing their utmost to save civilian lives. They are using precision weapons to destroy exclusively military infrastructure. The allegations about missile and bomb attacks on Kiev and other Ukrainian cities are untrue and are elements of the anti-Russia disinformation campaign. Vladimir Putin reaffirmed Russia's readiness for cooperation with its foreign partners to address acute humanitarian problems. He urged the President of France to join the efforts to ensure the safe evacuation of foreign nationals from Ukraine. He mentioned, for example, the large group of Indian students in Kharkov, whom the Ukrainian security services have taken hostage. Emmanuel Macron promised to take the issue up with the Kiev leadership. It was agreed to continue contacts at various levels on the issues raised during the conversation."

Naftali Bennett expressed a few considerations in this regard, taking into account his recent contacts with the leaders of several states. Vladimir Putin outlined the principled position of the Russian side regarding the conditions for resolving the conflict, including the unconditional consideration of Russia's security interests, the demilitarisation and denazification of the Ukrainian state, ensuring its neutral and non-nuclear status, as well as the recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea and the independence of the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics.

Vladimir Putin emphasised that the necessary instructions had been given and the Russian military is doing everything possible to ensure the safe evacuation of Indian citizens from the area of hostilities and their return home. Thus, Russian officials are trying to organise urgent evacuation of a group of Indian students from Kharkiv to Russia along the shortest route in the humanitarian corridor. Meanwhile, according to the latest information, these students have already been, in effect, taken hostage by the Ukrainian power agencies that are using them as a human shield and are doing everything to prevent their leaving for Russia. The Kiev authorities are fully responsible for this. The leaders agreed to continue close cooperation to ensure the safety of Indian citizens in Ukraine."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67882,Meeting with St Petersburg Governor Alexander Beglov,2022-03-01T13:50:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with Governor of St Petersburg Alexander Beglov.,"At the start of the meeting, the President noted a number of positive aspects in St Petersburg, including Russia's lowest unemployment rates and higher incomes, as compared to other regions. The gross regional product (GRP) continues to grow, and this is a good foundation for subsequent development. At the same time, Vladimir Putin suggested focusing on various matters that should be prioritised by municipal and federal authorities and discussing various problems. During the conversation, they touched upon healthcare, transport services and housing construction. Alexander Beglov discussed the construction of new hospitals during the pandemic. Later, they will be converted to treat regular patients. He also noted efforts to support primary care outpatient clinics and to provide medications, personal protective equipment and other essentials. The development of the city's transport system and that of the Leningrad Region are two inter-linked matters because both entities form one metropolitan area. According to the Governor, 950 up-to-date carriages will be purchased for the local metro system, and 339 new trams will start operating on various routes later this year and in 2023. Moreover, 389 new trolleybuses will be purchased during the same period. A large bus depot that can accommodate 400 buses fuelled with natural gas was upgraded. From July 15, 2,800 such buses will start operating in the city. Next year, the city will also launch construction of a depot for 400 electric buses. Mr Beglov also discussed the reform of the local construction sector that, among other things, aims to overcome the tremendous disproportion between social and housing infrastructure. A newly-approved resolution notes that residential buildings will be open for occupancy only if social facilities are simultaneously built and commissioned in accordance with current standards. Vladimir Putin noted that it was correct to address the issue in this manner, but that additional work had to be done, although the per-capita availability of local social facilities exceeded that in many other Russian regions. This position should not be lost, the President stressed, the situation should only get better in the future, and decisions that have been approved will help bring about improvements."

Vladimir Putin emphasised that such settlement is possible only in case of unconditional consideration for Russia's legitimate interests in the sphere of security, including recognition of Russia's sovereignty over Crimea, achieving the objectives of the Ukrainian state's demilitarisation and denazification, and ensuring its neutral status. It was noted that Russia is open to negotiations with representatives of Ukraine with the hope that they produce the desired results. The President of Russia made a point of noting that the Russian Armed Forces do not threaten civilians and do not target civilian facilities.

Mr Mishustin and I have discussed this topic ahead of this meeting, having in view, of course, also the sanctions that the so-called Western community – the ""empire of lies"" as I have referred to it in my remarks – is trying to implement against our country.

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67877,The President inspected the progress of construction of a National Space Centre in Moscow,2022-02-27T18:00:00Z,Moscow,"Vladimir Putin visited the Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Centre, which is currently undergoing massive reorganisation, involving, in particular, the construction of the National Space Centre complex.","The reorganisation project is being carried out by the Moscow City Government and the State Corporation Roscosmos at the instruction of the President. As a result, a unique research and production, engineering and educational cluster for the space and related industries will be created in the Filevskaya water meadow that will employ over 50,000 highly qualified engineers, scientists, researchers and specialists. The National Space Centre will be the centrepiece of the renovated area. Its construction will make it possible to pool together several key space industry organisations in one location– the central office and situation centre of the State Corporation Roscosmos, sectoral institutes, and other enterprises, which are currently scattered around Moscow. The National Space Centre will also incorporate a modern educational complex, youth design bureaus, a business support centre, exhibition pavilions and a centre for diversifying production. In addition to the construction of the National Space Centre, the project envisages the preservation of the Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Centre's manufacturing complex as well as a new research and production cluster of the Technopolis Moscow special economic zone. A part of the territory will be set aside for the construction of social facilities and residential buildings for the relocation of city residents as part of the housing renovation programme. At present, 800 people are engaged in works at the facility. The construction is to be completed in 2023.*** President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, hello, Remark: Hello. Vladimir Putin: To be honest, I did not expect to see such a strong team here. Just recently, Mr Sobyanin told me in detail about the plans we have here, which benefit both the city and the rocket and space industry of Russia. These are indeed grand plans and are momentous for the entire country, not just the rocket and space industry. I decided to visit the site to see what it looks like and in what condition it is today. I can say upfront that obviously many people are envious of those who work here as this construction site is really very important and grandiose. Mr Sobyanin, go ahead, please. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin Sobyanin SergeiMoscow Mayor: Yes, Mr President, we have been working here continuously, without days-off. There are between 600 and 800 workers at the construction site. We have discussed this project with you. I asked you to come and have a look, because, in my view, this is one of the most important facilities in the country. It is long since Russia launched such a large-scale undertaking, creating, on a single site, a scientific, educational, research and production cluster in the area of high technology, the most advanced technology, and the space industry. This facility– 255,000 square metres of useful space alone– is giant, immense. But this is far from all. Nearby, there is the Khrunichev plant occupying an area of 50 hectares. The plant continues operating; Mr Rogozin will probably tell you about this. In the vicinity, another 100 hectares is reserved for construction: we will build Moscow's biggest science and technology park, which will be included in a special economic zone and serve as a natural extension of this entire cluster, a hub for scientific, educational, research, and production technologies and organisations. You issued an instruction to build this facility in 2019. In late 2020, we started working on the site, and in 2021, we launched the construction project. As of today, two-thirds of the concreting operations have been completed. Before the end of this year, the high-rise part– the most difficult element that has required considerable preparatory and design work– will also be cast in concrete. The in-situ concrete works will also be completed. It is a huge tower: 288 metres. I hope that by the end of 2023, this entire complex will be handed over to Roscosmos for it to install equipment, furniture, and communications, and start working. There are jobs for 12,000 people; the Khrunichev plant, nearby, has a workforce of 8,000; and the technology park I have mentioned will employ about 30,000 people. In total, 50,000 people, which is a powerful core to create high technologies and industries. Vladimir Putin: So, it amounts to less than two years counting from this moment. Sergei Sobyanin: Yes. In real terms, the construction on this site will take eighteen months. Vladimir Putin: Mr Rogozin, go ahead, please. Director General of State Corporation Roscosmos Dmitry Rogozin Rogozin Dmitry: Mr President, I would like to say that we are very grateful to the Government of Moscow and Mr Sobyanin personally for this initiative. Sergei Sobyanin: We should thank Mr President, since he gave the instruction. You and I got together and discussed how to launch this site. These huge areas were just lying abandoned. Vladimir Putin: Yes, I understand. I remember our discussions. Sergei Sobyanin: Despite all problems, you instructed us to enter the site and start working. Vladimir Putin: I remember these discussions. Dmitry Rogozin: I would like to remind you that previously it was planned that all this land…that the plant would be relocated and the land would be used for development, and so on. You stopped this process. Vladimir Putin: Yes. Dmitry Rogozin: And then the decision was taken, which you approved. Vladimir Putin: Space industry old-timers also said that the whole thing should not be relocated to Siberia. Dmitry Rogozin: Yes, I want to confirm that 12,000 engineers and designers from 17 Roscosmos facilities in Moscow will be based here. Roscosmos has 50,000 staff in the Moscow Region in total, and 20,000 will be working here. This means that 12,000 will move here from other Moscow facilities, including engineers, designers, administrators and other workers. Another 8,000– literally behind you, there is a railway where we put together rocket trains that will go to space launch centres. There are two assembly and testing facilities. They are also undergoing modernisation. Currently, nine Proton rockets are there, fully assembled, and one Angara rocket that is undergoing comprehensive testing before being shipped to the space launch centre. So, yes, it is indeed a very important project for us. When we say""technology transfer,"" it often means that people simply network with each other and teams share ideas. I think, it will be very productive. One more thing that I want to stress, along with Mr Sobyanin, is that we are building a research and educational centre that will bring together all specialized departments of universities that provide us with specialists. They include Lomonosov Moscow State University, Bauman University, Moscow Aviation Institute and many others. Therefore, maintaining production facilities in Moscow, specialised departments to train specialists, and operating design bureaux, all put together, will create a powerful synergistic effect to push the development of the industry forward. Vladimir Putin: So, this complex will also provide professional training. Dmitry Rogozin: Yes, absolutely. Vladimir Putin: Excellent. I want to address everybody working here. Unfortunately, I cannot come closer and shake hands with you although I really wish I could. But I want to wish you all the best and success in completing this grand project. I would like to emphasise again that this project is important not only for the rocket and space industry and the city of Moscow. This facility will, without doubt, contribute to Moscow's technological advancement as yet another modern hi-tech centre but the entire country needs this project, considering the importance of the rocket and space industry and related sectors and their synergy. It is an extremely important area of our work. Thank you very much for doing this. I hope and I am certain that it is not our last construction project– and you will have projects to work on further. Thank you very much and good luck. I wish you all the best. Remark: Mr President. We support you, we stand by you. We support our guys. Hurrah! Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Our guys need your support, I assure you, and they will hear it. Thank you very much."

You have demonstrated many times that you are prepared to act with the utmost efficiency and under the harshest conditions to precisely and professionally complete the most difficult and demanding missions. You always perform your military duty to protect your native country and citizens with honour and protect Russia's national interests. The heroic traditions of the special forces find their roots in the centuries-long history of our army. They were fortified during the Great Patriotic War, matured and grew even stronger in Afghanistan and many hotbeds, as well as during the elimination of terrorists gangs both in the North Caucuses and in Syria. You know just how quickly the nature of present-day military conflict is transforming. Special Operations Forces soldiers and their commanders must constantly raise the bar of their professional and combat skills, hone their ability to handle cutting-edge weaponry and military hardware, and of course, keep up with advances in military science in order to always overtake any potential rival in all areas. I know that you undergo exactly this kind of training– comprehensive, all-encompassing and intensive, a real school of warfare. You strive to follow the best paragons of courage and bravery, true patriotism, and you set an example for new generations of defenders of the Fatherland and pass on your experience to young servicemen. I want to thank the command and the personnel of the Special Operations Forces as well as special forces veterans for their loyalty to the oath, for their impeccable service to the people of Russia and our great Motherland. My special appreciation goes to those who are performing their duty in the special operation to render assistance to the people's republics of Donbass. I wish you luck, success and all the very best to you and your loved ones."

Today, we will discuss the course of the special military operation in Ukraine. As expected, the Russian Army's main armed clashes are taking place not with regular Ukrainian armed forces' units but with nationalist groups that, as we know, bear direct responsibility for the genocide in Donbass and the spilled blood of the citizens of the people's republics. Besides, the nationalist elements that infiltrated regular Ukrainian armed forces' units are not only prompting them to armed resistance but are actually playing the role of anti-retreat units. Moreover, according to available information, and this is confirmed by objective monitoring – we are seeing this; Banderites and neo-Nazis are putting up heavy weapons, including multiple-rocket launchers, right in the central districts of large cities, including Kiev and Kharkov. They plan to force return fire by Russian strike systems against residential quarters. In effect, they are acting in the same way that terrorists act all over the world – using people as shields in the hope of accusing Russia of civilian casualties. It is known for a fact that all this is being done on the recommendations of foreign consultants, primarily American advisors. Once again, I am appealing to the military of the armed forces of Ukraine. Do not allow neo-Nazis and Banderites to use your children, wives and elders as a live shield. Take power into your own hands. It seems it will be easier for us to come to terms with you than with this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis that have settled in Kiev and that have taken the Ukrainian people hostage. I would also like to give the highest praise to the actions of Russian soldiers and officers. They are acting courageously, professionally and heroically, fulfilling their combat duty. They are resolving a vital task to ensure the security of our people and our homeland. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67846,Meeting with representatives of Russian business circles,2022-02-24T19:20:00Z,NA,Vladimir Putin had a meeting with representatives of Russian business community.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends, Good afternoon. Unfortunately, our meeting is taking place in unusual conditions, to put it mildly, but we planned it in advance. Of course, I would like to listen to Mr Shokhin who will tell us about his general considerations. President of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs(RSPP) Alexander Shokhin Shokhin AlexanderPresident of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs: Mr President, colleagues, Obviously, the current geopolitical situation is compelling Russian businesses to operate under difficult conditions, given the various restrictions. However, I would like to confirm that not only the state and the economy in general but also Russian businesses have learned to survive crisis situations. Since 2014, our businesses have learned to adapt to crisis phenomena and even to resolve development objectives. Incidentally, the COVID-19 pandemic has also provided additional instruments for companies and the Government and for our dialogue with the Government. We worked together to draft anti-crisis measures and systemic steps to improve the business and investment climate. We are well aware that any new sanctions will be much tougher than the previous restrictions and will affect many sectors: the financial sector, the extractive sectors, deliveries of technological equipment. They will affect certain types of raw materials and components and could upset supply chains, transport and logistics. Clearly, to dampen the effects of all these restrictions, Russian business, Russian companies will have to work even harder and more effectively to ensure continuing operations of their companies without job cuts, panic buying or price hikes. We will have to focus more on the import substitution strategy and look for new partners in the countries that are ready to cooperate. Of course, much will depend on the timely and successful performance of the Government. Importantly, it is necessary not only to hedge various risks and minimise the consequences of new rounds of sanctions for the country's development, but also to stick to the development agenda. We are not forgetting that we must think not only about today but also about tomorrow– you spoke about this in your opening remarks, Mr President. And so, I would like to make a number of points about possible decisions that, we believe, must be made right away. First, to the extent possible in the current situation, we would like to ensure predictable terms for implementing large investment projects. We are working on this issue in active dialogue with the Government. In part, we are completing the elaboration of a mechanism for agreements on protecting and encouraging investment. I think we will finish this work literally within a month's time. I am referring to the so-called formula approach. In some cases, when important parameters of the terms for implementing projects are subject to change, it is indeed necessary to use certain formulas. They do not guarantee stability of all current and future conditions but make them predictable when sanctions act as a trigger and affect inflation, the budget deficit and the ruble exchange rate. Mr President, we discussed this project with you at the December congress of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs and are now trying to formalise it with the Government, with Mr Andrei Belousov. Importantly, this approach may be applied to other elements of economic policy. Considering that sanctions may extend the time for implementing investment projects or delay their beginning, we suggest extending the most popular support tools and mechanisms, including corporate programmes for enhancing competitiveness, investment tax deduction and regional investment projects. This would certainly make the terms for implementing all planned corporate projects more predictable. Considering the sanctions imposed on the sovereign debt, it is necessary to think about additional incentives for private investors' demand for bonds. Let me recall that over 20 million broker accounts are open in Russia and the number of private investors on the Moscow exchange has exceeded 15 million. I am referring to individual investment accounts. Obviously, the potential domestic financial market, which has been making steady progress in the past few years, will be able to reduce the sting of sanction and create a new opportunity for working with the national debt. Another area of minimising external financial risks, which is also related to development, is the introduction of effective management of digital financial assets and crypto currencies. Legislation concerning digital financial assets is basically passed already. We have to fairly quickly introduce certain tax regimes that will not create incentives but rather lift some actually discriminatory conditions for the functioning of these assets as compared to other kinds of financial assets. As for crypto currency, we support the balanced approach by the Finance Ministry and the Government and suggest that a legislative foundation be drafted promptly for this sector to develop legally. We generally think it important to continue work and encourage the investment activities of private businesses, but this does not mean extra tax incentives as it is sometimes believed. It is about giving companies an opportunity to pursue their investment projects, including outside the framework of separate legal entities. In fact, it is about giving a clearer formal definition of""a holding company"" which Russian legislation lacks. We can also consider the possibility of lifting moratoriums on the development of consolidated groups of taxpayers. It obviously involves raising the quality of Russian corporate and tax legislation which can, firstly, increase the competitiveness of this legislation but the key is that it will make it possible to answer the question of how much Russian companies really invest, including with their dividends. You have set this task, and I would like our dialogue with the Finance Ministry and the Government to cover these components as well because currently many investment projects financed by dividends are not assessed as part of holding structures' overall investments. To conclude, I would like to say that we proceed from the fact that Russia is not closing down, it remains a part of the global economy, so we apparently are not turning away from international agreements on key cooperation issues, in particular, carbon and climate issues. I think our foreign partners should understand that climate projects are not an area where tough sanctions regimes can be applied because it really concerns the interests of the entire world. I think cooperation in many other areas will proceed in the same way, including international taxation rules. I generally think that we must do everything to show as clearly as possible that Russia remains a part of the global economy and will not provoke negative global events in world markets, including via response measures. I have no doubt that we will cope with any external risks and challenges. However, inside the country we must also act effectively and work not only on the agenda for today but also the agenda for tomorrow. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Here is what I would like to say. First, this is the main point, so that this is clear. What is happening is a forced measure. There were simply no chances left for taking a different course of action. The security risks that had been created were so high that it was impossible to respond by other means. All attempts had come to nothing. Frankly speaking, I am even surprised– there was not one iota of progress on any issue. I would like to emphasise again that this was a forced measure because risks could have created for us to the extent that it would have been impossible to conceive how our country could even exist in the future. This is the first point. Second, all of us, including you, understand the kind of world we live in, and we have been getting ready in certain ways for the restrictions and sanctions that are being imposed on us now. Nonetheless, what I am about to say is something that I consider extremely important. I would like to respond to what President of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Alexander Shokhin said. Russia remains part of the world economy, and to the extent that it remains part, we are not going to inflict damage on the system we feel ourselves to be a part of. We are not going to damage the system of the global economy that we are in, to the extent that we are in it. So, I think our partners should understand this and should not try to force us from this system. Nonetheless, restrictions will be imposed, even for political considerations. In this context, I would like to appeal to you to be understanding of what is going on and cooperate with the Government to find ways to support production, the economy and jobs, though bearing in mind how things are shaping up. I believe the goal of the Government and the authorities in general in the broadest sense of this word is, of course, to provide you with good conditions and ensure more freedom. There may be only one response– to ensure greater freedom of entrepreneurship, naturally, within a certain framework so that, as our colleagues put it, there is a certain amount of predictability from the Government but we expect predictability from businesses as well. Obviously, we cannot predict all geopolitical risks but in relations between businesses and the Government, you certainly have the right to expect clear and consistent predictability from the Government. And, the most important point, it is necessary to be in touch at all times, to respond in a nuanced way to everything that is happening and to adjust our joint work whenever necessary. I would like to thank you for what has been done up to now, even in these rather complicated conditions, and I hope that in the new conditions– although we cannot call them entirely new– but anyway at this stage we will work with the same solidarity and no less effectively. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67843,Address by the President of the Russian Federation,2022-02-24T06:00:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Citizens of Russia, friends, I consider it necessary today to speak again about the tragic events in Donbass and the key aspects of ensuring the security of Russia. I will begin with what I said in my address on February 21, 2022. I spoke about our biggest concerns and worries, and about the fundamental threats which irresponsible Western politicians created for Russia consistently, rudely and unceremoniously from year to year. I am referring to the eastward expansion of NATO, which is moving its military infrastructure ever closer to the Russian border. It is a fact that over the past 30 years we have been patiently trying to come to an agreement with the leading NATO countries regarding the principles of equal and indivisible security in Europe. In response to our proposals, we invariably faced either cynical deception and lies or attempts at pressure and blackmail, while the North Atlantic alliance continued to expand despite our protests and concerns. Its military machine is moving and, as I said, is approaching our very border. Why is this happening? Where did this insolent manner of talking down from the height of their exceptionalism, infallibility and all-permissiveness come from? What is the explanation for this contemptuous and disdainful attitude to our interests and absolutely legitimate demands? The answer is simple. Everything is clear and obvious. In the late 1980s, the Soviet Union grew weaker and subsequently broke apart. That experience should serve as a good lesson for us, because it has shown us that the paralysis of power and will is the first step towards complete degradation and oblivion. We lost confidence for only one moment, but it was enough to disrupt the balance of forces in the world. As a result, the old treaties and agreements are no longer effective. Entreaties and requests do not help. Anything that does not suit the dominant state, the powers that be, is denounced as archaic, obsolete and useless. At the same time, everything it regards as useful is presented as the ultimate truth and forced on others regardless of the cost, abusively and by any means available. Those who refuse to comply are subjected to strong-arm tactics. What I am saying now does not concerns only Russia, and Russia is not the only country that is worried about this. This has to do with the entire system of international relations, and sometimes even US allies. The collapse of the Soviet Union led to a redivision of the world, and the norms of international law that developed by that time– and the most important of them, the fundamental norms that were adopted following WWII and largely formalised its outcome– came in the way of those who declared themselves the winners of the Cold War. Of course, practice, international relations and the rules regulating them had to take into account the changes that took place in the world and in the balance of forces. However, this should have been done professionally, smoothly, patiently, and with due regard and respect for the interests of all states and one's own responsibility. Instead, we saw a state of euphoria created by the feeling of absolute superiority, a kind of modern absolutism, coupled with the low cultural standards and arrogance of those who formulated and pushed through decisions that suited only themselves. The situation took a different turn. There are many examples of this. First a bloody military operation was waged against Belgrade, without the UN Security Council's sanction but with combat aircraft and missiles used in the heart of Europe. The bombing of peaceful cities and vital infrastructure went on for several weeks. I have to recall these facts, because some Western colleagues prefer to forget them, and when we mentioned the event, they prefer to avoid speaking about international law, instead emphasising the circumstances which they interpret as they think necessary. Then came the turn of Iraq, Libya and Syria. The illegal use of military power against Libya and the distortion of all the UN Security Council decisions on Libya ruined the state, created a huge seat of international terrorism, and pushed the country towards a humanitarian catastrophe, into the vortex of a civil war, which has continued there for years. The tragedy, which was created for hundreds of thousands and even millions of people not only in Libya but in the whole region, has led to a large-scale exodus from the Middle East and North Africa to Europe. A similar fate was also prepared for Syria. The combat operations conducted by the Western coalition in that country without the Syrian government's approval or UN Security Council's sanction can only be defined as aggression and intervention. But the example that stands apart from the above events is, of course, the invasion of Iraq without any legal grounds. They used the pretext of allegedly reliable information available in the United States about the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. To prove that allegation, the US Secretary of State held up a vial with white power, publicly, for the whole world to see, assuring the international community that it was a chemical warfare agent created in Iraq. It later turned out that all of that was a fake and a sham, and that Iraq did not have any chemical weapons. Incredible and shocking but true. We witnessed lies made at the highest state level and voiced from the high UN rostrum. As a result we see a tremendous loss in human life, damage, destruction, and a colossal upsurge of terrorism. Overall, it appears that nearly everywhere, in many regions of the world where the United States brought its law and order, this created bloody, non-healing wounds and the curse of international terrorism and extremism. I have only mentioned the most glaring but far from only examples of disregard for international law. This array includes promises not to expand NATO eastwards even by an inch. To reiterate: they have deceived us, or, to put it simply, they have played us. Sure, one often hears that politics is a dirty business. It could be, but it shouldn't be as dirty as it is now, not to such an extent. This type of con-artist behaviour is contrary not only to the principles of international relations but also and above all to the generally accepted norms of morality and ethics. Where is justice and truth here? Just lies and hypocrisy all around. Incidentally, US politicians, political scientists and journalists write and say that a veritable""empire of lies"" has been created inside the United States in recent years. It is hard to disagree with this– it is really so. But one should not be modest about it: the United States is still a great country and a system-forming power. All its satellites not only humbly and obediently say yes to and parrot it at the slightest pretext but also imitate its behaviour and enthusiastically accept the rules it is offering them. Therefore, one can say with good reason and confidence that the whole so-called Western bloc formed by the United States in its own image and likeness is, in its entirety, the very same""empire of lies."" As for our country, after the disintegration of the USSR, given the entire unprecedented openness of the new, modern Russia, its readiness to work honestly with the United States and other Western partners, and its practically unilateral disarmament, they immediately tried to put the final squeeze on us, finish us off, and utterly destroy us. This is how it was in the 1990s and the early 2000s, when the so-called collective West was actively supporting separatism and gangs of mercenaries in southern Russia. What victims, what losses we had to sustain and what trials we had to go through at that time before we broke the back of international terrorism in the Caucasus! We remember this and will never forget. Properly speaking, the attempts to use us in their own interests never ceased until quite recently: they sought to destroy our traditional values and force on us their false values that would erode us, our people from within, the attitudes they have been aggressively imposing on their countries, attitudes that are directly leading to degradation and degeneration, because they are contrary to human nature. This is not going to happen. No one has ever succeeded in doing this, nor will they succeed now. Despite all that, in December 2021, we made yet another attempt to reach agreement with the United States and its allies on the principles of European security and NATO's non-expansion. Our efforts were in vain. The United States has not changed its position. It does not believe it necessary to agree with Russia on a matter that is critical for us. The United States is pursuing its own objectives, while neglecting our interests. Of course, this situation begs a question: what next, what are we to expect? If history is any guide, we know that in 1940 and early 1941 the Soviet Union went to great lengths to prevent war or at least delay its outbreak. To this end, the USSR sought not to provoke the potential aggressor until the very end by refraining or postponing the most urgent and obvious preparations it had to make to defend itself from an imminent attack. When it finally acted, it was too late. As a result, the country was not prepared to counter the invasion by Nazi Germany, which attacked our Motherland on June 22, 1941, without declaring war. The country stopped the enemy and went on to defeat it, but this came at a tremendous cost. The attempt to appease the aggressor ahead of the Great Patriotic War proved to be a mistake which came at a high cost for our people. In the first months after the hostilities broke out, we lost vast territories of strategic importance, as well as millions of lives. We will not make this mistake the second time. We have no right to do so. Those who aspire to global dominance have publicly designated Russia as their enemy. They did so with impunity. Make no mistake, they had no reason to act this way. It is true that they have considerable financial, scientific, technological, and military capabilities. We are aware of this and have an objective view of the economic threats we have been hearing, just as our ability to counter this brash and never-ending blackmail. Let me reiterate that we have no illusions in this regard and are extremely realistic in our assessments. As for military affairs, even after the dissolution of the USSR and losing a considerable part of its capabilities, today's Russia remains one of the most powerful nuclear states. Moreover, it has a certain advantage in several cutting-edge weapons. In this context, there should be no doubt for anyone that any potential aggressor will face defeat and ominous consequences should it directly attack our country. At the same time, technology, including in the defence sector, is changing rapidly. One day there is one leader, and tomorrow another, but a military presence in territories bordering on Russia, if we permit it to go ahead, will stay for decades to come or maybe forever, creating an ever mounting and totally unacceptable threat for Russia. Even now, with NATO's eastward expansion the situation for Russia has been becoming worse and more dangerous by the year. Moreover, these past days NATO leadership has been blunt in its statements that they need to accelerate and step up efforts to bring the alliance's infrastructure closer to Russia's borders. In other words, they have been toughening their position. We cannot stay idle and passively observe these developments. This would be an absolutely irresponsible thing to do for us. Any further expansion of the North Atlantic alliance's infrastructure or the ongoing efforts to gain a military foothold of the Ukrainian territory are unacceptable for us. Of course, the question is not about NATO itself. It merely serves as a tool of US foreign policy. The problem is that in territories adjacent to Russia, which I have to note is our historical land, a hostile""anti-Russia"" is taking shape. Fully controlled from the outside, it is doing everything to attract NATO armed forces and obtain cutting-edge weapons. For the United States and its allies, it is a policy of containing Russia, with obvious geopolitical dividends. For our country, it is a matter of life and death, a matter of our historical future as a nation. This is not an exaggeration; this is a fact. It is not only a very real threat to our interests but to the very existence of our state and to its sovereignty. It is the red line which we have spoken about on numerous occasions. They have crossed it. This brings me to the situation in Donbass. We can see that the forces that staged the coup in Ukraine in 2014 have seized power, are keeping it with the help of ornamental election procedures and have abandoned the path of a peaceful conflict settlement. For eight years, for eight endless years we have been doing everything possible to settle the situation by peaceful political means. Everything was in vain. As I said in my previous address, you cannot look without compassion at what is happening there. It became impossible to tolerate it. We had to stop that atrocity, that genocide of the millions of people who live there and who pinned their hopes on Russia, on all of us. It is their aspirations, the feelings and pain of these people that were the main motivating force behind our decision to recognise the independence of the Donbass people's republics. I would like to additionally emphasise the following. Focused on their own goals, the leading NATO countries are supporting the far-right nationalists and neo-Nazis in Ukraine, those who will never forgive the people of Crimea and Sevastopol for freely making a choice to reunite with Russia. They will undoubtedly try to bring war to Crimea just as they have done in Donbass, to kill innocent people just as members of the punitive units of Ukrainian nationalists and Hitler's accomplices did during the Great Patriotic War. They have also openly laid claim to several other Russian regions. If we look at the sequence of events and the incoming reports, the showdown between Russia and these forces cannot be avoided. It is only a matter of time. They are getting ready and waiting for the right moment. Moreover, they went as far as aspire to acquire nuclear weapons. We will not let this happen. I have already said that Russia accepted the new geopolitical reality after the dissolution of the USSR. We have been treating all new post-Soviet states with respect and will continue to act this way. We respect and will respect their sovereignty, as proven by the assistance we provided to Kazakhstan when it faced tragic events and a challenge in terms of its statehood and integrity. However, Russia cannot feel safe, develop, and exist while facing a permanent threat from the territory of today's Ukraine. Let me remind you that in 2000–2005 we used our military to push back against terrorists in the Caucasus and stood up for the integrity of our state. We preserved Russia. In 2014, we supported the people of Crimea and Sevastopol. In 2015, we used our Armed Forces to create a reliable shield that prevented terrorists from Syria from penetrating Russia. This was a matter of defending ourselves. We had no other choice. The same is happening today. They did not leave us any other option for defending Russia and our people, other than the one we are forced to use today. In these circumstances, we have to take bold and immediate action. The people's republics of Donbass have asked Russia for help. In this context, in accordance with Article 51(Chapter VII) of the UN Charter, with permission of Russia's Federation Council, and in execution of the treaties of friendship and mutual assistance with the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic, ratified by the Federal Assembly on February 22, I made a decision to carry out a special military operation. The purpose of this operation is to protect people who, for eight years now, have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kiev regime. To this end, we will seek to demilitarise and denazify Ukraine, as well as bring to trial those who perpetrated numerous bloody crimes against civilians, including against citizens of the Russian Federation. It is not our plan to occupy the Ukrainian territory. We do not intend to impose anything on anyone by force. At the same time, we have been hearing an increasing number of statements coming from the West that there is no need any more to abide by the documents setting forth the outcomes of World War II, as signed by the totalitarian Soviet regime. How can we respond to that? The outcomes of World War II and the sacrifices our people had to make to defeat Nazism are sacred. This does not contradict the high values of human rights and freedoms in the reality that emerged over the post-war decades. This does not mean that nations cannot enjoy the right to self-determination, which is enshrined in Article 1 of the UN Charter. Let me remind you that the people living in territories which are part of today's Ukraine were not asked how they want to build their lives when the USSR was created or after World War II. Freedom guides our policy, the freedom to choose independently our future and the future of our children. We believe that all the peoples living in today's Ukraine, anyone who want to do this, must be able to enjoy this right to make a free choice. In this context I would like to address the citizens of Ukraine. In 2014, Russia was obliged to protect the people of Crimea and Sevastopol from those who you yourself call""nats."" The people of Crimea and Sevastopol made their choice in favour of being with their historical homeland, Russia, and we supported their choice. As I said, we could not act otherwise. The current events have nothing to do with a desire to infringe on the interests of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. They are connected with the defending Russia from those who have taken Ukraine hostage and are trying to use it against our country and our people. I reiterate: we are acting to defend ourselves from the threats created for us and from a worse peril than what is happening now. I am asking you, however hard this may be, to understand this and to work together with us so as to turn this tragic page as soon as possible and to move forward together, without allowing anyone to interfere in our affairs and our relations but developing them independently, so as to create favourable conditions for overcoming all these problems and to strengthen us from within as a single whole, despite the existence of state borders. I believe in this, in our common future. I would also like to address the military personnel of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Comrade officers, Your fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers did not fight the Nazi occupiers and did not defend our common Motherland to allow today's neo-Nazis to seize power in Ukraine. You swore the oath of allegiance to the Ukrainian people and not to the junta, the people's adversary which is plundering Ukraine and humiliating the Ukrainian people. I urge you to refuse to carry out their criminal orders. I urge you to immediately lay down arms and go home. I will explain what this means: the military personnel of the Ukrainian army who do this will be able to freely leave the zone of hostilities and return to their families. I want to emphasise again that all responsibility for the possible bloodshed will lie fully and wholly with the ruling Ukrainian regime. I would now like to say something very important for those who may be tempted to interfere in these developments from the outside. No matter who tries to stand in our way or all the more so create threats for our country and our people, they must know that Russia will respond immediately, and the consequences will be such as you have never seen in your entire history. No matter how the events unfold, we are ready. All the necessary decisions in this regard have been taken. I hope that my words will be heard. Citizens of Russia, The culture and values, experience and traditions of our ancestors invariably provided a powerful underpinning for the wellbeing and the very existence of entire states and nations, their success and viability. Of course, this directly depends on the ability to quickly adapt to constant change, maintain social cohesion, and readiness to consolidate and summon all the available forces in order to move forward. We always need to be strong, but this strength can take on different forms. The""empire of lies,"" which I mentioned in the beginning of my speech, proceeds in its policy primarily from rough, direct force. This is when our saying on being""all brawn and no brains"" applies. We all know that having justice and truth on our side is what makes us truly strong. If this is the case, it would be hard to disagree with the fact that it is our strength and our readiness to fight that are the bedrock of independence and sovereignty and provide the necessary foundation for building a reliable future for your home, your family, and your Motherland. Dear compatriots, I am certain that devoted soldiers and officers of Russia's Armed Forces will perform their duty with professionalism and courage. I have no doubt that the government institutions at all levels and specialists will work effectively to guarantee the stability of our economy, financial system and social wellbeing, and the same applies to corporate executives and the entire business community. I hope that all parliamentary parties and civil society take a consolidated, patriotic position. At the end of the day, the future of Russia is in the hands of its multi-ethnic people, as has always been the case in our history. This means that the decisions that I made will be executed, that we will achieve the goals we have set, and reliably guarantee the security of our Motherland. I believe in your support and the invincible force rooted in the love for our Fatherland."

Vladimir Putin stressed the objective necessity to take that decision based on the Ukrainian authorities' aggression in Donbass and their categorical refusal to implement the Minsk Agreements. Recep Tayyip Erdogan gave his well-known views on the matter. The issues of working out long-term legally binding security guarantees for the Russian Federation were also discussed. In this context, Vladimir Putin expressed his disappointment with the US and NATO response which came down to an attempt to ignore Russia's legitimate concerns and demands. The presidents agreed to continue Russian-Turkish contacts in various formats. "

It embodies the feelings of respect our citizens feel for their noble defenders, our pride in all those who served and serve in the Army and the Navy, recognition of their heroic merits to the Fatherland to assert our national interests, sovereignty and independence. Patriotism and the unity of our nation, the exploits of its devoted sons and daughters have always been the foundation of the martial history of our thousand-year-old country, its glory and victories. We are proud of the many generations of its defenders: the guards of Alexander Nevsky and Dmitry Donskoy, the warriors of Minin and Pozharsky and the heroes of Poltava and Borodino, Stalingrad and the unstoppable assault on Berlin, all those who brought glory to our Fatherland according to the great traditions of our ancestors. On this day, we have sincere, heart-felt words of gratitude for the Great Patriotic War veterans. We will always remember that you, the valiant generation of victors, crushed Nazism and saved our country and the entire world from this barbaric, merciless force. Your feat is a summit of human history, a great example for all those who are serving today in the Army and the Navy, and protecting Russia from external threats on land, in air and at sea. Comrade officers, Ensuring that our country can defend itself remains a primary responsibility of government, and the Armed Forces serve as a reliable guarantee of our national security, the peaceful and orderly lives of our people and Russia's stable and steady development. We can see the difficult international situation and the threats posed by current challenges, such as the erosion of the arms control system and NATO's military activities. And yet, Russia's appeals to build a system of equal and indivisible security that would reliably defend all countries, remain unanswered. Our country is always open to a direct and honest dialogue and ready to search for diplomatic solutions to the most complicated issues. But I want to repeat that Russia's interests and the security of our people are an indisputable priority. So, we will continue to strengthen and modernise our Army and Navy, striving to increase their effectiveness, so they are fitted out with the most cutting-edge equipment. We have done a lot over the previous years to carry out the quality modernisation of the Armed Forces. They have gained in mobility and acquired new combat experience. During the operation in Syria, they proved in practice that they are capable of accomplishing the most difficult tasks. The training and coordination of army units and formations have greatly improved. This is clearly shown by snap drills, manoeuvres and regular large-scale military exercises, including jointly with our allies, as well as responsible peacekeeping operations. We have weapons that are second to none in the world and they are operational. We will continue to develop promising weapon systems, including hypersonic weapons and those based on new physical principles, and expand the use of advanced digital technology and elements of artificial intelligence. Complexes like these are weapons of the future, which can boost the potential of our Armed Forces several-fold. At the same time, we understand that the most advanced equipment is operated by people. It is very important that they have the latest knowledge and excellent training; however, personal qualities of Russian soldiers, such as patriotism, endurance, selflessness and mutual assistance have always– at all times– been of utmost importance. The role of a commander in developing these features is indispensable. Our officers are not only the core of our Army and Navy– these people are sincerely devoted to Russia and their military duty. I thank you for your faithful and honest service to our Motherland, for the responsible training of personnel, for fulfilling your duties conscientiously and with ultimate dedication, and holding sacred the spirit and character of the national military school. Friends, As Supreme Commander-in-Chief, I have confidence in you, Russian soldiers and officers, in your high professionalism, bravery and reliability, that you will guard the peace of our people, and stand up for the national interests of our great country. I wish you good health and every success in your service. I want to extend the best wishes to your families and friends. Again, my sincere greetings to you on this holiday!"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67838,Vladimir Putin answered media questions,2022-02-22T19:40:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",The President took a number of questions from reporters about recognition of the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics.,"Pavel Zarubin: Pavel Zarubin, Rossiya TV Channel. Your decisions and statements yesterday have certainly evoked a stormy international response, a real uproar. And, of course, there is a lot of speculation about how Putin allegedly wants to restore Russia to the borders of the Russian Empire. You have already said that this is not the case but in what borders have the DPR and the LPR been recognised? After all, Donetsk and Lugansk regions are large and Russian people live there as well. And a question that suggests itself: what will happen with the Minsk agreements now? Russia has insisted on their implementation for seven years now. And, of course, I have to ask you to comment on the latest news. The Federation Council has just approved your request to deploy the Armed Forces of Russia abroad. What can you tell us about this? How big could this operation get? Thank you very much. President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Deploying the Armed Forces abroad. Second, the borders of the DPR and the LPR, and the Russian Empire, right? Pavel Zarubin: And the Minsk agreements. What will happen with them now? Vladimir Putin: Let us start with the Minsk agreements– the Minsk Package of Measures to settle the situation in southeastern Ukraine. That is what they are called. It is not seven but almost eight full years that we have been working on this. By""we"", I mean Russia, and yours truly was the author of these documents. Therefore, I would like to emphasise again that we were interested in seeing this package of measures implemented, because it was the result of a compromise. The leaders of the two then unrecognised republics signed these documents. Incidentally, one of them was killed in a terrorist act. He was killed by the special services of Ukraine, an agent of these services. There is no question here. This is an obvious thing, simply an outright political assassination. But what matters is that the leaders of the two republics signed these documents. We managed to broker this compromise at that time. By the way, it was not easy to do this because initially the leaders of these entities did not want to take part in the Minsk agreements and to sign their names to these documents. But a compromise was reached nonetheless, which was real progress towards achieving a settlement by peaceful means. As it was said yesterday during the Security Council meeting, over all these years, the efforts of the current Kiev authorities reduced it all to naught. So, the Minsk agreements were dead long before yesterday's recognition of the people's republics of Donbass. They were killed not by us and not by the representatives of these republics, but by the current Kiev authorities. In fact, yesterday's event– the recognition of these republics– was dictated precisely by the fact that the Ukrainian leadership had publicly declared that they were not going to abide by these agreements. Not going to abide by them. Well, what else can you say to that? The top officials have publicly said so. What more is there to wait for? Should we wait for this abuse of people to continue, this genocide of the almost four million people who live in these territories? It is unbearable to watch. You can see for yourself what is going on there. Well, how can you continue to put up with that? As a matter of fact, that is all there is to it. When we spoke to our European colleagues, they all said the same thing:""Yes, this is the way forward,"" but in reality they were unable to force their partners in the current leadership in Kiev to do so. So, we were compelled to take this decision and, in this sense, indeed, the Minsk agreements do not exist anymore. Why abide by them if we have recognised the independence of these entities? With regard to the borders within which we will recognise these republics, we did recognise them, which means we recognised their foundational documents, including the Constitution, and the Constitution stipulates their borders within the Donetsk and Lugansk regions at the time when they were part of Ukraine. But we expect, and I want to emphasise this, that all disputes will be resolved during talks between the current Kiev authorities and the leaders of these republics. Unfortunately, at this point in time, we realise that it is impossible to do so, since hostilities are still ongoing and, moreover, they are showing signs of escalating. But I hope this is how it will turn out in the future. Regarding the use of the Armed Forces abroad. Well, of course. By all means. We signed treaties yesterday, and these treaties with the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic contain relevant clauses that say that we will provide these republics with appropriate assistance, including military. Since there is an ongoing conflict there, we make it clear by this decision that, if need be, we plan to fulfill our obligations. Please, go ahead. Veronika Ichyotkina: Good afternoon. TASS news agency. A question about Donbass as well. Obviously, Ukraine cannot or does not want to recognise the sovereignty of the DPR and the LPR, and they are certainly unhappy about our decision to recognise the sovereignty of the republics. After what happened yesterday and today, do you see any prospects for improving relations between Moscow and Kiev? If so, what should Moscow and Kiev do to make it happen? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: You know, we discussed these issues with our European partners during our talks and meetings for many hours. In fact, we also spoke with the Americans about these issues more than once. I think this was not said in public, but I will say it. Naturally, this question suggests itself: what should both sides, or Kiev do for the situation to be considered settled in the long-term historical perspective so that we could live in peace and there would be no conflicts, to say nothing of armed conflicts? I will reveal this dark secret to you. Ultimately, there is nothing secret about this. The first thing that everyone should do is to recognise the will of the people who live in Sevastopol and in Crimea. I have said this many times but I want to stress it again. In what way was this expression of popular will any worse than what happened in Kosovo? In no way. It is just that their decisions were made by parliament and ours at a nationwide referendum. I would like to emphasise once again: nobody could have herded people into polling stations with machineguns or bayonets. They came there of their own free will and made their decision to reunite with Russia. This decision must be respected. If those countries that argue against it consider themselves democracies, they must recognise it eventually. A referendum is the highest form of democracy. This is my first point. The second. We have spoken about this publicly many times and, in effect, this is the subject of our sharpest dispute with Washington and NATO. We are categorically opposed to Ukraine joining NATO because this poses a threat to us and we have arguments to support this. I have repeatedly spoken about it in this hall. On this point, of course, we are proceeding from what many people are saying, including in the capitals of Western countries, I mean that the best decision would be for our colleagues in the Western countries not to lose face, so to say, and for Kiev itself to refuse to join NATO. In effect, in so doing, they would translate the idea of neutrality into life. This is my second point. My third point, unfortunately, is not relevant any longer. I have always said that the Donbass issue had to be resolved through peace talks and implementation of the Minsk agreements. Finally, the all-important fourth point. Everything mentioned so far could be upset in a second if our so-called partners continue to pump the current Kiev authorities full of modern types of weapons. Therefore, the most important point is the demilitarisation, to a certain extent, of today's Ukraine because it is the only factor that can be objectively controlled, monitored and responded to. Everything else can change completely in either direction overnight, the way, for example, the current Ukrainian leader made the previous leader persona non grata by initiating criminal proceedings against him for his allegedly treacherous actions, because he disapproved of the Minsk agreements. These potential agreements, which I have just mentioned, could be repudiated the same way, if they were to be approved by the current leadership. He would just leave for Washington, Paris or Berlin and that's it, while we would be left with an""anti-Russia"" armed to the teeth. This is totally unacceptable, particularly now, after Ukraine's current authorities have declared their nuclear ambitions. Please, go ahead. Alexander Yunashev: Alexander Yunashev, Life. Mr President, yesterday, in your address to the Russian people you cited Zelensky, and it seems to be not for the first time, as saying that Ukraine might get nuclear weapons again and Ukraine might join the nuclear club. Vladimir Putin:…I just said this. Alexander Yunashev: Are these just statements or is the threat of nuclear weapons being deployed in Ukraine at our border real? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: I have just mentioned it. We take it that these words were primarily addressed to us. I want to say that we have heard them. Ever since Soviet times, Ukraine has had fairly broad nuclear competencies, they have several nuclear power units and the nuclear industry is fairly well developed, they have dedicated schools, there is everything there to solve this issue much faster than in those countries which are solving matters from scratch. I will not enumerate them, you know all about it anyway. This is number one. They only lack one thing– uranium enrichment systems. But this is a matter of technology, it is not unsolvable for Ukraine, it can be remedied quite easily. As to delivery vehicles, I think I already said in yesterday's address that they have old Soviet-made Tochka-U missiles with a range of 100 plus kilometres, 110 kilometres. This is also not a problem in view of the competencies, say, at Yuzhmash, which used to manufacture intercontinental ballistic missiles for the Soviet Union. What is the threat to us? The appearance of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine is a strategic threat to us. Because the range can be extended from 110 kilometres to 300, to 500– and that is it, Moscow will be in the strike zone. This is a strategic threat to us. And that is how we took it. We definitely must and will take it very seriously. Andrei Kolesnikov: Andrei Kolesnikov, Kommersant newspaper. Mr President, do you think it is possible in today's world to resolve problems with force and remain on the side of good? This is my first question. The second one is more technical, if you will. In your view, how far might troops advance: up to the contact line, to the administrative borders of the DPR and LPR, or somewhere else? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: First, I did not say our troops would enter right away, after our meeting here. That is first. Second, it is absolutely impossible to predict the detailed path of possible actions. It depends on the concrete situation that is unfolding on the ground, as they say. Regarding the question if all issues can and must be resolved by force or if it is possible to remain on the side of good. Well, why do you think that good must always be frail and helpless? I do not think that is true. I think good means being able to defend oneself. We will proceed from that. Thank you. All the best to you."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67837,Statements for the press following Russian-Azerbaijani talks,2022-02-22T19:05:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin and President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev made statements for the press following Russian-Azerbaijani talks.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, Ladies and gentlemen, The Declaration on Allied Interaction between Russia and Azerbaijan, which has just been signed, marks the transition of our interstate relations to a qualitatively new level. This strategic document has become the centrepiece and the key result of today's talks. It is highly symbolic that the Declaration on Allied Relations was signed in the year when we mark the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Russia and Azerbaijan. Russian-Azerbaijani cooperation has grown stronger and expanded over the past decades, and now includes many concrete, mutually beneficial projects in the political, economic and cultural spheres. We are firmly committed to further developing our truly close allied interaction based on solid traditions of friendship, neighbourly relations, mutual respect and consideration for each other's interests. Today, we have had a detailed discussion of the entire range of current issues on the bilateral agenda. First of all, we discussed the opportunities and prospects for building up mutually profitable trade and economic ties. I will note that our bilateral trade in 2021 rose by 16 percent to reach almost three and a half, US$3.4 billion, whereas the flow of reciprocal capital investments stands at about US$6 billion. The Russian-Azerbaijani intergovernmental commission will hold its regular meeting soon. We also plan to send Russian business missions to Azerbaijan to study the prospects for developing cooperation in energy, agriculture and a number of other areas. Russian businesses are interested in collaboration with Azerbaijan in electric power engineering and are ready to assist in upgrading Azerbaijan's power grids and to join in the renewable energy projects. Effective partnership has been arranged in industry, too. GAZ Group and Azermash launched a joint plant last year to produce commercial and special-purpose automobiles. The rolling stock of Azerbaijan's railways and Baku underground is being renewed with Russian participation. A KAMAZ service centre is under construction in Azerbaijan. We think it important to further enhance the interaction of our two countries in finance. A more active use of national currencies in mutual settlements and Azerbaijan's banks joining the Russian Central Bank's System for the Transfer of Financial Messages would obviously contribute to that. Russia and Azerbaijan's cooperation in medicine and pharmaceuticals is on the rise. Our countries act as partners in countering the spread of COVID-19. At the peak of the pandemic, teams of specialists from Russia's leading medical institutions were sent to assist Azerbaijani doctors, and deliveries of the Sputnik V vaccines were organised. Cooperation in the cultural area traditionally proceeds at a high level. The Days of Azerbaijan started in Moscow recently, with exhibitions, concerts, literature readings and many other exciting cultural events to be held. In turn, Azerbaijan will host the next Youth Forum of the two countries in early March. We are grateful to Azerbaijan's leadership for the support and promotion of the Russian language and culture in the Republic. Let me remind you that the country has more than 300 schools with teaching in Russia while most universities have Russian-language faculties. During the talks, the President reminded me that there are 340, not 300 schools– we are very grateful for this as we attach great importance to it, we have been unable to follow up and count. Let me say that at present over 11,000 Azerbaijani students are studying in Russia with more than a thousand of them funded by federal grants. Naturally, we paid special attention to the issues of normalising relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia. You are aware that yesterday I had a telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Armenia. We reaffirmed the importance of the full-fledged implementation of all trilateral agreements on Nagorno-Karabakh reached by the leaders of Azerbaijan, Armenia and Russia. We feel it is important that life in the region is being normalised and is becoming peaceful. Over 50,000 refugees have already returned to their homes. Practical issues of infrastructure restoration and protection of the sites of historical heritage, religion and culture are being addressed. The Azerbaijani side praised the activities of the Russian peacekeeping contingent and Russia's overall contribution to stabilisation around Nagorno-Karabakh. Our peacekeepers monitor the situation round-the-clock, ensuring that ceasefire regime is maintained, conduct mine clearance operations, take part in humanitarian actions and render assistance to the local population. Russian military doctors are taking measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, including by providing Russian jabs. We have agreed to continue efforts to unblock all economic and transport links in the region as soon as possible. This involves restoring the full volume of passenger and cargo traffic between Azerbaijan and Armenia as well as the other countries of the region and drafting concrete collaborative projects for implementation in such areas as trade, industry, agriculture, and infrastructure. The immediate participants in the process, Azerbaijan and Armenia, are interested in this, as are all their neighbours, of course. Another priority is the launch of the delimitation and demarcation of the Armenia-Azerbaijan border. Russia has worked hard to achieve the above tasks and targets and will carry on with this. We will certainly continue to give every support to settling any controversial issues including those of the borderline, and to help in solving the current burning problems. In general, today's talks have clearly indicated that Russia and Azerbaijan are both interested in ensuring stability and security in the Caucasus and Caspian regions and promoting integration processes throughout the entire Eurasian space. To conclude, I would like to express appreciation to the President of Azerbaijan for our productive joint work today. I believe that the agreements reached today will serve to further strengthen the whole range of Russian-Azerbaijani relations for the good of both countries. Thank you for your attention. President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev Aliyev IlhamPresident of Azerbaijan: Mr President, First of all, I would like to thank you for your invitation to pay an official visit to Russia. I am delighted to revisit Moscow. We meet on a regular basis. We also met less than three months ago and discussed important items on the bilateral agenda and regional matters. The intensity of our meetings highlights the dynamic nature of our expanding ties. Russia and Azerbaijan are linked by age-old bonds of friendship and neighbourliness. As the President of Russia has noted today, they are being elevated to a qualitatively new level. We have a very broad contractual legal framework. Although 245 documents have been signed, the Declaration that has been signed today has particular significance and stands out among them. This Declaration elevates our relations to an allied level. This is a great privilege and a great responsibility. We have moved persistently towards this event, we expanded the potential of our cooperation and built upon our relations that are based on sincerity, neighbourliness, pragmatism and consideration for each other's interests. Practical work on the Declaration on Allied Interaction was launched just over a year ago. Since then, the relevant expert groups from both countries have coordinated a very large document with 43 clauses, which encompasses virtually all the main spheres of our activity. The Declaration's first clause states expressly that the parties shall build their relations on the basis of mutual respect for independence, state sovereignty, territorial integrity, the inviolability of borders and non-interference in each other's domestic affairs. This clause notes the nature of our relations and states that these relations have withstood the test of time and are based, as I have already said, on friendly feelings, mutual interests and aspirations for the future. Consequently, this document sums up the result of many years of joint work and opens up tremendous prospects for the future. We will strengthen our political interaction. As before, we will support each other at international organisations, we will expand mutual trade, the volume of mutual trade, and we will address all matters on the agenda. Today President Putin and I spent over five hours together and the time flew. Five hours of intense communication in itself is an indication of how close and sincere our ties are. We believe that new opportunities are opening in the trade and economic sphere. The President of Russia noted a significant growth in our trade. I am sure that positive trends will increase this year. As you know, this year marks the 30th anniversary of our diplomatic relations: in April we will celebrate this date. We approach this landmark with good potential. We have very promising opportunities in growing mutual investment. Today we also discussed in detail the possibilities for cooperation and deepening cooperation in the transport sector, and not just in a bilateral, but also in a multilateral, regional format. Considering the new developments in the region and the new geopolitical situation, there is a platform for cooperation, called""3+3"" scheme. I am sure that after the first step, the members and participants of this platform will continue to cooperate, in this sphere, too. The issue of opening communications in the region was also discussed today and, I think it has very good prospects. I would like to thank Mr President for praising our joint activities in cultural cooperation. This sphere is always a focus of the President's attention; we can say we are giving a boost to the development of this sphere. The figures the President of Russia cited about the number of schools teaching in the Russian language and the number of students from Azerbaijan studying in Russia speak for themselves. I would like to add that over 15,000 students are studying in the Russian departments of Azerbaijani universities, and the interest in courses given in Russian is growing. There are also offices of Moscow State University and Sechenov Medical Academy in our country, and we hope to increase the cooperation potential. This year we also plan to restore the regular sessions of the Baku Humanitarian Forum that were suspended because of the pandemic. The forum has been and will be held under the patronage of the presidents of Russia and Azerbaijan. Today we also discussed issues related to the involvement of Russian companies in operations in liberated areas. There is a lot of interest, and even today we have received 14 applications from Russian companies, which we are looking at closely. I believe that this new sphere of our cooperation will be useful from the practical point of view, too, and that it will promote the level of our cooperation. And, of course, we discussed in detail the post-conflict situation in the region today. We are grateful to Russia and President Putin personally for their role in ending the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia, as well as for their efforts to attain a post-conflict settlement. I believe that, given it has been such a long-standing confrontation that has lasted for about 30 years and given that Azerbaijan sustained such huge casualties, the fact that Azerbaijan and Armenia have now been involved in at least two international formats for over a year highlights our intentions. These formats include a working group at the level of Russian, Azerbaijani and Armenian deputy prime ministers, as well as the""3+3"" platform involving Russia, Turkey, Iran, Azerbaijan and Armenia. And, of course, we are expecting the Armenian party to completely fulfil all clauses of the Declaration dated November 9–10, 2020, as regards the withdrawal of all Armenian armed forces from the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, as well as the reopening of lines of communication between mainland Azerbaijan and the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. This is the Armenian party's legally binding obligation. But, unfortunately, work is proceeding very slowly in this direction. As I have already noted, President Vladimir Putin played an important role in ending the war and in transferring the settlement from the heated phase to the political settlement phase. Today, Russia is our main partner in the search for ways of normalising relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Opportunities exist for this. Azerbaijan has repeatedly voiced its readiness to launch work on a peace treaty that would also encompass matters of specifying borders and other matters required by any countries wishing to settle relations between them. I am confident that new regional realities will provide new opportunities. Azerbaijan aspires to a peaceful future, and we do not need a war. We have never needed a war. The liberation of Azerbaijani territory and the restoration of the country's territorial integrity by military means was a forced measure. And our readiness to address this matter by political means during the post-war phase serves as yet another confirmation of our intentions. I am confident that Russia and Azerbaijan will continue to make a substantial, and I would say decisive, contribution to strengthening peace in the Caucasus, to strengthening cooperation in the Caspian region and in Eurasia through joint efforts. Mr President, thank you once again for your invitation and hospitality, and I would like to use this opportunity to wish new successes and new achievements to the friendly and allied people of Russia."

In addition, Vladimir Putin and Ilham Aliyev made statements for the press.  * * *  President of Russia Vladimir Putin: It is a pleasure to see you. Thank you for accepting the invitation. Your visit is taking place prior to a landmark event in our bilateral relations, the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our countries. Today, we will sign a declaration on allied interaction, which will obviously become a new stage in the development of our relations, and it has been made possible after making headway in the Nagorno-Karabakh issue, although not completely settling it. Despite all the problems that we still have, I think that we can be satisfied with the level we have reached. We will discuss this in detail today. But in any case, there are certain agreements, not only in connection with ensuring the safety of local residents, but also those related to the development of trade and economic ties and enabling transport communication. I know that there are still some disputes, things to work on. But we are going to do everything in our power to ensure that the process moves forward using peaceful means and to attain satisfaction for all parties involved. By the way, I know that both the Russian Federation and your other neighbours are interested in dealing with these issues, including those regarding transport. Not only Azerbaijan and Armenia are interested in this, Russia and your other neighbours are interested as well. As for trade and economic relations, they have been developing progressively: despite the pandemic, our trade increased by more than 16 percent last year, which is a very good result. We appreciate that you support our interaction. We have very serious plans in this regard. Our economic ties are quite diversified and this lays the groundwork for further progress. We also appreciate the resolution of humanitarian issues that are quite sensitive for us and, in my view, also very important for Azerbaijan, above all, the support for the development of the Russian language. I know that there are 300 schools in Azerbaijan that teach Russian and it is quite popular. We will support this in every possible way in the future. Our regional ties are developing quite effectively. And, of course, I would like to take advantage of this opportunity, your visit, to inform you about what is taking place on our Ukrainian track. As you know, Russia decided yesterday to recognise the sovereignty of the two people's republics in Donbass. I would like to say right away that we can see, and we predicted speculations on this subject, that is, Russia's alleged intention to reinstate the empire within imperial borders. This has absolutely nothing to do with reality. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Russia recognised all the new geopolitical realities, and, as you know, it is working actively to strengthen our interaction with all the countries, the independent states that emerged in the post-Soviet space. We have always exercised great care, even in tense and very serious situations, like the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement, we proceeded from the interests of all states involved in this process, and we have always tried to reach mutually acceptable solutions. Unfortunately, we do not see such a level and quality of interaction with Ukraine following the coup there; such interaction has disappeared. I would like to note that this happened precisely after the coup and the illegal seizure of power by those who had done this. I have just spoken with the President of Kazakhstan, shortly before your visit today. I believe that this is the second very good example of the fact that Russia wholeheartedly supports the sovereignty of its neighbours, and that it strengthens such sovereignty in every way. As you know, we supported Kazakhstan at the request of the Kazakhstani leadership within the framework of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation in connection with the external aggression by international terrorists. We withdrew all our armed forces, part of the CSTO contingent, at the request of the Kazakhstani leadership as soon as this problem disappeared, and we continue to cooperate with Kazakhstan in all spheres of our work that, certainly, benefits Russia and Kazakhstan and strengthens the sovereignty of Kazakhstan. We intend to continue acting in the same manner with regard to all our neighbours. I repeat, the situation with Ukraine is different, and this is related to the fact that the territory of this country is, unfortunately, used by third countries to create threats against the Russian Federation. This is the only explanation. We will now be able to discuss everything in greater detail. I will inform you of the details. In any event, I want to say that I am happy to see you. Welcome. President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev: Thank you, Mr President. First of all, I would like to thank you for inviting me to Russia on an official visit. I am happy that we remain in contact regularly. We met less than three months ago, in late November [2021], and today I have come to the Russian Federation again. This is evidence of the dynamic development of our relations. We maintain regular contact, make telephone calls, and our in-person meetings are especially important, of course, in particular ahead of signing a vital document between our countries, as you have pointed out. It is symbolic that this is taking place on the eve of the 30th anniversary of our diplomatic relations, as you mentioned. I believe that this document will definitely have a very positive effect on our countries, our cooperation and on regional security. We appreciate the friendly and good-neighbourly relations between our countries, which we continue to strengthen. The signing of the Declaration of Allied Interaction is graphic proof of our active relations in recent years and the build-up of the potential of bilateral cooperation. We have not merely made declarations or expressed intentions but we have translated them into action. The Declaration is a comprehensive document with over 40 clauses. It covers the main areas of cooperation and, as I have pointed out, it will be extremely important for the future of our bilateral relations. Overall, political relations between our countries have been developing positively in recent years and are reaching the highest level ever now. I would like to say that I share your opinion regarding the positive development of trade and economic ties. Bilateral trade has exceeded $3 billion, growing by 16 percent, as you have said. It promises to grow this year as well, as is evidenced by the January figures. We are implementing many practical projects, which we will talk about today as well, of course. And thank you for your high appreciation of what we have been doing in the humanitarian sphere. I am grateful because you always note this and appreciate our efforts. And, as you have correctly noted, this is important for both Russia and Azerbaijan. As for schools, I would just like to clarify something: there are about 340 schools in Azerbaijan with instruction in Russian, with more than 140,000 students. More than 15,000 Azerbaijani citizens are enrolled in Russian Language departments at Azerbaijan universities. So, I think this is the most important and fundamental aspect of our relations and the future of our ties, because the Russian language has always united the countries of the former Soviet Union, and the next generations will find it difficult to establish communications without speaking Russian. Therefore, as I said, this is a very important factor in our life. As you noted, today we will certainly talk about the situation in our region, the post-conflict situation. The Russian Federation has played a very important role in ending the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia and in shifting the settlement process from the hot phase towards the political and diplomatic plane. The tripartite statement signed in November 2020, with your personal participation, was what helped us finally resolve this long-term conflict. The current situation is different – today the new geopolitical realities in the region are accepted by the international community. Russia also plays a very important role, I would say, a leading role in creating opportunities for the normalisation of relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia, for reopening transport routes, and establishing normal, neighbourly tires. We greatly appreciate this role and hope that the Armenian side will fulfill all the provisions of the November 2020 statement, just as we have. So, we have an extensive agenda, and this visit is special. This is my 48th visit to Russia as President, but it is also a special occasion, because today we are signing such an important document – once again – one of a historic nature. Thank you again for the invitation. <…>"

An early recovery of this key sector and its elevation to a new stage is impossible without active international cooperation. Energy modernisation requires well-thought-out approaches and meticulous consideration for national specifics. Efforts to ensure universal access to inexpensive, sustainable and modern energy sources are our key task. We are convinced that it is in the interests of the global community to make sure that the energy transition does not become a means of promoting the political and economic interests of certain players. Moreover, it should not be accompanied by sanctions or any other restrictions. The expanded use of natural gas as one of the cleanest fuels is becoming highly popular at this stage. In turn, Russia intends to continue uninterrupted gas deliveries, including LNG shipments, to global markets, to upgrade the available infrastructure and to invest more in the gas sector. We attach great significance to simplifying partnership within the Forum's framework, to coordinating efforts to promote the legitimate interests of gas exporters on global energy markets, to developing optimal solutions capable of ensuring the sustainable, reliable and cost-effective operation of the gas sector in alongside achieving climate goals. I am confident that you will hold constructive and detailed discussions at the Summit, and that you will chart new and promising forms and mechanisms of joint work."""

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67828,Address by the President of the Russian Federation,2022-02-21T22:35:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Citizens of Russia, friends, My address concerns the events in Ukraine and why this is so important for us, for Russia. Of course, my message is also addressed to our compatriots in Ukraine. The matter is very serious and needs to be discussed in depth. The situation in Donbass has reached a critical, acute stage. I am speaking to you directly today not only to explain what is happening but also to inform you of the decisions being made as well as potential further steps. I would like to emphasise again that Ukraine is not just a neighbouring country for us. It is an inalienable part of our own history, culture and spiritual space. These are our comrades, those dearest to us– not only colleagues, friends and people who once served together, but also relatives, people bound by blood, by family ties. Since time immemorial, the people living in the south-west of what has historically been Russian land have called themselves Russians and Orthodox Christians. This was the case before the 17th century, when a portion of this territory rejoined the Russian state, and after. It seems to us that, generally speaking, we all know these facts, that this is common knowledge. Still, it is necessary to say at least a few words about the history of this issue in order to understand what is happening today, to explain the motives behind Russia's actions and what we aim to achieve. So, I will start with the fact that modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia or, to be more precise, by Bolshevik, Communist Russia. This process started practically right after the 1917 revolution, and Lenin and his associates did it in a way that was extremely harsh on Russia– by separating, severing what is historically Russian land. Nobody asked the millions of people living there what they thought. Then, both before and after the Great Patriotic War, Stalin incorporated in the USSR and transferred to Ukraine some lands that previously belonged to Poland, Romania and Hungary. In the process, he gave Poland part of what was traditionally German land as compensation, and in 1954, Khrushchev took Crimea away from Russia for some reason and also gave it to Ukraine. In effect, this is how the territory of modern Ukraine was formed. But now I would like to focus attention on the initial period of the USSR's formation. I believe this is extremely important for us. I will have to approach it from a distance, so to speak. I will remind you that after the 1917 October Revolution and the subsequent Civil War, the Bolsheviks set about creating a new statehood. They had rather serious disagreements among themselves on this point. In 1922, Stalin occupied the positions of both the General Secretary of the Russian Communist Party(Bolsheviks) and the People's Commissar for Ethnic Affairs. He suggested building the country on the principles of autonomisation that is, giving the republics– the future administrative and territorial entities– broad powers upon joining a unified state. Lenin criticised this plan and suggested making concessions to the nationalists, whom he called""independents"" at that time. Lenin's ideas of what amounted in essence to a confederative state arrangement and a slogan about the right of nations to self-determination, up to secession, were laid in the foundation of Soviet statehood. Initially they were confirmed in the Declaration on the Formation of the USSR in 1922, and later on, after Lenin's death, were enshrined in the 1924 Soviet Constitution. This immediately raises many questions. The first is really the main one: why was it necessary to appease the nationalists, to satisfy the ceaselessly growing nationalist ambitions on the outskirts of the former empire? What was the point of transferring to the newly, often arbitrarily formed administrative units– the union republics– vast territories that had nothing to do with them? Let me repeat that these territories were transferred along with the population of what was historically Russia. Moreover, these administrative units were de facto given the status and form of national state entities. That raises another question: why was it necessary to make such generous gifts, beyond the wildest dreams of the most zealous nationalists and, on top of all that, give the republics the right to secede from the unified state without any conditions? At first glance, this looks absolutely incomprehensible, even crazy. But only at first glance. There is an explanation. After the revolution, the Bolsheviks' main goal was to stay in power at all costs, absolutely at all costs. They did everything for this purpose: accepted the humiliating Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, although the military and economic situation in Kaiser Germany and its allies was dramatic and the outcome of the First World War was a foregone conclusion, and satisfied any demands and wishes of the nationalists within the country. When it comes to the historical destiny of Russia and its peoples, Lenin's principles of state development were not just a mistake; they were worse than a mistake, as the saying goes. This became patently clear after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Of course, we cannot change past events, but we must at least admit them openly and honestly, without any reservations or politicking. Personally, I can add that no political factors, however impressive or profitable they may seem at any given moment, can or may be used as the fundamental principles of statehood. I am not trying to put the blame on anyone. The situation in the country at that time, both before and after the Civil War, was extremely complicated; it was critical. The only thing I would like to say today is that this is exactly how it was. It is a historical fact. Actually, as I have already said, Soviet Ukraine is the result of the Bolsheviks' policy and can be rightfully called""Vladimir Lenin's Ukraine."" He was its creator and architect. This is fully and comprehensively corroborated by archival documents, including Lenin's harsh instructions regarding Donbass, which was actually shoved into Ukraine. And today the""grateful progeny"" has overturned monuments to Lenin in Ukraine. They call it decommunization. You want decommunization? Very well, this suits us just fine. But why stop halfway? We are ready to show what real decommunizations would mean for Ukraine. Going back to history, I would like to repeat that the Soviet Union was established in the place of the former Russian Empire in 1922. But practice showed immediately that it was impossible to preserve or govern such a vast and complex territory on the amorphous principles that amounted to confederation. They were far removed from reality and the historical tradition. It is logical that the Red Terror and a rapid slide into Stalin's dictatorship, the domination of the communist ideology and the Communist Party's monopoly on power, nationalisation and the planned economy– all this transformed the formally declared but ineffective principles of government into a mere declaration. In reality, the union republics did not have any sovereign rights, none at all. The practical result was the creation of a tightly centralised and absolutely unitary state. In fact, what Stalin fully implemented was not Lenin's but his own principles of government. But he did not make the relevant amendments to the cornerstone documents, to the Constitution, and he did not formally revise Lenin's principles underlying the Soviet Union. From the look of it, there seemed to be no need for that, because everything seemed to be working well in conditions of the totalitarian regime, and outwardly it looked wonderful, attractive and even super-democratic. And yet, it is a great pity that the fundamental and formally legal foundations of our state were not promptly cleansed of the odious and utopian fantasies inspired by the revolution, which are absolutely destructive for any normal state. As it often happened in our country before, nobody gave any thought to the future. It seems that the Communist Party leaders were convinced that they had created a solid system of government and that their policies had settled the ethnic issue for good. But falsification, misconception, and tampering with public opinion have a high cost. The virus of nationalist ambitions is still with us, and the mine laid at the initial stage to destroy state immunity to the disease of nationalism was ticking. As I have already said, the mine was the right of secession from the Soviet Union. In the mid-1980s, the increasing socioeconomic problems and the apparent crisis of the planned economy aggravated the ethnic issue, which essentially was not based on any expectations or unfulfilled dreams of the Soviet peoples but primarily the growing appetites of the local elites. However, instead of analysing the situation, taking appropriate measures, first of all in the economy, and gradually transforming the political system and government in a well-considered and balanced manner, the Communist Party leadership only engaged in open doubletalk about the revival of the Leninist principle of national self-determination. Moreover, in the course of power struggle within the Communist Party itself, each of the opposing sides, in a bid to expand its support base, started to thoughtlessly incite and encourage nationalist sentiments, manipulating them and promising their potential supporters whatever they wished. Against the backdrop of the superficial and populist rhetoric about democracy and a bright future based either on a market or a planned economy, but amid a true impoverishment of people and widespread shortages, no one among the powers that be was thinking about the inevitable tragic consequences for the country. Next, they entirely embarked on the track beaten at the inception of the USSR and pandering to the ambitions of the nationalist elites nurtured within their own party ranks. But in so doing, they forgot that the CPSU no longer had– thank God– the tools for retaining power and the country itself, tools such as state terror and a Stalinist-type dictatorship, and that the notorious guiding role of the party was disappearing without a trace, like a morning mist, right before their eyes. And then, the September 1989 plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee approved a truly fatal document, the so-called ethnic policy of the party in modern conditions, the CPSU platform. It included the following provisions, I quote:""The republics of the USSR shall possess all the rights appropriate to their status as sovereign socialist states."" The next point:""The supreme representative bodies of power of the USSR republics can challenge and suspend the operation of the USSR Government's resolutions and directives in their territory."" And finally:""Each republic of the USSR shall have citizenship of its own, which shall apply to all of its residents."" Wasn't it clear what these formulas and decisions would lead to? Now is not the time or place to go into matters pertaining to state or constitutional law, or define the concept of citizenship. But one may wonder: why was it necessary to rock the country even more in that already complicated situation? The facts remain. Even two years before the collapse of the USSR, its fate was actually predetermined. It is now that radicals and nationalists, including and primarily those in Ukraine, are taking credit for having gained independence. As we can see, this is absolutely wrong. The disintegration of our united country was brought about by the historic, strategic mistakes on the part of the Bolshevik leaders and the CPSU leadership, mistakes committed at different times in state-building and in economic and ethnic policies. The collapse of the historical Russia known as the USSR is on their conscience. Despite all these injustices, lies and outright pillage of Russia, it was our people who accepted the new geopolitical reality that took shape after the dissolution of the USSR, and recognised the new independent states. Not only did Russia recognise these countries, but helped its CIS partners, even though it faced a very dire situation itself. This included our Ukrainian colleagues, who turned to us for financial support many times from the very moment they declared independence. Our country provided this assistance while respecting Ukraine's dignity and sovereignty. According to expert assessments, confirmed by a simple calculation of our energy prices, the subsidised loans Russia provided to Ukraine along with economic and trade preferences, the overall benefit for the Ukrainian budget in the period from 1991 to 2013 amounted to $250 billion. However, there was more to it than that. By the end of 1991, the USSR owed some $100 billion to other countries and international funds. Initially, there was this idea that all former Soviet republics will pay back these loans together, in the spirit of solidarity and proportionally to their economic potential. However, Russia undertook to pay back all Soviet debts and delivered on this promise by completing this process in 2017. In exchange for that, the newly independent states had to hand over to Russia part of the Soviet foreign assets. An agreement to this effect was reached with Ukraine in December 1994. However, Kiev failed to ratify these agreements and later simply refused to honour them by making demands for a share of the Diamond Treasury, gold reserves, as well as former USSR property and other assets abroad. Nevertheless, despite all these challenges, Russia always worked with Ukraine in an open and honest manner and, as I have already said, with respect for its interests. We developed our ties in multiple fields. Thus, in 2011, bilateral trade exceeded $50 billion. Let me note that in 2019, that is before the pandemic, Ukraine's trade with all EU countries combined was below this indicator. At the same time, it was striking how the Ukrainian authorities always preferred dealing with Russia in a way that ensured that they enjoy all the rights and privileges while remaining free from any obligations. The officials in Kiev replaced partnership with a parasitic attitude acting at times in an extremely brash manner. Suffice it to recall the continuous blackmail on energy transits and the fact that they literally stole gas. I can add that Kiev tried to use dialogue with Russia as a bargaining chip in its relations with the West, using the threat of closer ties with Russia for blackmailing the West to secure preferences by claiming that otherwise Russia would have a bigger influence in Ukraine. At the same time, the Ukrainian authorities– I would like to emphasise this– began by building their statehood on the negation of everything that united us, trying to distort the mentality and historical memory of millions of people, of entire generations living in Ukraine. It is not surprising that Ukrainian society was faced with the rise of far-right nationalism, which rapidly developed into aggressive Russophobia and neo-Nazism. This resulted in the participation of Ukrainian nationalists and neo-Nazis in the terrorist groups in the North Caucasus and the increasingly loud territorial claims to Russia. A role in this was played by external forces, which used a ramified network of NGOs and special services to nurture their clients in Ukraine and to bring their representatives to the seats of authority. It should be noted that Ukraine actually never had stable traditions of real statehood. And, therefore, in 1991 it opted for mindlessly emulating foreign models, which have no relation to history or Ukrainian realities. Political government institutions were readjusted many times to the rapidly growing clans and their self-serving interests, which had nothing to do with the interests of the Ukrainian people. Essentially, the so-called pro-Western civilisational choice made by the oligarchic Ukrainian authorities was not and is not aimed at creating better conditions in the interests of people's well-being but at keeping the billions of dollars that the oligarchs have stolen from the Ukrainians and are holding in their accounts in Western banks, while reverently accommodating the geopolitical rivals of Russia. Some industrial and financial groups and the parties and politicians on their payroll relied on the nationalists and radicals from the very beginning. Others claimed to be in favour of good relations with Russia and cultural and language diversity, coming to power with the help of their citizens who sincerely supported their declared aspirations, including the millions of people in the south-eastern regions. But after getting the positions they coveted, these people immediately betrayed their voters, going back on their election promises and instead steering a policy prompted by the radicals and sometimes even persecuting their former allies– the public organisations that supported bilingualism and cooperation with Russia. These people took advantage of the fact that their voters were mostly law-abiding citizens with moderate views who trusted the authorities, and that, unlike the radicals, they would not act aggressively or make use of illegal instruments. Meanwhile, the radicals became increasingly brazen in their actions and made more demands every year. They found it easy to force their will on the weak authorities, which were infected with the virus of nationalism and corruption as well and which artfully replaced the real cultural, economic and social interests of the people and Ukraine's true sovereignty with various ethnic speculations and formal ethnic attributes. A stable statehood has never developed in Ukraine; its electoral and other political procedures just serve as a cover, a screen for the redistribution of power and property between various oligarchic clans. Corruption, which is certainly a challenge and a problem for many countries, including Russia, has gone beyond the usual scope in Ukraine. It has literally permeated and corroded Ukrainian statehood, the entire system, and all branches of power. Radical nationalists took advantage of the justified public discontent and saddled the Maidan protest, escalating it to a coup d'état in 2014. They also had direct assistance from foreign states. According to reports, the US Embassy provided $1 million a day to support the so-called protest camp on Independence Square in Kiev. In addition, large amounts were impudently transferred directly to the opposition leaders' bank accounts, tens of millions of dollars. But the people who actually suffered, the families of those who died in the clashes provoked in the streets and squares of Kiev and other cities, how much did they get in the end? Better not ask. The nationalists who have seized power have unleashed a persecution, a real terror campaign against those who opposed their anti-constitutional actions. Politicians, journalists, and public activists were harassed and publicly humiliated. A wave of violence swept Ukrainian cities, including a series of high-profile and unpunished murders. One shudders at the memories of the terrible tragedy in Odessa, where peaceful protesters were brutally murdered, burned alive in the House of Trade Unions. The criminals who committed that atrocity have never been punished, and no one is even looking for them. But we know their names and we will do everything to punish them, find them and bring them to justice. Maidan did not bring Ukraine any closer to democracy and progress. Having accomplished a coup d'état, the nationalists and those political forces that supported them eventually led Ukraine into an impasse, pushed the country into the abyss of civil war. Eight years later, the country is split. Ukraine is struggling with an acute socioeconomic crisis. According to international organisations, in 2019, almost 6 million Ukrainians– I emphasise– about 15 percent, not of the wokrforce, but of the entire population of that country, had to go abroad to find work. Most of them do odd jobs. The following fact is also revealing: since 2020, over 60,000 doctors and other health workers have left the country amid the pandemic. Since 2014, water bills increased by almost a third, and energy bills grew several times, while the price of gas for households surged several dozen times. Many people simply do not have the money to pay for utilities. They literally struggle to survive. What happened? Why is this all happening? The answer is obvious. They spent and embezzled the legacy inherited not only from the Soviet era, but also from the Russian Empire. They lost tens, hundreds of thousands of jobs which enabled people to earn a reliable income and generate tax revenue, among other things thanks to close cooperation with Russia. Sectors including machine building, instrument engineering, electronics, ship and aircraft building have been undermined or destroyed altogether. There was a time, however, when not only Ukraine, but the entire Soviet Union took pride in these companies. In 2021, the Black Sea Shipyard in Nikolayev went out of business. Its first docks date back to Catherine the Great. Antonov, the famous manufacturer, has not made a single commercial aircraft since 2016, while Yuzhmash, a factory specialising in missile and space equipment, is nearly bankrupt. The Kremenchug Steel Plant is in a similar situation. This sad list goes on and on. As for the gas transportation system, it was built in its entirety by the Soviet Union, and it has now deteriorated to an extent that using it creates major risks and comes at a high cost for the environment. This situation begs the question: poverty, lack of opportunity, and lost industrial and technological potential– is this the pro-Western civilisational choice they have been using for many years to fool millions of people with promises of heavenly pastures? It all came down to a Ukrainian economy in tatters and an outright pillage of the country's citizens, while Ukraine itself was placed under external control, directed not only from the Western capitals, but also on the ground, as the saying goes, through an entire network of foreign advisors, NGOs and other institutions present in Ukraine. They have a direct bearing on all the key appointments and dismissals and on all branches of power at all levels, from the central government down to municipalities, as well as on state-owned companies and corporations, including Naftogaz, Ukrenergo, Ukrainian Railways, Ukroboronprom, Ukrposhta, and the Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority. There is no independent judiciary in Ukraine. The Kiev authorities, at the West's demand, delegated the priority right to select members of the supreme judicial bodies, the Council of Justice and the High Qualifications Commission of Judges, to international organisations. In addition, the United States directly controls the National Agency on Corruption Prevention, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau, the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office and the High Anti-Corruption Court. All this is done under the noble pretext of invigorating efforts against corruption. All right, but where are the results? Corruption is flourishing like never before. Are the Ukrainian people aware that this is how their country is managed? Do they realise that their country has turned not even into a political or economic protectorate but has been reduced to a colony with a puppet regime? The state was privatised. As a result, the government, which designates itself as the""power of patriots"" no longer acts in a national capacity and consistently pushes Ukraine towards losing its sovereignty. The policy to root out the Russian language and culture and promote assimilation carries on. The Verkhovna Rada has generated a steady flow of discriminatory bills, and the law on the so-called indigenous people has already come into force. People who identify as Russians and want to preserve their identity, language and culture are getting the signal that they are not wanted in Ukraine. Under the laws on education and the Ukrainian language as a state language, the Russian language has no place in schools or public spaces, even in ordinary shops. The law on the so-called vetting of officials and purging their ranks created a pathway for dealing with unwanted civil servants. There are more and more acts enabling the Ukrainian military and law enforcement agencies to crack down on the freedom of speech, dissent, and going after the opposition. The world knows the deplorable practice of imposing unilateral illegitimate sanctions against other countries, foreign individuals and legal entities. Ukraine has outperformed its Western masters by inventing sanctions against its own citizens, companies, television channels, other media outlets and even members of parliament. Kiev continues to prepare the destruction of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate. This is not an emotional judgement; proof of this can be found in concrete decisions and documents. The Ukrainian authorities have cynically turned the tragedy of the schism into an instrument of state policy. The current authorities do not react to the Ukrainian people's appeals to abolish the laws that are infringing on believers' rights. Moreover, new draft laws directed against the clergy and millions of parishioners of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate have been registered in the Verkhovna Rada. A few words about Crimea. The people of the peninsula freely made their choice to be with Russia. The Kiev authorities cannot challenge the clearly stated choice of the people, which is why they have opted for aggressive action, for activating extremist cells, including radical Islamist organisations, for sending subversives to stage terrorist attacks at critical infrastructure facilities, and for kidnapping Russian citizens. We have factual proof that such aggressive actions are being taken with support from Western security services. In March 2021, a new Military Strategy was adopted in Ukraine. This document is almost entirely dedicated to confrontation with Russia and sets the goal of involving foreign states in a conflict with our country. The strategy stipulates the organisation of what can be described as a terrorist underground movement in Russia's Crimea and in Donbass. It also sets out the contours of a potential war, which should end, according to the Kiev strategists,""with the assistance of the international community on favourable terms for Ukraine,"" as well as– listen carefully, please–""with foreign military support in the geopolitical confrontation with the Russian Federation."" In fact, this is nothing other than preparation for hostilities against our country, Russia. As we know, it has already been stated today that Ukraine intends to create its own nuclear weapons, and this is not just bragging. Ukraine has the nuclear technologies created back in the Soviet times and delivery vehicles for such weapons, including aircraft, as well as the Soviet-designed Tochka-U precision tactical missiles with a range of over 100 kilometres. But they can do more; it is only a matter of time. They have had the groundwork for this since the Soviet era. In other words, acquiring tactical nuclear weapons will be much easier for Ukraine than for some other states I am not going to mention here, which are conducting such research, especially if Kiev receives foreign technological support. We cannot rule this out either. If Ukraine acquires weapons of mass destruction, the situation in the world and in Europe will drastically change, especially for us, for Russia. We cannot but react to this real danger, all the more so since, let me repeat, Ukraine's Western patrons may help it acquire these weapons to create yet another threat to our country. We are seeing how persistently the Kiev regime is being pumped with arms. Since 2014, the United States alone has spent billions of dollars for this purpose, including supplies of arms and equipment and training of specialists. In the last few months, there has been a constant flow of Western weapons to Ukraine, ostentatiously, with the entire world watching. Foreign advisors supervise the activities of Ukraine's armed forces and special services and we are well aware of this. Over the past few years, military contingents of NATO countries have been almost constantly present on Ukrainian territory under the pretext of exercises. The Ukrainian troop control system has already been integrated into NATO. This means that NATO headquarters can issue direct commands to the Ukrainian armed forces, even to their separate units and squads. The United States and NATO have started an impudent development of Ukrainian territory as a theatre of potential military operations. Their regular joint exercises are obviously anti-Russian. Last year alone, over 23,000 troops and more than a thousand units of hardware were involved. A law has already been adopted that allows foreign troops to come to Ukraine in 2022 to take part in multinational drills. Understandably, these are primarily NATO troops. This year, at least ten of these joint drills are planned. Obviously, such undertakings are designed to be a cover-up for a rapid buildup of the NATO military group on Ukrainian territory. This is all the more so since the network of airfields upgraded with US help in Borispol, Ivano-Frankovsk, Chuguyev and Odessa, to name a few, is capable of transferring army units in a very short time. Ukraine's airspace is open to flights by US strategic and reconnaissance aircraft and drones that conduct surveillance over Russian territory. I will add that the US-built Maritime Operations Centre in Ochakov makes it possible to support activity by NATO warships, including the use of precision weapons, against the Russian Black Sea Fleet and our infrastructure on the entire Black Sea Coast. At one time, the United States intended to build similar facilities in Crimea as well but the Crimeans and residents of Sevastopol wrecked these plans. We will always remember this. I would like to repeat that today such a centre has already been deployed in Ochakov. In the 18th century, soldiers of Alexander Suvorov fought for this city. Owing to their courage, it became part of Russia. Also in the 18th century, the lands of the Black Sea littoral, incorporated in Russia as a result of wars with the Ottoman Empire, were given the name of Novorossiya(New Russia). Now attempts are being made to condemn these landmarks of history to oblivion, along with the names of state and military figures of the Russian Empire without whose efforts modern Ukraine would not have many big cities or even access to the Black Sea. A monument to Alexander Suvorov was recently demolished in Poltava. What is there to say? Are you renouncing your own past? The so-called colonial heritage of the Russian Empire? Well, in this case, be consistent. Next, notably, Article 17 of the Constitution of Ukraine stipulates that deploying foreign military bases on its territory is illegal. However, as it turns out, this is just a conventionality that can be easily circumvented. Ukraine is home to NATO training missions which are, in fact, foreign military bases. They just called a base a mission and were done with it. Kiev has long proclaimed a strategic course on joining NATO. Indeed, each country is entitled to pick its own security system and enter into military alliances. There would be no problem with that, if it were not for one""but."" International documents expressly stipulate the principle of equal and indivisible security, which includes obligations not to strengthen one's own security at the expense of the security of other states. This is stated in the 1999 OSCE Charter for European Security adopted in Istanbul and the 2010 OSCE Astana Declaration. In other words, the choice of pathways towards ensuring security should not pose a threat to other states, whereas Ukraine joining NATO is a direct threat to Russia's security. Let me remind you that at the Bucharest NATO summit held in April 2008, the United States pushed through a decision to the effect that Ukraine and, by the way, Georgia would become NATO members. Many European allies of the United States were well aware of the risks associated with this prospect already then, but were forced to put up with the will of their senior partner. The Americans simply used them to carry out a clearly anti-Russian policy. A number of NATO member states are still very sceptical about Ukraine joining NATO. We are getting signals from some European capitals telling us not to worry since it will not happen literally overnight. In fact, our US partners are saying the same thing as well.""All right, then"" we respond,""if it does not happen tomorrow, then it will happen the day after tomorrow. What does it change from the historical perspective? Nothing at all."" Furthermore, we are aware of the US leadership's position and words that active hostilities in eastern Ukraine do not rule out the possibility of that country joining NATO if it meets NATO criteria and overcomes corruption. All the while, they are trying to convince us over and over again that NATO is a peace-loving and purely defensive alliance that poses no threat to Russia. Again, they want us to take their word for it. But we are well aware of the real value of these words. In 1990, when German unification was discussed, the United States promised the Soviet leadership that NATO jurisdiction or military presence will not expand one inch to the east and that the unification of Germany will not lead to the spread of NATO's military organisation to the east. This is a quote. They issued lots of verbal assurances, all of which turned out to be empty phrases. Later, they began to assure us that the accession to NATO by Central and Eastern European countries would only improve relations with Moscow, relieve these countries of the fears steeped in their bitter historical legacy, and even create a belt of countries that are friendly towards Russia. However, the exact opposite happened. The governments of certain Eastern European countries, speculating on Russophobia, brought their complexes and stereotypes about the Russian threat to the Alliance and insisted on building up the collective defence potentials and deploying them primarily against Russia. Worse still, that happened in the 1990s and the early 2000s when, thanks to our openness and goodwill, relations between Russia and the West had reached a high level. Russia has fulfilled all of its obligations, including the pullout from Germany, from Central and Eastern Europe, making an immense contribution to overcoming the legacy of the Cold War. We have consistently proposed various cooperation options, including in the NATO-Russia Council and the OSCE formats. Moreover, I will say something I have never said publicly, I will say it now for the first time. When then outgoing US President Bill Clinton visited Moscow in 2000, I asked him how America would feel about admitting Russia to NATO. I will not reveal all the details of that conversation, but the reaction to my question was, let us say, quite restrained, and the Americans' true attitude to that possibility can actually be seen from their subsequent steps with regard to our country. I am referring to the overt support for terrorists in the North Caucasus, the disregard for our security demands and concerns, NATO's continued expansion, withdrawal from the ABM Treaty, and so on. It raises the question: why? What is all this about, what is the purpose? All right, you do not want to see us as friends or allies, but why make us an enemy? There can be only one answer– this is not about our political regime or anything like that. They just do not need a big and independent country like Russia around. This is the answer to all questions. This is the source of America's traditional policy towards Russia. Hence the attitude to all our security proposals Today, one glance at the map is enough to see to what extent Western countries have kept their promise to refrain from NATO's eastward expansion. They just cheated. We have seen five waves of NATO expansion, one after another– Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary were admitted in 1999; Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia in 2004; Albania and Croatia in 2009; Montenegro in 2017; and North Macedonia in 2020. As a result, the Alliance, its military infrastructure has reached Russia's borders. This is one of the key causes of the European security crisis; it has had the most negative impact on the entire system of international relations and led to the loss of mutual trust. The situation continues to deteriorate, including in the strategic area. Thus, positioning areas for interceptor missiles are being established in Romania and Poland as part of the US project to create a global missile defence system. It is common knowledge that the launchers deployed there can be used for Tomahawk cruise missiles– offensive strike systems. In addition, the United States is developing its all-purpose Standard Missile-6, which can provide air and missile defence, as well as strike ground and surface targets. In other words, the allegedly defensive US missile defence system is developing and expanding its new offensive capabilities. The information we have gives us good reason to believe that Ukraine's accession to NATO and the subsequent deployment of NATO facilities has already been decided and is only a matter of time. We clearly understand that given this scenario, the level of military threats to Russia will increase dramatically, several times over. And I would like to emphasise at this point that the risk of a sudden strike at our country will multiply. I will explain that American strategic planning documents confirm the possibility of a so-called preemptive strike at enemy missile systems. We also know the main adversary of the United States and NATO. It is Russia. NATO documents officially declare our country to be the main threat to Euro-Atlantic security. Ukraine will serve as an advanced bridgehead for such a strike. If our ancestors heard about this, they would probably simply not believe this. We do not want to believe this today either, but it is what it is. I would like people in Russia and Ukraine to understand this. Many Ukrainian airfields are located not far from our borders. NATO's tactical aviation deployed there, including precision weapon carriers, will be capable of striking at our territory to the depth of the Volgograd-Kazan-Samara-Astrakhan line. The deployment of reconnaissance radars on Ukrainian territory will allow NATO to tightly control Russia's airspace up to the Urals. Finally, after the US destroyed the INF Treaty, the Pentagon has been openly developing many land-based attack weapons, including ballistic missiles that are capable of hitting targets at a distance of up to 5,500 km. If deployed in Ukraine, such systems will be able to hit targets in Russia's entire European part. The flying time of Tomahawk cruise missiles to Moscow will be less than 35 minutes; ballistic missiles from Kharkov will take seven to eight minutes; and hypersonic assault weapons, four to five minutes. It is like a knife to the throat. I have no doubt that they hope to carry out these plans, as they did many times in the past, expanding NATO eastward, moving their military infrastructure to Russian borders and fully ignoring our concerns, protests and warnings. Excuse me, but they simply did not care at all about such things and did whatever they deemed necessary. Of course, they are going to behave in the same way in the future, following a well-known proverb:""The dogs bark but the caravan goes on."" Let me say right away– we do not accept this behaviour and will never accept it. That said, Russia has always advocated the resolution of the most complicated problems by political and diplomatic means, at the negotiating table. We are well aware of our enormous responsibility when it comes to regional and global stability. Back in 2008, Russia put forth an initiative to conclude a European Security Treaty under which not a single Euro-Atlantic state or international organisation could strengthen their security at the expense of the security of others. However, our proposal was rejected right off the bat on the pretext that Russia should not be allowed to put limits on NATO activities. Furthermore, it was made explicitly clear to us that only NATO members can have legally binding security guarantees. Last December, we handed over to our Western partners a draft treaty between the Russian Federation and the United States of America on security guarantees, as well as a draft agreement on measures to ensure the security of the Russian Federation and NATO member states. The United States and NATO responded with general statements. There were kernels of rationality in them as well, but they concerned matters of secondary importance and it all looked like an attempt to drag the issue out and to lead the discussion astray. We responded to this accordingly and pointed out that we were ready to follow the path of negotiations, provided, however, that all issues are considered as a package that includes Russia's core proposals which contain three key points. First, to prevent further NATO expansion. Second, to have the Alliance refrain from deploying assault weapon systems on Russian borders. And finally, rolling back the bloc's military capability and infrastructure in Europe to where they were in 1997, when the NATO-Russia Founding Act was signed. These principled proposals of ours have been ignored. To reiterate, our Western partners have once again vocalised the all-too-familiar formulas that each state is entitled to freely choose ways to ensure its security or to join any military union or alliance. That is, nothing has changed in their stance, and we keep hearing the same old references to NATO's notorious""open door"" policy. Moreover, they are again trying to blackmail us and are threatening us with sanctions, which, by the way, they will introduce no matter what as Russia continues to strengthen its sovereignty and its Armed Forces. To be sure, they will never think twice before coming up with or just fabricating a pretext for yet another sanction attack regardless of the developments in Ukraine. Their one and only goal is to hold back the development of Russia. And they will keep doing so, just as they did before, even without any formal pretext just because we exist and will never compromise our sovereignty, national interests or values. I would like to be clear and straightforward: in the current circumstances, when our proposals for an equal dialogue on fundamental issues have actually remained unanswered by the United States and NATO, when the level of threats to our country has increased significantly, Russia has every right to respond in order to ensure its security. That is exactly what we will do. With regard to the state of affairs in Donbass, we see that the ruling Kiev elites never stop publicly making clear their unwillingness to comply with the Minsk Package of Measures to settle the conflict and are not interested in a peaceful settlement. On the contrary, they are trying to orchestrate a blitzkrieg in Donbass as was the case in 2014 and 2015. We all know how these reckless schemes ended. Not a single day goes by without Donbass communities coming under shelling attacks. The recently formed large military force makes use of attack drones, heavy equipment, missiles, artillery and multiple rocket launchers. The killing of civilians, the blockade, the abuse of people, including children, women and the elderly, continues unabated. As we say, there is no end in sight to this. Meanwhile, the so-called civilised world, which our Western colleagues proclaimed themselves the only representatives of, prefers not to see this, as if this horror and genocide, which almost 4 million people are facing, do not exist. But they do exist and only because these people did not agree with the West-supported coup in Ukraine in 2014 and opposed the transition towards the Neanderthal and aggressive nationalism and neo-Nazism which have been elevated in Ukraine to the rank of national policy. They are fighting for their elementary right to live on their own land, to speak their own language, and to preserve their culture and traditions. How long can this tragedy continue? How much longer can one put up with this? Russia has done everything to preserve Ukraine's territorial integrity. All these years, it has persistently and patiently pushed for the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2202 of February 17, 2015, which consolidated the Minsk Package of Measures of February 12, 2015, to settle the situation in Donbass. Everything was in vain. Presidents and Rada deputies come and go, but deep down the aggressive and nationalistic regime that seized power in Kiev remains unchanged. It is entirely a product of the 2014 coup, and those who then embarked on the path of violence, bloodshed and lawlessness did not recognise then and do not recognise now any solution to the Donbass issue other than a military one. In this regard, I consider it necessary to take a long overdue decision and to immediately recognise the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic. I would like to ask the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation to support this decision and then ratify the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance with both republics. These two documents will be prepared and signed shortly. We want those who seized and continue to hold power in Kiev to immediately stop hostilities. Otherwise, the responsibility for the possible continuation of the bloodshed will lie entirely on the conscience of Ukraine's ruling regime. As I announce the decisions taken today, I remain confident in the support of Russia's citizens and the country's patriotic forces. Thank you."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67825,Security Council meeting,2022-02-21T18:30:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",The President held a meeting of the Russian Federation Security Council at the Kremlin.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues. We are meeting today to discuss the current developments in Donbass. I will briefly remind you how it all started and how the situation has developed even though you know this very well. But we need general background to help us make appropriate decisions. So, after the 2014 coup in Ukraine, part of the population did not accept the outcome. Let me remind you that this was an anti-constitutional, blood-shedding coup that killed many innocent people. It was truly an armed coup. Nobody can argue that. Some of the country's citizens did not accept the coup. They were residents of Crimea and the people who currently live in Donbass. Those people declared that they were establishing two independent republics, the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic. This was the point when the confrontation started between the Kiev officials and the people living on that territory. In this context, I would like to point out that Russia initially did everything it could to make sure these disagreements could be resolved by peaceful means. However, the Kiev officials have conducted two punitive operations on those territories and, apparently, we are witnessing a third escalation. All these years – I want to stress this – all these years, the people living on those territories have been literally tortured by constant shelling and blockades. As you know, the people living on those territories, close to the front line, so to speak, were in fact forced to seek shelter in their basements – where they now live with their children. A peace plan was drafted during the negotiating process called the Minsk Package of Measures because, as you recall, we met in the city of Minsk. But subsequent developments show that the Kiev authorities are not planning to implement it, and they have publicly said so many times at the top state level and at the level of Foreign Minister and Security Council Secretary. Overall, everyone understands that they are not planning to do anything with regard to this Minsk Package of Measures. Nevertheless, Russia has exerted efforts and still continues to make efforts to resolve all the complicated aspects and tragic developments by peaceful means, but we have what we have. Our goal, the goal of today's meeting is to listen to our colleagues and to outline future steps in this direction, considering the appeals by the leaders of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic on recognising their sovereignty, as well as a resolution by the State Duma of the Russian Federation on the same subject. The latter document urges the President to recognise the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic. At the same time, I would like to note that these different matters are, nevertheless, closely linked with matters of maintaining international security, on the European continent in particular, because the use of Ukraine as a tool for confronting this country, Russia, of course, presents a major and serious threat to us. This is why we have intensified our work with our main partners in Washington and NATO over the past few months and in late 2021, so as to reach an eventual agreement on these security measures and to ensure the country's calm and successful development under peaceful conditions. We see this as our number one objective and a top priority; instead of confrontation, we need to maintain security and ensure conditions for our development. But we must, of course, understand the reality we live in. And, as I have said many times before, if Russia faces the threat of Ukraine being accepted into the North Atlantic Alliance, NATO, the threat against our country will increase because of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty that clearly states that all countries in the alliance must fight on the side of their co-member in the event of an aggression against it. But since nobody recognises the will expressed by the people of Crimea and Sevastopol, and Ukraine continues to insist that it is Ukrainian territory, there is a real threat that they will try to take back the territory they believe is theirs using military force. And they do say this in their documents, obviously. Then the entire North Atlantic Alliance will have to get involved. As you know, we have been told that some NATO countries are against Ukraine becoming a member. However, despite their objections, in 2008, they signed a memorandum in Bucharest that opened the doors for Ukraine and Georgia to join NATO. I have not received an answer to my question as to why they did that. But if they took one step under pressure from the United States, who can guarantee that they will not take another step under pressure? There is no guarantee. There are no guarantees whatsoever because the United States is known to easily discard any agreements and documents it signs. Still, at least something must be put on paper and formulated as an international legal act. At this point, we cannot even agree on this one thing. Therefore, I would like to suggest that we proceed as follows: first, I will give the floor to Mr Lavrov who is directly involved in the attempts to reach an agreement with Washington and Brussels, and with NATO, on security guarantees. Then I would like Mr Kozak to report on his findings concerning the talks on the implementation of the Minsk agreements. Then each of you will be able to speak. But at the end of the day, we must decide what we will do next and how we should proceed in view of the current situation and our assessment of these developments. Mr Lavrov, please. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov Lavrov SergeiForeign Minister of Russia : Mr President, colleagues, As I reported to the President a week ago, we prepared our assessment of the proposals on the security guarantees that Russia submitted for consideration by the United States and NATO last December. We received their response in late January. The assessment of this response shows that our Western colleagues are not prepared to take up our major proposals, primarily those on NATO's eastward non-expansion. This demand was rejected with reference to the bloc's so-called open-door policy and the freedom of each state to choose its own way of ensuring security. Neither the United States, not the North Atlantic Alliance proposed an alternative to this key provision. The United States is doing everything it can to avoid the principle of indivisibility of security that we consider of fundamental importance and to which we have made many references. Deriving from it the only element that suits them – the freedom to choose alliances – they completely ignore everything else, including the key condition that reads that nobody – either in choosing alliances or regardless of them – is allowed to enhance their security at the expense of the security of others. In this context, I sent our Western European colleagues that are part of NATO, EU members, plus Switzerland, detailed letters with our legal analysis of the commitments that the OSCE assumed at the top level in 1999 and 2010, as well as within the framework of Russia-NATO relations, including the 1997 Founding Act and the Rome Declaration, that the participants in the Russia-NATO meeting in Pratica di Mare approved at the top level in 2002. Our second priority concerns the time we established relations with NATO, in 1997. Considering that the 1997 documents declared that Russia and NATO were no longer opponents and were supposed, in part, to develop a strategic partnership, we suggested returning to the 1997 configuration of NATO forces on the eastern flank. This argument was rejected, like the first one. Indicatively, in their response, some NATO countries immediately urged us to stop ""the occupation of Crimea"" and ""withdraw our troops from the territories of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine."" In general, these documents expressed support for the Minsk Package of Measures, but this support was absolutely ""sterile."" It did not evince any readiness to compel Kiev to implement the provisions of this most important document. In response to our other demands, including the need to rule out the deployment of arms systems that threaten us near our borders, the Americans expressed the desire to start discussing land-based medium- and short-range missiles. This issue emerged after the United States unilaterally walked out of the relevant treaty with the Russian Federation and ignored, Mr President, your initiatives of two years ago. At that time, you suggested replacing the treaty with at least a declaration on a mutual moratorium on deploying these systems with the relevant verification measures. In the proposals we have received, the United States and NATO are also suggesting efforts in certain aspects of reducing military risks and on increasing transparency and predictability. These ideas are very close to the proposals we have repeatedly presented to both the Americans and to NATO. However, these issues were removed, separated from the context of the package agreement on security guarantees. As for bilateral steps, the United States suggests regulating flights of strategic bombers, completing the work on measures to prevent incidents at sea and in the airspace over the sea. It is paying special attention to the transparency of surprise inspections, the resumption of contacts between the militaries, the creation of a civilian hotline, and a discussion of mechanisms to prevent dangerous military incidents. Overall, our general impression is that our colleagues are trying to separate, as it were, Russia's proposals, to single out from them some secondary, albeit important for us, points that can help maintain the dialogue and risk reduction but that will not affect the vital interests of the US and its allies in their unlimited expansion of NATO, and that will not limit their freedom to define the configuration of forces in the NATO space and around it. That said, and this is particularly important in the context of the issue that the President outlined today, the beginning of a dialogue on any issue is contingent on our preliminary steps to deescalate tensions around Ukraine. In evaluating these responses, we can say that we see some progress. These openings are small but they do exist. The consistency and principled approach that we have been displaying in promoting our initiatives since last December have, of course, shaken the United States and its allies and have compelled them to start working on many Russian proposals on the reduction of military tensions and arms control, which they ignored before. As I reported to you, Mr President, in this context we believe it is necessary to continue this work. We responded in detail, in the spirit I described, to the documents from Washington and Brussels, but we have sent our response only to the United States for now, partly, primarily because we see NATO's role as ancillary since they would determine their steps mainly, maybe even exclusively based on Washington's policies. By the way, at the recent Munich Security Conference, every Western representative declared their absolute commitment to a unified approach. That unified approach was developed by the United States, so Munich has simply confirmed that we need to negotiate with Washington. This is what we are doing now, sending the response that you approved to the American document. We believe we have clearly emphasised the most important part – that our proposals are not an a la carte menu to choose from, but they are not an ultimatum either. They actually stem from the absolutely obvious point that the global situation can only be resolved through a comprehensive approach at this stage. You, Mr President, have stressed that the Ukrainian crisis also largely depends on how relations develop between the Russian Federation and the West, led by the United States, so in our response, we underscored the integrity of the original Russian initiative. We are also ready to discuss the matters that the Americans have recalled, including taking into account our previous proposals. But again, we will do this solely as part of addressing our main concerns: stopping NATO's eastward expansion and considering the configuration of NATO's presence on the European continent, primarily in Central and Eastern Europe, in line with the previous Russia–NATO agreements. Naturally, our call is not a call but rather a demand, by and large, to explain why the assurances signed at the highest level that no one is to strengthen their security at the expense of others are now being ignored, and more than that, our colleagues from the respective countries are even refusing to explain what they had in mind when their leaders signed the relevant documents, and why now, regardless of what they had in mind, they are not going to fulfill their obligations. Following your instruction, Mr President, we have sent these documents to Washington. A couple of days later, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken called me to say he had read our document and was ready to meet to discuss it, convey the American reaction and possibly ask some additional questions. With your consent, the meeting has been scheduled for later this week, February 24, in Geneva. We will be guided by the approach that you have approved, the one you defend during the meetings with your colleagues, and which we will certainly promote at the Foreign Ministry level. Vladimir Putin: I am talking to my colleagues about this in fact, and my American colleague has assured me that they are not going to admit Ukraine tomorrow; moreover, even a moratorium is possible. But they also believe that Ukraine is not ready yet, so my answer was simple: ""We do not see this as a concession to us; it is just the implementation of your plans. You believe you need to wait and prepare Ukraine for joining NATO. A moratorium, but not a moratorium for us; you are announcing this moratorium for yourself. So where is the step towards us, to meet us halfway? So far, we have not seen this."" I spoke twice to the President of France yesterday; actually, we spoke until 2 am this morning, so you could say we talked today. He insists that the US position has undergone some changes. But regrettably, he was unable to answer the question of what those changes are. I think first we need to see what these changes are, if they exist at all, because your colleagues, to the contrary, publicly claimed as late as yesterday that there were no changes in the principal issues of expansion, of accepting new countries into NATO, including Ukraine. Do I understand it correctly? Sergey Lavrov: Yes, Mr President, despite the multiplying publications of classified documents – and in the Western media at that – that were discussed by our Western colleagues in the early 90s both among themselves and with us; and even though they clearly indicated that even the West has no intention of expanding NATO to the east, confirming that in talks in a narrow circle; regardless of that, Mr Stoltenberg, the current Secretary General of the North Atlantic Alliance, is still rejecting obvious facts that have been declassified by a British archive and published by Spiegel magazine. Despite all that, they are adamant in not weakening their ""open door"" policy, even though you have explained several times that such a policy does not actually exist. There is the possibility under the Washington Treaty of proposing, with unanimous consent from the NATO countries, that a given country join the alliance under two conditions: if it meets the membership qualifications, and secondly, and most importantly, if that country can add a security dimension to the North Atlantic Alliance. We know, of course, that the second critical criteria has long been ignored by NATO. As to what new ideas the Americans and their allies can offer, we presume that, as you said to President Macron, we first have to understand what the Americans mean. Because our French colleagues tell us that they have an understanding of what Washington can speak to us about. As you agreed with President Macron yesterday, I will have a telephone conversation with the French Foreign Minister today. When we were scheduling the call, I asked the French Foreign Ministry to make sure that he clarifies, even if just a little, what the Americans are ready to discuss with us as they hinted to the French. Vladimir Putin: I see, thank you. Take your seat, please, Thank you. Now, Mr Kozak will report – as I requested – on any developments on the Minsk settlement track, let us call it that. And after that, I would ask the other Security Council members to speak out starting with the real situation, which is now unfolding in the Donetsk People's Republic. Please, Mr Kozak. Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Dmitry Kozak Kozak DmitryDeputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office : Mr President, colleagues, I will not bore you with the details of the difficult and extremely complicated talks on implementing the Minsk agreements. I will only say that today it has become absolutely obvious that Ukraine and its Western allies do not need Donbass on any conditions. Everything is being done to freeze this conflict and to shift political responsibility onto the Russian Federation. They have already persuaded the public at large, including Ukrainian and Western public opinion, that Russia assumes such responsibility, that it is a party to the conflict, and that this is solely a Russian-Ukrainian international conflict. They also want Russia to assume economic responsibility for supporting Donbass. You are well aware, as many people are, that we have to spend astronomical sums on humanitarian aid for those territories. I would also like to say that everything that is happening in those territories is reflected in the latest statistics that we received today. Admittedly, we do not always act consistently. However, our measures and the Government's programme gave a boost to economic activity in Donbass, the number of jobs soared, and unemployment plunged. Today, the region is facing labour shortages, and the number of vacancies exceeds that of jobless persons 2.5 times over. Here is another fact: relocation incentives and the issue of Russian passports run counter to our economic goals. But this is just a comment. Speaking of Ukraine, it is completely obvious that neither Ukraine, nor the West needs Donbass, they do not want to resolve the conflict; on the contrary, they want to freeze it. They go into a stupor when they hear any hypothetical questions on whether they would like to reintegrate Donbass in Ukraine, so that the government of Ukraine regains control over it on some conditions. They do not know how to answer this question, and they simply keep silent and avert their eyes. As far as Donbass is concerned, there is probably no need to explain the political and economic reasons that … Vladimir Putin: No-no, please, tell us about the negotiating process on the Minsk agreements and its current status. Dmitry Kozak: Its status has remained at zero level since 2015. Let me remind you that, in accordance with the Minsk Package of Measures, a dialogue on the future regime and the status of Donbass as part of post-conflict Ukraine was supposed to have started the day after the withdrawal of heavy weapons. This withdrawal was completed on March 8, 2015. The dialogue was to have officially begun March 9, while the amendments to the Constitution drafted during this dialogue and coordinated with Donbass, as well as a permanent law on the special status were to have entered into effect by late 2015. This should have been followed by local elections held in accordance with to this status and the settlement of the conflict, with the Russian-Ukrainian border subsequently put under Ukraine's control. This is what should have taken place. But the dialogue never started. Ukraine has kept its notion of Donbass' status a deep secret. Obviously, the talks indicate that Ukraine views these areas as its ordinary municipal regions with traditional rights and authority, without any special status. They have already succeeded in persuading the Ukrainian people that this part of the Minsk agreements is unacceptable. If such a precedent is set, with a certain territory with a special status, special authority and the right to language self-determination, plus its own police as well as its influence on Ukraine's law-enforcement system, this precedent will be applied to the country's other regions as well. Such a demand for federalisation or autonomy of Ukraine's certain regions indeed exists, particularly in the country's western territories. They have convinced all of Ukraine of it, and they are going to pursue it. During the Minsk negotiations and in other international formats, they claimed that they are committed to the Minsk agreements, but as soon as they leave the negotiation room, they publicly state that the Minsk agreements are unacceptable, they are a 'noose around their necks' and hinder the settlement of the Donbass conflict. Vladimir Putin: As I have already mentioned, yesterday I spoke with my French counterpart once again. He claims that Ukraine's incumbent leadership is ready to implement the Minsk agreements and is even introducing certain new constructive ideas on their implementation, such as an election under the arrangement used for the election of German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Dmitry Kozak: I am saying once again that they have already learned lessons in the past eight years. They have often found themselves in a foolish and absolutely comical situation, and they are openly lying. And these Minsk Agreements, all the documents that have been submitted today by the Contact Group and in the Normandy Format are being interpreted differently. When they see the word ""black,"" they say it means ""white."" I have repeatedly said that, maybe, some passages are written using invisible milk ink; so, let's use a hot iron to see the ink. Here is the latest graphic example. On September 17, 2021, they said Russia was a party to the conflict. We told them to write down that Russia was a party to the conflict, as well as obligations it should fulfil under the Minsk Agreements as a party to the conflict. They replied that they knew nothing about these obligations. I approached the Ukrainians saying that they considered Russia an aggressor, and I asked them whether they could formulate their position and thus help the Germans and the French. They replied that they would prefer the French and the Germans to do this. In the long run, the French and the Germans said that it would be better if Russia invented its own obligations under the Minsk Agreements, and that they knew nothing about them. Here is another example. I told them that, to make things easier for them, it was necessary to establish what provisions of the Minsk Agreements Donbass was complying with or not complying with. The thing is that Donbass adopted an offensive position and submitted a multitude of proposals on fulfilling the Minsk Agreements. They said they did not know what provisions Donbass was failing to comply with, that they were unable to formulate this aspect, and that Russia should invent something instead. Vladimir Putin: Meaning we don't know what? We don't know what provisions of the Minsk Agreements Donbass is not complying with. Dmitry Kozak: Yes, of course. They have no position on any matter. They don't know what obligations Russia should assume, and what obligations Donbass should fulfil or refuses to fulfil. Vladimir Putin: Please explain once again about Clauses 9, 11 and 12 stating expressly that decisions should be taken in dialogue with … Dmitry Kozak: During consultations and discussions. Vladimir Putin: During consultations and in dialogue with these republics. What do you have to say on this matter? Dmitry Kozak: They believe that, contrary to what is written there (quite possibly, they had to bring the Cambridge English Dictionary to Berlin the last time), this requirement does not imply direct dialogue. Discussions and consultations do not mean direct dialogue between Donbass and Kiev on political aspects of the peace settlement. Vladimir Putin: Do you mean that, in their opinion, the provision reading ""during dialogue and by agreement"" does not mean direct dialogue? Dmitry Kozak: Yes. Yesterday, President Macron told you that it was necessary to conduct this dialogue solely within the framework of the Trilateral Contact Group and under OSCE supervision. This, too, is a far-fetched problem because this dialogue is taking place exclusively within the framework of the OSCE-moderated Trilateral Contact Group. This is a far-fetched problem that does not exist. All of Donbass' proposals are submitted to the Trilateral Contact Group via the OSCE, and everyone is trying to discuss them under the auspices of the OSCE. But when Donbass representatives say anything, Ukrainian representatives turn away and do not hear them. When asked to reply, they say that they will reply if Russia asks them something. When Russia enquired as to when the Ukrainians would amend the Constitution under the Minsk Agreements (this took place about two years ago in Berlin), the very next day, Ukraine threw such a tantrum, claiming that Russia was interfering in Ukraine's domestic affairs, and that it was making categorical demands for amendments to be made to Ukraine's Constitution. ""This is the sovereign right of Ukraine, and no one has the right to interfere in this."" Vladimir Putin: Do we understand you correctly thatthe Kiev authorities do not want to talk to the republics directly? They say they intend to do this in dialogue with Russia, but as soon as Russia suggests steps towards settlement as part of the Minsk Agreements, they throw a tantrum, claiming that Russia is interfering in Ukraine's internal affairs? Dmitry Kozak: Yes, this is obvious. Absolutely. They are pushing us to respond and start suggesting something regarding political terms, and after that, they would begin accusing us of interference. Vladimir Putin: Yes. And what about [their claim] that the Minsk Agreements should be interpreted in such a way that it is the current Kiev official authorities, rather than the unrecognised republics, that should introduce initiatives and proposals on how to implement the Minsk Package of Measures? Dmitry Kozak: Yet another recent proposal that emerged in Berlin on February 10 was a specimen of legal cretinism. Since the case in point is Ukraine's legislation, the initiatives on amending its laws should come solely from Ukraine. All right, the initiatives are coming. But if the proposals or amendments to these initiatives are outlandish, like Ukraine's delirious proposals you were discussing with President Macron yesterday, and if Donbass suggests some alternative proposals, will they be considered? ""We do not know,"" they say and lower their eyes. Obviously, this is the entirety of their latest tactics – they are showing their ingenuity. It is silly, awkward and ridiculous, but they display it constantly, improvising new schemes as they proceed. The gist of the matter is that no one can discuss Ukrainian proposals on amending their Constitution and laws because this is the sovereign right of Ukraine. If Russia wants to do it, this is a case of Russia interfering in their internal affairs, if Donbass wants to – they are separatists, who have no right either. This is the stand taken by Ukraine, which France unexpectedly supported yesterday. Vladimir Putin: Do I understand you correctly that the key provision of the Minsk Agreements that all these amendments, including constitutional amendments, should be coordinated with the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics, is being disregarded? Dmitry Kozak: Yes, at this point it is being disregarded. Certain schemes are invented, schemes, as I said, belonging to the realm of legal cretinism, like ""let us plant something in the Trilateral Contact Group; we don't talk to anyone, we don't hear Donbass; if Russia suggests something, we will see how to respond."" More likely than not, they will respond the way described by you and me. And later, the OSCE will allege that this has been coordinated within the black box known as the Trilateral Contact Group. This is a trumped-up procedure. Vladimir Putin: Ok. Then I have what I can call a final question for this part. Tell me and our colleagues your opinion as to whether or not the Kiev authorities will implement the Minsk Agreements? Dmitry Kozak: They will not – ever – if the developments follow their normal course. Let me reiterate: as is obvious, they do not want, either with Minsk, or without Minsk to bring Donbass back into Ukraine. Vladimir Putin: Ok. Dmitry Kozak: It is useful. Vladimir Putin: Thank you, all right. Dmitry Kozak: Mr President, now or later? I just wanted to answer the question about whether or not to annex Donbass; what we should do about this later and how to use it at talks with the West, because this is a very serious problem. Vladimir Putin: Let us now confine ourselves to your remarks… Dmitry Kozak: Ok. But later, I think, we will discuss it separately. Vladimir Putin: Mr Kozak, we will confine ourselves to your remarks on the negotiating process within the framework of the Minsk Agreements and to your assessment of prospects. We have understood that, in your opinion, there are no prospects for the development of the negotiating process within the framework of the Minsk Agreements. Thank you. (Addressing Alexander Bortnikov.) Now I would like to ask Director of the Federal Security Service, Mr Bortnikov, to report on the situation at the border, including with regard to border officers recording the number of people crossing our border, refugees, and on developments at the border. Director of the Federal Security Service Alexander Bortnikov: Mr President, We can see that the situation is deteriorating in the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics. We see that shelling is intensifying, threatening primarily the lives of civilians. Because of these circumstances, refugees have started moving towards the Russian border, and as of 9 am this morning, around 68,500 civilians had entered Russia from the DPR and LPR, according to statistics provided by the border service. First, we are maintaining direct contact with representatives of the government bodies in the regions that are dealing with refugees. Second, we can see that, as a result of intensified shelling by Ukrainian forces in the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics, there have been shells landing in the Russian Federation, first of all, in the Rostov Region. Given this circumstance, the Federal Security Service and the Russian Investigative Committee are carrying out the necessary operative investigative measures. Last night, two Ukrainian sabotage groups approached the border with Russia in the Lugansk region and Mariupol. As a result of the battle fought by our border troops, supported by the Defence Ministry, these two sabotage groups were destroyed. One military of the Ukrainian troops was captured. Further steps are being taken. Overall, the situation at the border on our side is stable. We are monitoring the border and providing military reinforcements, including to the Border Service. We are working together with law enforcement agencies and the Defence Ministry. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Mr Shoigu, I know that the Defence Ministry is monitoring the situation in the conflict zone. Please report. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu Shoigu SergeiDefence Minister : Mr President, colleagues, Reporting on latest developments, more than 107 shelling incidents were reported between February 19 and 20, including over 70 by heavy weapons, 122-mm weapons and mortar guns. Due to the activity of both the sabotage groups and artillery in Donetsk, the city has been left practically without water. Around 90 percent of the city has no water supply. As for Lugansk, two-thirds of the city has no gas. In fact, all people living at the contact line have been forced to evacuate. A small segment of the population that has to stay and work there, at continuous cycle facilities, has been affected, unfortunately. Literally today, a miner was killed at a bus stop by an artillery round. In the past 24 hours or overnight, to be more precise, more than 40 shelling incidents were reported across all areas, in total, in a single night. Based on our data and expert reports, we believe that the attacks are not random but targeting specific sites. It is fire for effect. They understand what they are hitting. Mr President, in this context, I would like to briefly report that as of today, a total of 59,300 troops are concentrated at the border with the Lugansk and Donetsk regions from the Ukrainian side. As a result of your negotiations and lengthy talks on security measures, troops and heavy arms (especially heavy arms) were supposed to be withdrawn from the contact line to shooting distance, in order to prevent fire from reaching populated areas. Today, we can see troops being concentrated and heavy weapons returning to their previous positions. What is the current situation? They have 59,300 troops, Tochka-U launchers, 345 tanks, 2,160 armoured vehicles, 820 artillery guns and mortar launchers, and 160 multiple-launch rocket systems, including Smerch. I cannot help but point out that these forces do not include those nationalist battalions that have been talked and written about so much and which, based on our completely objective data, are poorly controlled by the country's leadership and commanders on the ground. Naturally, they act as they see fit – hence the sabotage groups that break through in different locations and commit terrorist attacks such as blowing up vehicles, damaging power lines, substations, gas pipelines and more. Outside the context of the developments in the Lugansk and Donetsk regions, I would like to draw the Security Council members' attention to Mr Zelensky's statement in which he said that Ukraine wants to regain its status as a nuclear power. ""Power"" may not be the right word. A nuclear country. This is extremely dangerous for several reasons. First, over the long years when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, resources were created in Ukraine to build both nuclear weapons and launchers. By the way, since tactical and nuclear weapons are based in Germany, the same weapons could easily emerge in Ukraine as well – using existing launchers. I mentioned Tochka-U. Its launcher is easily compatible. They possess the equipment and technology and they have specialists who, in our estimation, have capabilities far greater than those of Iran and North Korea – the countries which are discussed at all levels in the context of agreements on their de-nuclearisation. Then, there are those nationalist battalions scattered all over Ukraine. I think it is no secret that they are to a great extent in control of the situation in specific locations, cities and regions of Ukraine. I am talking about extremely radical nationalist views, extremely radical calls concerning Donetsk, Lugansk, Crimea and, of course, our country. The overall situation is extremely tense. Since February 14, we have noted a more active phase and efforts to bring forces to the highest level of combat readiness. It means that considerable and more serious provocations are in the making or at least they are preparing to deal with the Donbass issue with the use of force. This has been indicated by changes in the deployment of heavy machinery and artillery guns, and changes in radio frequencies used for their communications. Then, of course, there is everything connected or connected in the first place with frontline activity – I am talking about shelling. It has been a long time since anything like this happened. We are very close to the 2014–2015 situation. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Colleagues, I think we are all aware of the status of the negotiating process on the Donbass settlement. It has been described in sufficient detail by the Federal Security Service Director and the Defence Minister. We need to give an answer to the question that was raised a long time ago and is included in the State Duma's appeal to the head of state. This question concerns recognising the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic. We see the threats and blackmail coming from our Western colleagues, and we understand where this step stems from, but we understand the situation at hand as well. Mr Medvedev. Deputy Chairman of the Security Council Dmitry Medvedev Medvedev DmitryDeputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation : Mr President, colleagues, The President and the speakers have just described the overall situation related to ensuring our country's security. I am referring to NATO and the United States' attempts to definitively redraw the map of the world in their favour, advance to our borders and practically put us in a hopeless situation. These are, in fact, the red lines the President spoke about at various forums and meetings. Speaking about the situation surrounding the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic, it is quite clear – at least, I think so, and our colleagues have just confirmed this in their remarks – essentially, Ukraine does not need these territories. In any case, they are a bargaining chip in the tug of war over the status of Ukraine. The residents of these territories have not received any support or assistance from the Ukrainian authorities for many years now. On the contrary, they are subjected to mass reprisals, such as shelling attacks, depriving them of basic amenities and violating basic human rights. Overall, based on the unfolding developments, we can conclude that the package of measures included in the Minsk Agreements will not get implemented. Moreover, for obvious reasons, even with pressure from foreign countries such as France and Germany, in all likelihood, the current Ukrainian regime, namely the incumbent President, does not need this implementation, since it will prevent him from being re-elected to the post of president, which is what he wants more than anything else in the world. So, he is not interested in complying with the existing agreements which you, Mr President, just mentioned, when both he and his National Security and Defence Council Secretary are openly saying that these are harmful agreements, and then keep pulling the wool over our Western colleagues' eyes during personal meetings or telephone conversations as they issue ritual statements about their willingness to implement these very Minsk agreements. We are facing a complex dilemma regarding the recognition of these two territories, which are ready to seek such recognition, and which have made the corresponding requests to us. Our parliament has adopted a resolution to that effect as well. I remember 2008 quite well, so I can speak based on some experience, since I had to make a difficult decision to recognise South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent subjects of international law, that is, to give them, at least from our point of view, international legal standing. We know what happened next. I am not going to talk about this now. There is a vast number of difficulties, and there are problems. All the while, it is quite clear that it made it possible, let us face it, to save the lives of hundreds of thousands of people who live within this territory, and, to a certain extent, it was a lesson for NATO and a number of European countries, a lesson that no one can do this to the Russian Federation. Today, the situation is much more complicated, but in some ways, maybe even simpler. I will explain. It is more complicated, because the scale of the potential conflict is incomparable to what we dealt with in 2008. This is absolutely so based on the analysis that has just been carried out by the Defence Minister. On the other hand, in some ways it is easier for us, because back then we did not know what the response would be. There were all kinds of conversations. I had conversations, and Mr Putin talked with President Bush as well. Now we know what will happen, we are aware of all the problems and difficulties, as well as the proposals concerning sanctions, which are being repeatedly, from all directions, so to say, broadcast to us. We understand that the pressure will be overwhelming, but we understand how to resist this pressure. In this sense, I think the bitter experience of the past 14 years was beneficial for us. This experience showed that it will be difficult for us. Here, I will give my personal assessment – ​​but after a while, with skilful management of the situation, and, I emphasise, I think we have learned how to do this under the leadership of the President – ​​the tension that is now vibrating around our country will subside one way or another. Not quickly, not all at once, but this is how human history works: sooner or later, they will get tired of this situation and will themselves ask us to resume discussions and talks on all issues of ensuring strategic security. Here, you know, it is like that line from the famous book by Bulgakov: never ask for anything, they will come to you themselves and offer everything. This is about how developments unfolded in 2008–2009. They came to us and suggested resuming relations across the board. Let us face it, Russia means a lot more than Ukraine for the international community and our friends in the United States and the European Union, and everyone understands this, including the Ukrainians. So, of course, we always need to avoid sensitive issues, but still, the rules of the genre are such that after a while, most likely, the situation associated with the recognition of the respective territories will start cooling down. We know this from previous experience. I would like to point out something that has not yet been discussed today. An elementary but also extremely important matter. About 800,000 citizens of the Russian Federation are currently residing within the borders of these two unrecognised entities. Mr President, I am not even talking about the Russian world, which we take care of, help and support in every possible way, but citizens of the Russian Federation. Citizens who live in another country. They are our people. I want to emphasise that they are not only people who speak Russian, they are citizens of our country. Everyone is aware that, for example, when US citizens run into any problem at all, when just one is abducted somewhere, the Americans conduct special operations. I think that we, as the Security Council members, cannot ignore this fact. So, I think that if the situation follows the path that I just laid out and there are no signs of improvement in sight, then the only way out of this situation in this case will be to recognise the legal standing of the respective territories, which is entirely within the purview of the President. Judging by the signs that we are now seeing, in all likelihood this situation will not improve. You said, Mr President, I think it is crucial for our society, the citizens of our country, to express the appropriate sentiment, since we all live in the same house, and all this is connected with major processes and the military component. But, as far as I know, the vast majority of citizens of our country would support such step. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Mr Medvedev, and I want to say this to all of you now: each of you knows that I did not discuss anything with anyone in advance. I want to emphasise this. I did not ask for your opinion in advance. What is happening now is happening, so to say, unrehearsed, because I wanted to know what your opinion is without any prior preparation. I believe this to be very important, and I would like the State Duma Speaker to express his opinion on this issue. Mr Volodin. State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin Volodin VyacheslavState Duma Speaker : Mr President, colleagues, The State Duma has taken a decision and, Mr President, we have appealed to you about it. This decision was not spontaneous, as it was thoroughly studied and weighed and we had several versions, however, the majority – 351 out of 450 Parliament members – voted in favour of sending the President a request to recognise the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic. The Parliament members who supported another version were of the same opinion but they proposed to first forward the draft resolution to the Foreign Ministry and other governmental bodies. We believed the situation in the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics was critical and our decision was primarily prompted by humanitarian considerations because people were dying and there was no end to it. Parliament members believe that Kiev has deliberately engaged in foot-dragging and sabotaging the Minsk Agreements. It is unacceptable. Of course, when taking this decision, we were cognisant of the fact that our citizens, our compatriots live there. One million two hundred thousand people have applied for Russian citizenship. About 800,000 people have been granted Russian citizenship but many more are still seeking to acquire it. So, our first priority is defending citizens of our country, our compatriots. We are also guided by the consideration that the situation has not changed in eight years. More than that – despite even the involvement of the representatives of other countries in the efforts to resolve this issue, Kiev has sabotaged all the obligations it assumed earlier. This is why, Mr President, we are asking you to consider the State Duma's appeal and recognise the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Ms Matviyenko. Speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matviyenko Matviyenko ValentinaChairwoman of the Council of Federation : Mr President, colleagues, For seven years now, a humanitarian catastrophe has been unfolding before our eyes in the centre of Europe. All these years we witnessed genocide, blockade, non-payment of pensions and benefits, and shelling. For seven years, Russia has consistently advocated at all levels for a political and diplomatic solution to the internal Ukrainian conflict, in fact, for putting an end to the civil war, at all platforms, including through parliaments. Nobody heard us. The alleged implementation of the Minsk Agreements was nothing but going through the motions. The endless meetings of the Contact Group were pointless and useless. And it became clear that the Kiev puppet regime not only did not want to but was unable to bring any solution to it. After all, look, at the snap of [President] Biden's finger, the prosecutor general was removed from office that same day. In the same way, if they wanted this conflict in Ukraine to end, all they had to do was direct the Kiev government accordingly, and it would have immediately sat down at the negotiating table and fulfilled the Minsk Agreements. Ukraine needs this conflict in order to somehow justify the worsening economic and social situation, as it attributes everything to an alleged war. The West needs this conflict as an anti-Russian project, where Ukraine is just a bargaining chip – it thinks not about its national interests, but rather about how to please its handlers. That is why the Minsk Agreements have not been implemented. Let us remember what the residents of Lugansk and Donetsk wanted. They were called separatists and terrorists. They said: give us economic autonomy, we are tired of feeding Kiev, and give us the right to speak our native Russian. The usual demands, the usual European values ​​that everyone is talking about at length. Instead, there were two attempts at an armed seizure of the territory with a large number of fatalities and an organised humanitarian disaster. Where is the OSCE? Where are the guarantors who signed the agreement prior to the coup? The heads of Germany, France and Russia got together and adopted decisions. Not a single attempt was even made to act on them. The Steinmeier formula seemed to be a straightforward document laying out a sequence of actions. You see, for Ukraine it is just territory, whereas for Russia, for us, these people are citizens and human beings: Russians, Russian speakers, or Ukrainians, it doesn't matter. And the worst thing the West is doing is trying to pit the two Slavic fraternal nations against each other. The residents of Donetsk and Lugansk have become hostages to this anti-Russian project. How much longer can we try to talk sense into them? How much longer can we explain things? Ultimately, you have to come up with a decision. We had enough patience and enough arguments to have Ukraine comply with the Minsk Agreements and to follow a peaceful, diplomatic path. Clearly, this is not part of their plan. They do not want to do so and will not. We must call a spade a spade. The residents of Lugansk and Donetsk rebelled against the bloody anti-state coup when the first draft law submitted to the Rada was the draft law abolishing the Russian language. Our partners are saying that, indeed, the Minsk Agreements must be complied with since they are an international document adopted by the UN. But instead of forcing Ukraine to do so, they are wagging their finger at us all the time and threatening us with sanctions, instead of forcing, so to speak, Ukraine to peace. Instead, they are conducting the military development of Ukraine and supplying all types of weapons there, including offensive weapons. Does it occur to them that nationalists, or Bandera followers, which is the right way to call them, might come to power there tomorrow and use these weapons? Will that add stability to Europe? Is this the way to peaceful and stable development in Europe? It seems to me that this has already become simply a moral duty for us in Russia. You know, I just cannot watch these videos and I think the majority feels the same. Poor women, elders that are weeping and children who are sitting in basements and taking their classes, and the entire international community is looking at all this through a blindfold. It is impossible to talk about any European values after this. This is inhuman and immoral. I will say it again – it is impossible to tolerate this any longer. It is necessary to make a decision. If recognition of the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics would resolve this problem, and this is obvious, it means we must take this step. Threats of sanctions are, of course, painful and unpleasant but, look, we are called the aggressor and yet we have never announced sanctions against Ukraine. We, along with Belarus, continue supplying it with electricity and petrol that is used to fuel tanks bound for the border with the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics. We supply gas and many other things. Therefore, I believe it is time to make a decision without delay. Mr President, I would like to say just a few words, maybe I am too emotional and please excuse me but what harm has Russia inflicted on Ukraine in the 30 years of their separate existence as independent states? What harm has it caused? We supplied it with almost free gas. We did not interfere in its affairs unlike the United States that said it had spent US$5 billion on regime change. We kept out. The United States wanted Yushchenko to be elected illegitimately in the third round, and he was. We did not influence the elections and did not interfere in them – we wanted the Ukrainians to elect their president themselves. During all these 30 years, the illegal transfer of Crimea and Sevastopol to Ukraine was never on the agenda. Yes, we felt bad about this; it stung. We knew that over 200 years ago, Catherine the Great decreed that Crimea and Sevastopol can join the Russian Empire of their own free will. Remember that the Black Sea Navy has been based there for over 200 years, that is, for longer than some states have existed. Yet, we did not raise this issue even once. We were compelled to defend the people because the Banderite units were moving ahead. Even such acts of intimidation as the shooting of unarmed police on Maidan and the burning of people in Odessa would have paled. It is hard even to imagine what they could have done in Crimea and Sevastopol. This is why Russia supported the free choice of Crimea and Sevastopol. So, recognise this fact! We acted strictly in accordance with the UN Charter where the right of nations to self-determination overrides everything else. There is a ruling of the UN Court on Kosovo and the like. All these arguments are well known. Yes, they wanted to see a NATO flag in Sevastopol instead of the flag of the Russian Black Sea Fleet but we have no moral right to allow this. This is why this issue is closed altogether. This must be recognised. I believe it is time to make a decision. It is simply immoral to continue discussing it to death and dragging it out, while pretending that something is being done. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Mr Patrushev. Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev Patrushev NikolaiSecretary of the Russian Federation Security Council : Mr President, colleagues, The issue we are discussing today is extremely pressing but let me take a broader view of it. In its doctrinal documents, the United States calls Russia an enemy, just like China, and practically everywhere they are operating from this standpoint. I would also like to emphasise that we are saying we are holding talks with NATO, the OSCE, the European Union, and the leaders of European countries. Talks must be held, but talks must be held with the United States. Everyone else will do as the United States says, including NATO, the OSCE, the European Union, and so on. So, the United States should be the main negotiator that we engage with. Look, Mr Lavrov is saying they want to set up a meeting between President Biden and President Putin. They are not saying what they want to discuss. Just a meeting to be able to say that we maintain a dialogue and so on. We have no need for talks for their own sake. We need to achieve specific goals. They are hiding their specific goal, which is none other than the collapse of the Russian Federation. Our goal is to protect our country's territorial integrity and sovereignty. With regard to the conflict in Ukraine and related developments, everyone is aware and convinced this was not organised by the people of Ukraine. The people of Ukraine are against this. They are intimidated and forced to follow this path. It was manufactured by the United States, just like during the conflict with Georgia in 2008, when the decisions were made. So, the United States is the only country to talk with. With regard to the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic, the people have had enough, and continuing to torture them is not an option. The [State] Duma made an absolutely right move to adopt these decisions. I understand that we must support the decision that the Duma recommends that you, as President, adopt. I think that if we do this, we will protect the people who live there, and we should take care precisely of this, and give them the opportunity to work in peace. To reiterate, what is happening there is a local conflict orchestrated by the United States. Therefore, I motion that it would be advisable to accept the proposal of the American side, President Biden's proposal to have talks during which it would be possible to say that ""you did everything you could to harm the people of the Lugansk People's Republic and the Donetsk People's Republic, and we must support them. If you can stop this bloodbath soon – say, two or three days – we will maintain a dialogue with you. Then, let the people make progress, and let them agree and implement not the ""road map"" of the Minsk Agreements, but a plan so that there is a tight deadline for each item."" But I am convinced that the answer you receive will be negative, they will not agree with you. So, recognition is the only option. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Mr Mishustin. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin Mishustin MikhailPrime Minister of the Russian Federation : Mr President, Security Council members, We have been preparing for months for a potential response to the recognition of the DPR and the LPR. I am primarily referring to import substitution and an analysis of all risks that we may face if we adopt these decisions. We have thoroughly reviewed these risks and we understand the issues linked with restrictions on the import of high technology and many other problems. We have also established relevant groups in our ministries and departments under the guidance of the Finance Ministry. They will decide how we should respond if we make these decisions, and what decisions should be made jointly, in particular, with the Central Bank. It is clear to us that, as the situation will continue to deteriorate (as you said today, Mr President) Russia cannot afford to lose pace. Today we must exacerbate this situation and meet it head on, because this is the only way to catalyse import substitution and fulfil the national development goals you set before us. We support these efforts and will do all we can to ensure the economic development and wellbeing of our people. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: So, you support the appeal by the State Duma? Mikhail Mishustin: I have now heard what Mr Patrushev had to say. I think it is necessary to get our position across, to catalyse it, if you will, and if there is no progress, to recognise the LPR and the DPR. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Mr Naryshkin. Director of the Foreign Intelligence Service Sergei Naryshkin Naryshkin SergeiDirector of the Foreign Intelligence Service : Mr President, We have seen for a long time, and I periodically inform you about this, that the current leaders of Ukraine are not going to honour the Minsk agreements. The President of Ukraine says in his circle that he can say anything he wants about the Minsk agreements for the record. He can say he adheres to the Minsk agreements whereas in reality he is not going to fulfil them. The same is typical of his conversations with Western leaders. If there is no press around, he says bluntly that ""we simply cannot abide by the Minsk agreements."" Power is more precious to the current Ukrainian authorities than peace, the restoration of peace and the end of this conflict between the Kiev regime and Donbass. With regard to the developments in Ukraine, I can say that this notorious thesis about the Russian leadership's plans to ""invade"" Ukraine was born within the walls of the US State Department and has been whipped up to such proportions that it is already reminiscent of war propaganda. This was done in order to try to provoke the Kiev regime into another attempt to resolve the problem of Donbass by military means. Of course, we simply have no right to let this happen. As mentioned earlier, there are about four million people who live there and who want to speak Russian and to think in Russian; they want to celebrate their history and the heroes who defended this land for many, many years. Thinking back to what Russia did seven or eight years ago, when it simply responded to the desire of the people of Crimea and Sevastopol to live as part of Russia – and this decisive opinion was expressed by the residents of Crimea and Sevastopol during the most democratic procedure, which is the nationwide referendum – I believe that in the current situation we are simply obligated to act in this way. I would agree with Mr Patrushev's proposal that our, so to speak, Western partners can be given a last chance in order for them to force Kiev to make peace and comply with the Minsk Agreements as soon as possible. Otherwise, we must take the decision that is being discussed today. Vladimir Putin: What does ""otherwise"" mean? Do you propose starting a negotiating process or recognising the sovereignty of the republics? Speak plainly. Sergei Naryshkin: I will support the proposal to recognise… Vladimir Putin: Will support or support? Speak plainly, Mr Naryshkin. Sergei Naryshkin: I support the proposal… Vladimir Putin: Just say yes or no. Sergei Naryshkin: That is what I am saying: I support the proposal to have the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics become part of the Russian Federation. Vladimir Putin: We are not talking about this, we are not discussing this. We are talking about recognising their independence or not. Sergei Naryshkin: Yes. I support the proposal to recognise their independence. Vladimir Putin: Good. Please take your seat. Thank you. Mr Kolokoltsev. Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev Kolokoltsev VladimirInterior Minister : Mr President, colleagues, Looking back in history, one can always find analogies to certain processes that we are currently observing. The point of view of the current and former Kiev authorities is that they were forced to sign the Minsk agreements in a difficult situation back then, because they were driven into a corner, and that the Minsk agreements are akin to an act of capitulation. Well, then, ""colleagues,"" let us draw a historical parallel and remember May 1945. Supposedly, Germany signed the Act of Surrender and failed to comply with it for seven years citing a variety of circumstances such as getting into pockets in the streets of Berlin and the like. This is an analogy. So, what can we talk about today when our foreign partners invite us to play a fair game at the negotiating table? We can play a fair game only when we have honest and trustworthy partners at the table. However, when you have partners with marked cards who are trying their best to justify official Kiev's hypocritical and deceitful position, what is there to discuss then? Who is inviting us to start this dialogue? We are encouraged to do so by our foreign partners who, having presented a vial with white powder, proceeded to bomb Iraq, change the legitimate government, and drown the people in blood. Having done that, they are inviting us to a dialogue. There is no doubt that these republics and their legal standing must be recognised. But I have an amendment to make. They should be recognised within the administrative boundaries which these republics and the peoples of these republics had prior to their occupation by the armed forces of Ukraine, namely, from Mariupol to those historical borders. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much. Regarding the negotiating process, Mr Kozak reported it is at a dead end. We have been negotiating for eight years now. This is what we are talking about. All plenipotentiary envoys are present here. I would like to ask one of you, say, Mr Shchegolev, to speak out. Of course, I expect you to express your own position, but we will assume that our other colleagues adhere to approximately the same viewpoint. Should any envoy feel the need to add something and express their point of view, they are welcome to do so. Please, go ahead. Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoy to the Central Federal District Igor Shchegolev Shchegolev IgorPresidential Plenipotentiary Envoy to the Central Federal District : Mr President, members of the Security Council, We all remember 2014 and the pain our people felt with regard to ongoing developments in Crimea and what began to unfold in Donbass and Lugansk. We remember the public demanding the recognition of these two republics back then. We are aware of the courage and patience the political leadership of the country needed in order to give the new Ukrainian authorities a chance to use their own resources to heal this wound on the body of Ukraine and its people, who are, in fact, one people with us. Over this period, the second President is nearing the end of his first term in office, and the first President has already been charged with high treason for signing the Minsk agreements. We hear the Ukrainian Nazis describe what will happen to the people of these republics after the Ukrainian government returns there. They directly threaten to destroy them and subject them to vetting and physical execution. Today, a force is concentrated on the borders of Ukraine, which is comparable in its offensive firepower to the Guderian-led grouping, which went from Bryansk to Donbass in August 1941. At the same time, Russia is accused of being overly aggressive, perhaps because it is too aggressive in protecting the lives of our brothers. I believe we should recognise Lugansk and Donbass. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. I would like to ask all those present here today, are there any other points of view or special opinions on this matter? None? I know the position of the Foreign Ministry, the Defence Ministry, and the Federal Security Service. Nevertheless, I would like to hear what you have to say. Mr Lavrov, you have the floor. Sergey Lavrov: Mr President, we have already heard all the arguments in favour of this decision. Wherever you look, it is the West that is doing all this, and the Ukrainian leadership takes pleasure in carrying it all out despite all the agreements and all the precedents in settling internal conflicts. The conflict in eastern Ukraine is the only conflict where one side is refusing to talk to the other, and the West fully supports this. Take Cyprus, the ""turkish republic of northern Cyprus."" The negotiating process there is in progress, with the UN playing a mediating role. Take Mali, where the French are now facing some challenges. The government is talking to the rebels there. The same applies to Ethiopia. The European Union oversees dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina. Everyone is seeking to assist these processes. There is this aspect here expressed in the term ""genocide,"" which you, Mr President, have mentioned during your press conference with Olaf Scholz. The history of the creation of Kosovo, an all but independent entity established without any referendum, is about genocide. The fact that they are now trying to prop up an overtly neo-Nazi, Banderite regime in Kiev is also a manifestation of genocide. In both cases, this is an attack against Slavs, against Orthodox Christians, and in Ukraine's case, against everything Russian. This runs counter to the Ukrainian constitution, as we all know very well. However, this has not prevented the Kiev regime from adopting one law after another to enforce ever tighter requirements for banning the Russian language not only in schools and universities, but in everyday life. I do hope that in this way, we will send a strong signal to the Russian world. For eight years now, we could not stay indifferent to the humiliating treatment our compatriots, our citizens have been facing. For this reason, I do not see any other alternative. As for the proposals to give the West two or three days more to come to its senses, this is a matter of opinion, but there is no doubt that the West will not change its position. Everyone understands this. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Mr Shoigu. Sergei Shoigu: Mr President, It is 2022, eight years since people, young and old, started learning how to live in basements. Not a single one of these clauses has been implemented during this period. Only one was implemented, when the forces were disengaged and the Ukrainian units were withdrawn. But the Ukrainians did this in the hope that one day they would be strong again and solve the problem by force. The way the picture develops, or the next page in this book is massive weapons deliveries to Ukraine. These deliveries are continuing with obscure aims and obscure motives. As it is, they have enough weapons for a lot of conflicts, large and small, which they stage with enviable persistence in the Lugansk and Donetsk republics. But every day, four, five, and even occasionally eight flights arrived with weapons, modern weapons. And when they say that these are for defence, I can hardly imagine that Javelins are defensive weapons. In the meantime, there are more Javelins there than in some NATO countries. This is evidence that no one is going to comply with the Minsk accords and that everyone is getting ready to solve the problem by force. The situation being what it is, I think they have left us with no other choice. Therefore, I say expressly ""yes"": yes, we should recognise them. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Alexander Bortnikov: Mr President, the Lugansk People's Republic and the Donetsk People's Republic, the people in these republics have for several years looked to the Russian Federation and asked it to protect them in the hope of living, working and bringing up children, in the hope of living in peace. I am absolutely certain that we should help them to implement their right and defend them. I am confident that a decision to recognise these republics will facilitate this. We will help realise this hope, definitely. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Mr Zolotov. Director of the Federal Service of the National Guard Troops of the Russian Federation and Commander-in-Chief of the National Guard Troops of the Russian Federation Viktor Zolotov Zolotov ViktorDirector of the Federal Service of National Guard Troops and Commander of the National Guard Troops : Mr President, colleagues, the German Chancellor has said that talk about genocide in Donbass is laughable. You know, I would like to hear what he would say if German citizens were living in that territory and if they were subjected to artillery fire every day. What would he say and would he chuckle about this? Mr Macron said (you have just spoken with him and told us what he said) that the Ukrainian authorities were ready to implement the Minsk accords. Our colleagues are absolutely right in saying that this is not the case. Moreover, Zelensky states that they are ready to create nuclear arsenals. So, what will we come to? At the same time, we do not border on Ukraine, we have no border with Ukraine. This is the Americans' border, because they are the masters in that country, while the Ukrainians are their vassals. And the fact that they are rushing weapons to Ukraine and are trying to create nuclear arsenals will backfire on us in the future. Recognising these republics is certainly a must. I would like to say that we should go ever further to defend our country. That is all I have to say. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Fine. Thank you. Colleagues, I have heard your opinions. The decision will be made later today. I would like to thank you for this meeting, for this conference."

You know that less than a month ago I had a meeting with our Olympic team before its departure for the Winter Games in Beijing. The games ended yesterday, and we have begun the countdown to the next landmark sports festival, the Paralympic Winter Games. It is a unique event in terms of its inspiring power and the positive emotions stirred in us by our Paralympic athletes. Every time we see you perform and listen to your success stories, we admire the strong will and the grit it takes not just to overcome your health problems but also to gain a new foothold and a new meaning in life through high performance sports. Therefore, first of all, I would like to thank you and your teammates for making this choice, for your commitment to sport and for your fortitude, resolve and ability to hold up well, which gives confidence and hope to millions of people, making it possible to expand the boundaries of what is possible. Also, I would like to congratulate you on being chosen for the Russian Paralympic team. Representing one's country at these competitions is a pinnacle and a coveted dream for any athlete. You have conquered this pinnacle, and there is only one last leap to the potential triumph, the Paralympic medal podium. It is the focal point of years of hard work to gain experience and mastery, of your sporting career. The Beijing Paralympic Games are not the first Paralympics for some members of our team, and your resolve to press ahead despite your past achievements, to keep training and to scale new heights commands our deep respect. This ongoing quest for excellence is one of the main traits of Paralympic athletes. You have a deep understanding of the great value of humanism, human dignity and equal opportunities. It is not surprising that the Paralympic Games are noted for a special, exceptionally kind atmosphere. It is created by your warm hearts, mutual support, sincerity and openness. The Paralympic lesson of empathy, equality and fairness is important today more than ever. The world urgently needs the powerful uniting force of sport, the noble principles of competition, your positive energy and proactiveness that transform society and teach moral maturity to people, especially young people. I am certain that the upcoming games will contribute to strengthening friendship and mutual understanding, and Paralympians, with their strong spirit, will not only impress their fans with spectacular performances and setting new records but will also help them to realise what is really important and significant in life. Dear friends, I know that you are still at training facilities, preparing to step out into the arenas and onto the tracks of Beijing. Your mentors, coaches, medical professionals and other staff are constantly working hard next to you. I would like to address them and express gratitude for their tireless efforts to take care of our remarkable talented athletes, for their top professionalism and sincere love for their jobs and their charges. The success of these athletes in competitions and the fact that they have been selected for the national team is, to a large extent, your achievement. I am glad to have this opportunity to wish a happy birthday to one of your colleagues, Alexander Larionov, the coach of the Russian national sledge hockey team, who is participating in this videoconference today. Also with us is Presidential Aide Igor Levitin, who is also celebrating his birthday today, his 70th. Mr Larionov and Mr Levitin, please accept our sincere greetings. We wish you success and new achievements. And, of course, good health, which is particularly important these days. Dear friends, we support each and every one of you. Therefore, I would like to ask all Paralympians to strictly comply with all the medical rules established by the Paralympic Games' Organising Committee and our experts due to the pandemic. The Government, the Federal Medical-Biological Agency and the Russian Paralympic Committee must do their best to provide the right conditions. I am confident that you are ready for this competition. Russian athletes have always been among the leaders of Paralympic sports. But we know very well that in sport, it is important to be mindful of the competition. Our competitors are strong and their journey to these Paralympic Games has been equally challenging. They have overcome themselves and external circumstances. They have been training just as strenuously and tirelessly. Therefore, they will be fighting tooth and nail to earn the title of the best of the best. I believe that you are ready to meet any challenge with honesty and grace, and win, showing your strong will and your best abilities. You should know that here in Russia, everybody loves you. We are very proud of you and will be cheering you on. I wish you great success and brilliant performances at the XIII Paralympic Games in Beijing. <…>"

Serious concerns were expressed due to the quickly deteriorating situation along the contact line in Donbass. The President of Russia noted that provocations from Ukrainian militants were the reason for the escalation. Attention was drawn to the modern weapons and ammunition being sent to Ukraine by NATO member countries, which is encouraging Kiev to pursue a military solution to the Donbass problem. As a result, civilians in the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics are suffering and being forced to leave for Russia to save themselves from intensifying attacks. It was emphasised once again that Kiev is only imitating a negotiating process and continuous to refuse to implement the Minsk agreements, as well as the agreements reached as part of the Normandy format. Considering the current state of affairs, the two presidents found it expedient to step up the search for a diplomatic solution between the foreign ministers and political advisors to the leaders of the Normandy format countries. These meetings are to help restore the ceasefire and ensure progress in settling the conflict around Donbass. Considering the above factors, Vladimir Putin once again emphasised the need for the US and NATO to take Russia's demands to ensure its security guarantees as seriously as possible and to respond specifically and to the point. The two leaders agreed to maintain contact at various levels."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67809,News conference following Russian-Belarusian talks,2022-02-18T17:00:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin and President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko held a joint news conference following Russian-Belarusian talks.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to the President of the Republic of Belarus for accepting my invitation and coming to Moscow today. We understand that the President has a very busy schedule right now, in connection with the necessary preparations for an important domestic event: the upcoming nationwide referendum of the new version of the Belarusian Constitution on February 27. Of course, we wish our Belarusian friends success in holding it. Let me note that our talks today were held in a constructive, business-like and friendly atmosphere, like we have had for many, many years. As both sides have stressed many times, Russia and Belarus are good neighbours, close allies and strategic partners. We are deeply connected by a common history, moral values and family ties. Diverse bilateral cooperation is always built on the principles of mutual respect, support and consideration of each other's interests. Of course, we have always paid and will pay special attention to the expansion of trade and economic ties. Despite the coronavirus-related difficulties, trade is growing: it increased by more than a third in 2021, or 34.4 percent, and amounted to a significant amount of US$38.5 billion. Almost half of all products manufactured in Belarus are exported to Russia, and Russia is a leading investor in the real sector of the Belarusian economy. Russian investment accounts for about 30 percent of total foreign investment in Belarus. And we will certainly try to create even more comfortable conditions for the business communities of the two countries and encourage entrepreneurial initiatives. Of course, matters related to building the Union State and promoting integration within it were among the central topics in our talks with the President of Belarus. We carefully studied the progress of implementing the strategic decisions approved at the November 4, 2021, meeting of the Union State Supreme State Council. We also discussed efforts to implement the 28 sectoral programmes of the Union and in general the provisions of the Treaty Establishing the Union State. During the talks, we noted that the 28 programmes we are talking about build on our long-standing cooperation and integration efforts in the relevant fields. Both sides noted that relevant agencies of Russia and Belarus have been working together effectively on promoting integration across the board. The high-level group for coordinating our integration cooperation has been gathering momentum. It held a regular meeting in mid-December. Our respective governments have also maintained close contact. Let me remind you that our prime ministers held eight meetings last year. In fact, they remain in touch constantly, almost on a weekly basis, if necessary. Of course, Mr Lukashenko and I keep the implementation of integration-related process under our personal control. We can outline several areas where we have achieved tangible progress recently. In particular, in the transport and logistics sector there was a significant increase in transits of Belarusian exports in many categories across Russian territory to third countries. We will continue our consistent efforts to build a common freight and passenger market within the Union State. In the lending and financial sector, we have been cooperating to overcome and minimise the consequences of illegitimate sanctions imposed by some countries with a view to worsening the socioeconomic situation in our countries. In addition, we have been working on integrating our payment systems and creating a new payment framework, as well as harmonising tax, customs, and labour laws of the two countries, and unifying our markets in the gas, oil, petrochemical, and electric power sectors. I would like to note that our joint efforts to implement the economic agenda of the Union State are ultimately designed to ensure economic growth and to improve the living standards of our people. Our other major integration projects have the same goals. I am referring to the Eurasian Economic Union, in the framework of which we are creating a truly common Eurasian market for goods, services, capital and workforce. It is important that all EAEU member states feel the practical effects of these processes. During our talks today we had an in-depth discussion on strengthening the common defence space of Russia and Belarus. We have agreed to continue taking the necessary collective measures to ensure the security of our two states in light of the growing military activity of the NATO states on the external border of the Union State. In this context, we praised the Allied Resolve 2022 military exercises, the active phase of which will run until February 20 in Belarus. I would like to point out that these exercises are purely defensive and do not threaten anyone. As you know, the defence ministries of our two states in due time announced the essence and goals of these planned– I would like to emphasise this– planned manoeuvres. As the President of Belarus, who attended them, said today, many foreign representatives and military attachés are attending the exercises and can see the whole thing with their own eyes. Responding to a request from President Lukashenko, I talked about my recent meetings with foreign leaders on the provision by the US and NATO of long-term and legally binding security guarantees for Russia. We believe it is both logical and understandable that this issue also concerns our Belarussian allies. We discussed the situation with Russia's requests for the West, the most important of which concern NATO's non-expansion, the non-deployment of strike weapons systems in close proximity to the Russian border, and the return of the bloc's military potential and infrastructure in Europe to the state of 1997 when the Russia-NATO Founding Act was signed. As I said earlier, unfortunately, the United States and other members of the alliance do not appear ready to sincerely consider these three pivotal elements of our initiative. At the same time, they have advanced a number of ideas of their own concerning European security, specifically, intermediate-range and shorter-range missiles, and military transparency, which Russia is open to discussing. We are ready to continue the negotiation track provided that all items are considered in their entirety, in conjunction with Russia's main proposals, which are an unconditional priority for us. President Lukashenko and I touched on the intra-Ukrainian conflict as well. The settlement process remains stalled; despite all our efforts, neither the contacts at the level of advisers to the leaders of the Normandy Format countries nor the consultations with our partners are helping. Kiev is not complying with the Minsk Agreements and, in particular, is strongly opposed to a direct dialogue with Donetsk and Lugansk. Kiev is essentially sabotaging the agreements on amending the Constitution, on the special status of Donbass, on local elections and on amnesty– on all the key items in the Minsk Agreements. Besides, basically, human rights are massively and systematically violated in Ukraine, and discrimination against the Russian-speaking population is being fixed at the legislative level. The President of Belarus and I agreed that the Minsk Agreements are the key to restoring civil peace in Ukraine and relieving tension around that country. All Kiev needs to do is sit down at the negotiating table with representatives of Donbass and agree on political, military, economic and humanitarian measures to end the conflict. The sooner this happens, the better. Unfortunately, right now, we are witnessing the opposite– the situation in Donbass is worsening. In conclusion, I would like to express my gratitude to Mr Lukashenko for our productive cooperation. I am confident that today's talks will serve to further strengthen the entire scope of allied relations between Russia and Belarus. Tomorrow, as we agreed, we will take part in several regular events related to our joint military activities. Go ahead please, Mr President. President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko: Friends, Our meeting with President Putin is taking place against the backdrop of an unprecedented escalation of military-political tensions in the world, as the President just said. Considering the urgency of the situation, the President and I have devoted much attention today to this issue and discussed potential joint actions as a response to the aggressive behaviour of our Western partners. I would like to emphasise once again: nobody wants a war, or even an aggravation of the situation or any conflict. We, Russians and Belarusians, do not need this. As people well versed in this issue, you probably understand that this no longer depends even on our neighbours, including Ukraine. You also see clearly who the escalation of tensions near our borders depends on. For the first time in decades, we have found ourselves on the threshold of a conflict that could, unfortunately, pull much of the entire continent into a maelstrom. We are seeing the irresponsibility and, excuse me for being blunt, stupidity of some Western politicians at its best. There is no logic or reasonable explanation for the conduct of the leaders of neighbouring countries, their truly morbid desire to walk the edge. The President of Russia has very mildly described the aggravation of the situation in Donbass. Unfortunately, it is true. People there are ready to flee the area and are probably already fleeing, as we know. This is not normal. I have the impression that some politicians who hold high and responsible positions in the so-called free world are simply pathologically dangerous to both their associates and, most importantly, to their own people. As you heard, Union Resolve 2022, Belarusian-Russian joint military exercises, will end in a few days. Tomorrow, Mr Putin and I will hold joint events in the Russian Federation, about which the media will be informed. As for the 2022 exercises that are nearing completion, I explained the basic point of this. The President just talked about it: given the growing military threat on our borders and the pumping of Ukraine with weapons, Belarus and Russia are compelled to look for adequate means of repelling a potential attack on their borders, including on our borders, the southern borders for Belarus. There is nothing surprising about this, we are looking at these borders in the south of Belarus– they are almost 1,500 km long. We are concentrating on this to defend ourselves; we are looking for points where we should basically build our defences. Belarus and the Russian Federation have a common air defence system, a joint regional military force, that is, a joint army, joint training centres, and finally, there is the Military Doctrine of the Union State. We have never hidden these documents or these areas of activity from anyone, everyone knows this. This is why it was our joint situational decision to hold these exercises. We conduct these exercises as transparently as possible in our own territory; we are not hiding anything from anyone; everything happens in full view of an entire army of attachés and the press. In talking about foreign policy we have not forgotten the Union State integration process. Four and a half months have passed since the Declaration of the Union State Supreme State Council was signed. It approved the main directions for the implementation of the provisions of the Treaty Establishing the Union State for 2021–2023 as well as the 28 Union State programmes. These programmes are about 30 percent complete. A lot has been said about what has been done under these programmes and how, as Mr President said just now. In particular, we are focusing on the following areas: taxation, customs cooperation, and establishing a common gas market. By the way, those who have moved the war of sanctions to the front lines will suffer equally, if not much more. This is a subject that President Putin and I have paid special attention to because this banditry and attempt to impose an economic war on us– it has already broken out– has cost us a lot. Of course, we have already learned how to counter the sanctions; as we have said, we have become stronger, as our bilateral trade shows. Nevertheless, we still have to focus a lot on countering the pressures of the sanctions. We have discussed this in detail. I am grateful to the President of Russia– to you, Mr Putin– for the instructions you have just passed to the Russian leadership in my presence, without hiding anything. I would like to thank you for this. It is clear that we, Russians and Belarusians, will survive this hybrid war. We can see how our cooperation has improved in industry; there are dozens of new goods in the structure of our trade; and foreign trade is diversifying. The world is big: you can't lock all the gates and you can't block all transport routes. Another part of our talks was devoted to the economy. It is gratifying that we did so well last year. Despite the pandemic and various virus strains, we increased our trade to almost 40 billion. And this is something to be taken into account, and then exports and imports between people– there are no borders between Belarus and Russia– this is billions of dollars too. It is important that both the Belarusian and Russian economies grew throughout the year in terms of gross domestic product, industrial production, and in many other areas of the real sector of the economy. Of course, we talked more about problem areas not about our successes. There are fewer of them, but they still exist. We discussed measures to support the economy, strengthen financial stability, increase business activity, and develop cooperation. Naturally, I informed the President of Russia of how Belarus is preparing for the most important political event– the constitutional referendum. We will hold it with dignity, in the interests of the Belarusian people, and this will in no way contradict our relations with brotherly Russia. The West is actively trying if not to destabilise then to at least aggravate the situation in the country with the help of our defectors. However, they have no illusions that the events of August 2020 will be repeated. This is important because it strengthens our confidence that together we will be able to overcome the most difficult situations, confront any challenge or threat and build a common future. And no one should expect us to back down from any difficulty, challenge or problem. Let me repeat what I just said: we do not want war, but if someone refuses to be still, our response will be asymmetric. Anyone in the world can understand this. And in this situation, in protecting the security of our peoples in our states, we will act appropriately. The President of Russia noted, and I absolutely agree with him: they are trying to tear us apart, to separate us, not only Russia and Belarus, but all those states that are set on unity. This is the wrong approach: it will never work. Kazakhstan is evidence of this. We appreciate that. Thank you for your attention. Kommersant newspaper correspondent Andrei Kolesnikov: You recently said that if the West remains aggressive, you will be an eternal president. In this connection, how do you assess the Belarusian people's chances of losing you? I think they are increasingly more negligible. And a question for the President of Russia. Mr President, how did you""survive"" Russia's invasion of Ukraine the previous night? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Let me go first, if you do not mind. I just did not pay attention to it. There is a lot of fake news, and constantly reacting to it is not worth it. We are doing what we feel we need to do, and we will keep going this way. Of course, we are watching the developments in the world and around us; however, we have clear and understandable benchmarks corresponding to the national interests of the Russian people and the Russian state. Alexander Lukashenko: Mr Putin, we did not invade Ukraine, and the poor things are so upset, they are looking for a new pretext to push Ukraine into some sort of provocations. As to my, pardon me, tenure in office, we will just discuss it with the elder brother and make a decision. Why are you worrying? Everything will be all right. As to your words(you said it right, I am even surprised that these words come from Kommersant) that those people's chances of breaking Belarusians' forces are negligible as you said. It cannot be said any better. And they will get more negligible further, they will not make it. And it has nothing to do with the Belarusian people, that we are allegedly a dictatorship and bend, pressure and persecute. It is fiction. Nobody pressures or persecutes anyone– we are just appropriately responding to those who push, used to push, towards a coup d'état in Belarus. That is the agenda as it is. They wanted to repeat exactly what they did in Ukraine; they failed and will fail again. I had a reason to mention Kazakhstan, it included. Alyona Syrova: STV Channel. Mr Lukashenko, Mr Putin, my question is addressed to both of you. You mentioned in your speeches the sanction war waged against us and against you. We see the pressure being systematically ramped up. The latest is the closure of potassium fertiliser transit. Russia is being threatened with preventive sanctions never seen before. And here is the question in this regard. Mr Lukashenko, you said a number of decisions and orders have been made right now, during the talks. How do you see possible anti-sanction counteractions? We often say that the power is in cooperation in the context of integration, so in the context of countering the sanctions, where is cooperation and who can help us here? Vladimir Putin: We must help ourselves in this respect, and this is the goal of our current meeting. We primarily focused, as Mr Lukashenko has already said, on economic issues, on issues of economic cooperation. The President of Belarus was very eloquent. He said the world is big, and one cannot put a lock on everything. This is exactly what it is in reality, and I join this assessment. We talked about the entire range of problems, including the one you mentioned. I will not go into detail now, but there is always a solution. As for what direction we should move in overall– I have already talked about this and would like to emphasise it again. First, this sanctions pressure is absolutely illegitimate. This is a gross violation of international law. Those who talk about this law care about it only when they stand to benefit. When there is nothing to gain, they conveniently forget all norms of international public law. We understand this perfectly well. Unfortunately, we have lived in this paradigm for many, many years because the powers that be believe they run the show and always interpret everything in their own favour, ignoring the interests of others. The only way out is to grow stronger from within, primarily in the economy. You are talking about sanctions. They will be imposed in any event. Whether there is some excuse today, for instance, linked with the events in Ukraine, or there is no excuse– one will be found because the goal is different. The goal is to impede the development, in this case, of Russia and Belarus. Those who pursue this objective will always come up with an excuse to introduce various restrictions. I will repeat that these restrictions are illegitimate. They amount to unfair competition. In fact, this is the whole point. In the past eight years, Russia has done much in this area, and this is called import substitution. We have not done everything we planned, but we have accomplished more than 90 percent of the tasks we set for ourselves. We still have to do more, and this is called enhancing economic sovereignty. Many countries of the world, even US allies, are facing today's restrictions. But they simply shut their mouth and bear it. As I said many, many years ago, nobody likes this. Nobody likes secondary sanctions or direct sanctions pressure. This boil will certainly burst eventually. It is important for us today to enhance our economic sovereignty and be more competent and up to date. We must give new impetuses to the modern areas of economic progress: digitalisation, artificial intelligence and genetics, to name a few. This is a complicated and big job– it is impossible to resolve this issue overnight, but we must move in this direction. The integration processes we are dealing with are aimed at precisely this goal– to become more competitive. Proceeding from this, we will be striving to improve the living standards of our people. I think this is all that may be said in the format of a news conference. Alexander Lukashenko: What was the general idea for our talks? In short, we mostly talked about economic issues, including pressure from the sanctions. The President just said what it was about: no matter what we do and no matter how hard we try to do anything– though we think, first, in terms of our interests and our people and so on– they will find a pretext for pushing this economic war further, regardless. These are not simply sanctions– rather, an economic war unleashed against our alliance– this is the gist of the matter. As for some details, the Russian President preferred to omit them– some particularly important issues were discussed in detail. For example, you raised the issue of potassium fertilisers: I am grateful to the President for his instructions, as I requested. We need a port. In violation of international agreements, we have been denied access to the ports we used to use. This is not the right approach: no country that has a coast has the right to cut access to the sea to a landlocked country. Take Russia, which has an outlet to the sea– it does not deny anyone access to the sea. Lithuania, Latvia and Ukraine have closed their routes to the sea[for us]. This is a violation. I just wanted to refresh your memory. The Russian President issued an instruction– I asked him about this– to let Russia help us, without foot-dragging and red tape, to build a port terminal for our use near St Petersburg and use it to tranship millions of tonnes of cargo; it is not a matter of funding– we have money to do this. He gave instructions in my presence to begin construction without delay. We will tranship millions of tonnes of cargo over 12 to 18 months– I do not know how long exactly; you can ask the ambassador who is sitting over there and who has been dealing with this issue. But if we withdraw from Ukraine and Lithuania– revenue from the transhipment of our cargo used to make up 30 percent of the latter's budget– we will never go back. We will hold out. It was the right thing to say that no matter what the situation is like, sanctions also mean new opportunities and, most importantly, the opportunity to engage in import substitution– we will make do. President Putin says that[Russia's import substitution objectives] have been 90 percent achieved, so cooperation between Belarus and Russia will take care of the remaining 10 percent. We will find a way out of this situation one way or another. Even when it comes to the most sensitive things for us, Belarusians and especially Russians, like the most cutting-edge and sophisticated technologies. We can produce anything. Which country was the first to release a vaccine when the pandemic started? It was Russia. Russia supplied the vaccine to Belarus and then we started producing it. The Russian President said:""You did well!"" We have already produced about 2.5 million doses in Belarus using Russian technology. We are also developing our own technology. Have we coped with this? We have. We will also cope with other issues. Thank you."

Following Russian-Belarusian talks, Vladimir Putin and President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko made statements for the press and answered journalists' questions. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, Let me warmheartedly welcome you to Moscow. You and I always stay in touch. It is the first time this year that we are meeting in person. We have a lot to discuss, to compare notes on several points. Of course, as this is our first meeting this year, I would like to note that last year was quite productive for us. First, we made significant progress in building the Union State: our colleagues worked closely on this and prepared 28 good programmes. In fact, development has been underway in many of these areas for a while. We have just updated these 28 programmes, which we planned to do before. We adopted the Migration Policy Concept and the Military Doctrine. Generally, a lot of work has been done. However, the actively developing economy is our main cause for joy. I have looked it up and we have quite a growth: over 30 percent, 35 or even over 38, and almost US$35 billion worth of trade. Of course, these are very good numbers that mean we have real feedback from what we are doing in the sphere of integration: this means jobs and people's standard of living and income levels. This is why I believe that we are acting and moving in the right direction. We will discuss all of this today. Thank you for accepting my invitation. And, of course, we will discuss the developments in the region and evaluate our military cooperation: right now, our military exercises are in the active phase. Tomorrow we will also take part in an important event in this complex of military cooperation. I am very glad to see you. Welcome. President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko: Thank you, Mr President. I am also glad to meet with you and to, at least just a bit, 'dilute' the western elite with our presence. Indeed, we have plenty to talk about. Our economic sector has been advancing. Despite the external factors – particularly, the externally-imposed inflation factors that we cannot avoid – I see that both in Russia and in Belarus we are making every effort possible in the current conditions to counteract inflation, and this is not easy. Indeed, both Russia and Belarus saw good economic growth last year. It is very important that now, at the beginning of this year, we should focus our efforts on countering any external economic pressure both against you and against us; the sanctions make the situation more difficult for us. This is why I would like to update you on this issue as well as on developments regarding our major companies and efforts that need to be made to retain growth – most importantly, to retain the momentum that we gained last year. Yet, as you have rightly mentioned, the economic development proves that their efforts will fail and they will not destroy us. I think we will agree on giving this growth an extra boost. Our military and political sphere has gained a leading position, as you said, due to actions by our western partners as we have to respond to them through our military exercises and diplomatic efforts. I think they are unlikely to succeed and they have already lost the first round; but I see that they are preparing for round two and making attempts to spread panic globally by saying we will invade Ukraine, surround and destroy it, and so on – although we have never had such plans, no matter how much we discuss these issues. But we will train our people to fight; we simply have to do this. Yesterday, I attended Russia-Belarus military exercises and saw Russian and Belarusian military units. There were many foreign journalists, and the event was very impressive. As you have mentioned, if everything goes as planned tomorrow, you and I will attend an interesting event. Vladimir Putin: We will not just attend it but take an active part in it. Alexander Lukashenko: Yes, we willtake part in these events.This is also our life, the life of our people – Belarusians and Russians. In a word, I am grateful to you for this opportunity to meet with you and discuss our relations one-on-one. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67797,Meeting on economic issues,2022-02-17T18:20:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow","The President held a meeting on economic issues, via videoconference.","Taking part in the meeting were Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov, First Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Sergei Kiriyenko, Deputy Prime Minister and Chief of the Government Executive Office Dmitry Grigorenko, Presidential Aide Maxim Oreshkin, Minister of Economic Development Maxim Reshetnikov, Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov and Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, good afternoon. We are starting a series of meetings to prepare this year's Address to the Federal Assembly. This is a large, complex and substantive job, which needs to take into account a number of important aspects. This is a team project of course, because although the President is the one who announces the decisions we have prepared, says what needs to be done and how to achieve our goals, it is our joint task. I suggest we begin by analysing the overall macroeconomic picture and consider an updated economic forecast for the next three years. We will discuss their impact on the implementation of current government projects and programmes, as well as on the launch of new initiatives. I must say that the Russian economy fared well last year amid the difficult global situation. According to the Ministry of Economic Development, the country's GDP grew by 4.6 percent, which means the national economy not just fully compensated for the 2020 decline, but exceeded the pre-crisis level. Unlike many other leading economies, Russia has normalised its budgetary policy. Last year, the federal budget ended with a surplus equal to 0.4 percent of GDP. As a reminder, a year earlier, we ran a 3.8 percent deficit. The country's non-oil and gas revenues amounted to 16.2 trillion rubles last year. Fourth quarter revenue exceeded the forecast the Government had enclosed with the federal budget law by more than 20 percent. This positive trend has continued into this year: in January, non-oil and gas revenues were 27 percent higher than a year earlier. Let me emphasise that with steady revenues, we will be able to address current problems and meet targets, as well as take new, additional measures to develop the economy and infrastructure, to strengthen the social sphere and support Russian families. At the same time, it is important that budget planning be systematic. We need to continue to apply the budget rule – I am making a point of saying this to emphasise – to ensure a balance of public finances and the stability of key macroeconomic indicators. I would like to specifically point out that inflation has recently become a serious challenge for most countries. In Russia, consumer prices accelerated by 8.7 percent year-on-year in January, which is noticeably above the target. However, the situation in the so-called developed market economies is not much better either. For comparison, in the United States, inflation reached 7.5 percent in January, much higher than market expectations, and in the eurozone, 5.1 percent from a year ago. This is a serious challenge for those countries. Nevertheless, we need to take effective measures to reduce inflation in our country. Both the Government and the Central Bank should certainly play a significant role here, with the latter maintaining a responsible approach to the implementation of its monetary policy. It is important to coordinate the efforts of the Central Bank and the Government and do so, of course, with due regard for the Central Bank's statutory authority and the effect this might have on business and investment activities; these joint efforts should further the objective of removing external and internal factors behind inflation. Rising prices primarily eat into people's income, having an adverse effect on families' well-being. Due to additional budget revenue, we have taken a decision to provide targeted support to the most vulnerable among us. We have made one-time payments to pensioners and families with schoolchildren and have additionally adjusted pensions, the minimum wage and the subsistence rate to account for inflation. We have adjusted maternal capital to reflect the real inflation rate. I would like to remind you that this year people's real disposable income is expected to increase by at least 2.5 percent. This is a benchmark set for the Government and this objective must be achieved without fail. In this connection I would like to note that rising incomes should be ensured not only by effective social support measures but primarily, of course, by economic growth, as you and I both know. This is a key condition for achieving objectives in the social sphere. It is important to assess the situation objectively. Clearly, last year's positive economic dynamics can largely be described as recovery and experts say that the potential for growth of this kind has been fully tapped. Under these new circumstances it is important to ensure sustainable long-term development to boost, so to speak, the potential growth rate of the Russian economy. The Government has been assigned this task and today we will talk about progress in accomplishing it. I would like to emphasise that we need to ensure broad-based development in all sectors of the economy and in each region of the country, which has to produce tangible results: improved well-being of the people and better quality of life all round, including the state of the urban environment, the environment in general, education and healthcare. In this context, I would also like to specially mention the objective of making quality healthcare services accessible everywhere in the country. We will soon discuss likely supplemental decisions on this and other matters at our next meetings. Now let us move on to our agenda. I would like to give the floor to Minister of Economic Development Maxim Reshetnikov. <…> Vladimir Putin: Let us sum things up and conclude our meeting today. As I have said, today we have our first meeting as part of drafting the Address to the Federal Assembly. What would I like to add to this? The Address to the Federal Assembly is not just a speech delivered by the head of state for the entire country, for the nation, promising some bonuses, additional benefits and solutions to social problems in the broader sense of the word. We will have to show the direction in which the country's development is headed, as well as its economy, and the basis for addressing the main task: improving the well-being of our citizens, which is the most important thing. In this context, I would like to elaborate on a few things. First, it is obvious that a certain amount of time has to pass between the decision to launch a project and its actual implementation, as Mr Mishustin just said, as well as his colleagues during our discussion today. Of course, timely decision-making is necessary, or we will not launch some projects at all or never see them completed. The example from the sphere of infrastructure was right and fair: it may take a year, or two, or five, seven, even ten, depending on the project. And we have some grand projects designed to take many years. We have to carry out the preparations in advance, of course, so that we will not find ourselves in a situation where funding is allocated on an emergency basis, which leads to the outcome mentioned by the Governor of the Central Bank. We saw a lot of examples at the end of last year, which Ms Nabiullina has mentioned. Let me repeat that we must avoid such situations. This brings me to my second point: precision and objectivity in forecasting the revenue portion of the federal budget is the ultimate priority. It is hard to disagree with the Ministry of Finance. I see that there are a lot of factors creating uncertainty and it is difficult to foresee everything. But still, it is necessary to take prompt and timely action to make certain necessary, correct, and justified adjustments. This is required to make informed, systemic decisions. I would like once again to use an example from last year, when just three months before its end, in September, the amount of oil and gas revenue was being projected. By the way, we can return the ball to the Ministry of Finance here. At the end of the year, actual receipts turned out to be significantly higher, by a full trillion rubles. Thirdly, it is important for us, of course, to maintain a conservative approach to state finances. What do I mean? We will continue to observe the budget rule which ensures the balanced growth of government spending. But let me repeat: of course, the budget rule must be followed systematically, based on objective estimates of expected revenue. Let me remind you here that last September we agreed that the practical implementation of the budget will correspond to the goals we set. This will make the situation more predictable for the Central Bank. Now regarding the proposal of the Economic Development Ministry for a new and better defined procedure for adding funds to the Government's Reserve Fund. I understand there is definitely a logic to introducing it; our colleagues have said as much. But let us agree with the Finance Ministry for the time being: we will not do this hastily right now – rather, we will see how it can work and, during our subsequent discussions, we will see if this move is justified and if this needs to be done at all, all the more so as the Finance Ministry believes that existing mechanisms suffice. Now regarding the evaluation of additional revenue. Some of our colleagues say that a trillion rubles can be allocated for this purpose – some quote a slightly higher figure, others a lower one. They say the budget will receive 1.4–1.5 trillion rubles in additional revenue, the Finance Ministry says it will be one trillion and, accordingly, is guided by this figure in calculating the amount that we will have to allocate in one way or another in order to meet our social obligations – growing social obligations due to changes in the economic situation in our country and around the world. These are questions that we, of course, have to consider before taking a final decision. I will repeat that this is our first effort. I know you have planned to continue this work in the Government. I ask you to coordinate your efforts and think through all potential risks and scenarios of how the situation may evolve. But, of course, I have to agree with what my colleagues said: in the social sphere, we always need to be thinking about solutions and moving towards resolving one of the most important issues, I mean, of course, fighting poverty. As for economic development in general, of course, attention needs to be given to infrastructure projects, which have always been important and are even more important in the current circumstances. Mr Mishustin is absolutely right about this and it is important to not miss the right moment for taking a decision. I would like to thank you. Even before our next meeting – it is scheduled for next week, if I am not mistaken – I will talk, in the regular course of work, with the Prime Minister in private, so to say, and with some of my colleagues from the Finance Ministry, the Ministry of Economic Development and the Central Bank. I would like to ask each of you, after the discussions you have and I will stay in touch with you in one way or another – to present your viewpoint to me as well before the next meeting. Thank you for the work done today. All the best to you."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67795,Expanded Interior Ministry Board meeting,2022-02-17T14:05:00Z,Moscow,The President took part in the annual expanded meeting of the Russian Interior Ministry Board.,"Participants in the meeting summarised the results of the work of internal affair authorities in 2021 and outlined priority areas of activity for 2022. Minister of the Interior Vladimir Kolokoltsev delivered the main report. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrades, Today, at the expanded meeting of the board you will analyse the ministry's work in the key areas and discuss short-term and long-term goals. I want to say right away that despite the complex situation due to the coronavirus pandemic – it has been a significant load on the ministry in general, and the minister has just reported that almost half of those who were going to attend today's meeting are sick – nevertheless, the entire system of the Ministry of the Interior has been functioning in a stable and reliable way. Thus, public order was maintained at a high level during elections to the State Duma and regional governments. The agency's employees did their job in a well-managed and competent way in the course of the national census, a large-scale project, as well as during major international events. I would like to note that last year, we saw a continued downward trend in serious and grave crimes, including those with the use of weapons. The crime rate in public places has also gone down and there are positive trends in a number of other important areas. I would like to thank the Interior Ministry staff for their diligent work, professionalism, commitment and courage. Colleagues, I will elaborate on the most important tasks you will have to address this year and in the longer term. Of course, an active crackdown on crime is our top priority. Let me remind you that last year the Federal Law On Police was amended to expand the authority of police officers, including the right to immediately inspect residential premises and vehicles upon receiving reports of incidents. We need to use these opportunities effectively to quickly solve crimes without delay, while – I want to emphasise this – guaranteeing the rights and freedoms of citizens. You know that human rights organisations have always paid attention to these amendments. We have agreed with the proposal of the Minister and with your proposals on the fact that work in hot pursuit is very important to solve crimes and for the effective operation of the law enforcement system in general. However, the fears of human rights activists have certain grounds. I am asking you to keep this in mind, and ensure and guarantee the rights and freedoms of citizens. Generally, I would like to once again note the task to radically improve the crime detection rate. According to last year's results, there has not been any significant progress here so far. This means that we need consistent and more effective work on all types of crimes that pose a threat to our society. These threats include new challenges related to crime seeping into the sphere of information technologies and communications. The number of crimes in this sphere is growing annually. Domestic companies suffer damage from the actions of cybercriminals. And more of our people are facing a loss of funds and savings, with irreparable moral damage, which evokes a strong public response. Pensioners, large families and people with disabilities fall victim to criminals. Nothing is sacred to these people; their only goal is to steal money. I believe it is necessary to significantly improve the procedure for interaction between the Ministry of the Interior and financial organisations, telecommunications operators, and other structures in the digital space and in telecommunications. In general, more coordinated work of the law enforcement agencies, corresponding state bodies and regulators, as well as the expert community and businesses is required to strengthen cybersecurity. It is necessary to be proactive, including in updating the regulatory framework and strengthening the technical capabilities of the Ministry of the Interior, because cybertechnology is developing rapidly, new risks are emerging, and it is necessary to prevent them and not to let criminals feed off technological progress. In this context, our next big task is to efficiently prevent crime. Here we also have new opportunities. For example, the decision to grant the police the right to issue an official warning to potential criminals and violators of the law has played a positive role. Last year, about 111,000 warnings were issued, which helped reduce the crime rate, including domestic crimes. We must continue to actively use this tool for prevention. Let me note that local police officers traditionally play a major role in crime detection and prevention. They work, as they say, on the ground, and know the problems of the area where they work and the people living there, which often helps not only to find a criminal promptly, but also to prevent the crime itself. Let me note that the 100th anniversary of the local police service is drawing nearer. I would like to call the attention of the Ministry's leadership to the need to hold anniversary events, but also to make additional decisions aimed at strengthening precincts and improving the work conditions and social protection of employees. I would like to elaborate on crime prevention among young people, among youth. Protecting the younger generation from crime is an essential task for the development of Russia and its future. Over the last few years, the number of crimes committed by youth has fallen, but this is by no means a reason for complacency. Armed attacks at educational institutions, cases of violence against children, their involvement in drug trafficking and extremist actions – all these incidents (and, unfortunately, they are not isolated) indicate that your work, including on prevention, should be more efficient. Here you should look for new, up-to-date approaches. You cannot follow the standard routine; you need to see the problems and difficulties of each young person. In this sense, I believe it is important to consolidate the efforts of all government bodies and all units of the prevention system to create a single state system for continuous social support for adolescents prone to delinquency. Furthermore, a serious signal that requires comprehensive analysis is the growth of crimes associated with extremism. In 2021, their number increased by more than a quarter. It is important for the relevant units of the Interior Ministry in cooperation with your colleagues from other law-enforcement bodies and special services to timely assess the risks of potential extremist manifestations and develop on this basis effective preventive measures. Special attention must be paid to efforts to neutralise attempts by extremists and all kinds of radicals to use the internet (we are all aware of this and keep talking about it) and other modern means of fanning ethnic, religious and social strife. I believe today the Interior Ministry system has all the powers it needs for this. In addition, it is necessary to more actively involve the media, civil society, youth associations and representatives of our traditional religions in preventing extremism. By public organisations, I mean the entire palette: youth and sports organisations, for one; we have many of these. We must simply look at what can be used and how in order to find an effective solution to this truly national goal. Successfully combatting extremism is directly related to resolving migration challenges. Naturally, we are happy to welcome all those who come to us to study, work and simply live, those who abide by Russian laws and respect our culture and traditions. Such foreigners, and primarily our compatriots, must have the opportunity to get all the necessary documents freely and without red tape. However, it is essential to take the toughest possible measures against illegal migration and the activities of the criminal groups that build their illicit business on it. As for any manifestations of extremism, violations of law and illegal work, this should serve as grounds for a rapid resolution on the deportation of such people from Russia and on banning them from entering in the future. It is essential not to let up for a moment in this environment. I would like you to consider these requirements in developing measures aimed at simplifying procedures for receiving citizenship, permanent or temporary residence and the right to work in Russia, and participation in the federal program for the voluntary relocation of compatriots, to which I will return, in conformity with all the requirements of Russian law. You know that quite recently, on February 10 of this year, an Interdepartmental Commission of the Security Council of Russia on improving state migration policy was established in this country. I expect its work to enhance national security in migration and to help regulate these processes so that they do not create risks and threats but serve the goals of our national socio-economic development. Colleagues, New serious requirements are being placed on traffic police units. It must be admitted that there is more order on the roads now, thanks to the adopted measures, including under the Road Safety project. I know that criticism of these divisions is traditional and eternal, but let us evaluate this work without bias; after all, there is more order, as the objective figures show. For example, 3.1 percent fewer road accidents happened in 2021. It is a small number, but still. Also, 5.8 percent fewer were killed, although still a lot of people are killed in these accidents, and 4.2 percent fewer people were injured, compared to the previous period. After all, these are real people with real lives, and their health and well-being matter. However, as I have said, many are still killed in road accidents, including many children, unfortunately. Mortality is high in accidents caused by drink drivers, as well as in collisions with pedestrians. It is important to continue working on improving what is considered acceptable behaviour on the road. I know that the Ministry of the Interior has great experience in cooperating with public and volunteer associations. You must further develop this partnership and make irresponsible and obnoxious behaviour on the road unacceptable in society. As before, more focus should go to removing criminal elements from the economy and combatting corruption. I would like to repeat once again: any inspections or actions by the Ministry of the Interior related to businesses must be justified; they must not create obstacles for businesses or harm companies that do business honestly, create jobs, and duly pay wages. I would like to ask you to make more active use of the new capabilities created by the law adopted last February in the fight against corruption. It makes it possible to expand the range of persons who can be held accountable for malfeasance, as you know. Your task is to prevent embezzlement of budget funds, as well as cases of criminal bankruptcies and illegal redistribution of or encroachment on property and assets. Finally, it is important to step up efforts to combat drug trafficking, including additional measures to promote cooperation between Ministry units and their colleagues from the Federal Security Service and the Federal Taxation Service, and to improve international antidrug cooperation, above all within BRICS, the CSTO, and the SCO. Comrades, The goal of the state is to ensure that people working in law enforcement can make a decent living. I know, of course, that there still are a lot of unresolved problems in this sphere, which the Minister and I discuss constantly. Nevertheless, significant funding is allocated to equip units with up-to-date vehicles and communications, as well as new weapons and special equipment. We will certainly increase social benefits for employees, including the indexation of salaries and pensions. I am confident that the employees of the Interior Ministry understand their colossal responsibility for our society and the entire country, and that they will, of course, do everything possible to perform these tasks at the highest level. Thank you for your attention. I wish you all the best in life and service. Thank you very much. <…> Vladimir Putin: Mr Kolokoltsev, colleagues, To wrap up for this part of your work, I would like to mention a few things that you are already well aware of. However, it will be useful to mention them again. The Interior Ministry system has always been considered, and indeed has always functioned, as the key link in this country's law enforcement network. The Interior Minister and I spoke in our opening remarks about the Ministry's areas of responsibility. They cover practically all aspects of society and the state. There is not a single area that can be said to lie outside the Ministry's responsibility. Naturally, people largely judge the state's performance on the quality of the Interior Ministry's work. You and I know all about this. But I would like to draw your attention to one aspect of this issue. It is perfectly clear and obvious. I would just like to ask you not to forget that people's lives depend on the quality of your work. This is the bottom line and must always be the focus. Thank you very much. I wish you all the best. I wish you success."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67790,Expanded meeting of Emergencies Ministry Board,2022-02-16T18:50:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow","Vladimir Putin took part in an expanded Board meeting of the Ministry of Civil Defence, Emergencies and Disaster Relief. The meeting took place via videoconference.","President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrades, good afternoon. We have always paid serious attention to the activities of the Ministry of Emergencies and will continue to do so. Today, at the annual expanded meeting of the Ministry Board, we will discuss your performance in 2021 and outline priority tasks for the future. Let me note that over the last three decades the Ministry has proven in practice that it is an essential and highly needed link in Russia's security system. It has become a flawless, mobile, and well-equipped organisation responsible for protecting our citizens in emergencies, as well as preventing and extinguishing fires and developing the civil defence system. Last year was difficult for the ministry. Floods in Siberia, in the Far East and in the south of Russia were an important test for rescue crews. They fought natural and man-made fires that threatened people and property. A major effort was carried out in response to the Listvyazhnaya Mine accident. This tragedy, which unfortunately killed several people– miners and rescuers– was the pain and misfortune of Kuzbass and the rest of Russia. And, of course, our people are grateful for the substantive aid you have provided in countering the coronavirus. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the ministry's experts have disinfected more than 40,000 social institutions and decontaminated over 46,000 transport infrastructure facilities, along with almost 12,000 kilometres of roads. You also fulfilled an important mission abroad during these difficult months. During the general lockdown when the borders were closed, Emergency Ministry planes helped evacuate Russians who were abroad on business trips or holidays. Over 1,400 tonnes of medical equipment and medicines, 120 tonnes of food and over 380,000 doses of Sputnik V and Sputnik Light vaccines were delivered to the countries that suffered most from the coronavirus. I would like to thank the managers, the military personnel, the employees and civilian specialists at the Emergencies Ministry for their dutiful work and their courage and selflessness in performing their duties, for their readiness to immediately help others, often at the risk of their own lives. Colleagues, To be clear, the demands on your work are always the toughest. Today, Emergencies Ministry forces and equipment, and your territorial units must respond more efficiently to all possible emergencies. To do so, operational, analytical and personnel capabilities must be built up and the ministry must be provided with the latest equipment. This must be done in a systemic and consistent way, in full conformity with existing plans. I will note that that last year a programme was approved for the first time to re-equip the Emergencies Ministry with modern types and models of firefighting and aviation equipment. This has been on the agenda for a long time. Significant funding amounting to almost 190 billion rubles is being allocated for the programme until 2030. It is especially important to upgrade firefighting and rescue units, to increase their mobility and readiness to immediately respond to natural and industrial threats. As such, I think it is necessary to focus on resolving the following priority tasks. First, we need to supply the Emergencies Ministry with modern vehicles and equipment. By 2030 new rescue equipment must make up at least 81 percent and fire engines at least 56 percent. In view of the history of cooperation with the largest manufacturers of this equipment, primarily KamAZ and Ural, the issue of signing long-term contracts must be considered while ensuring transparent pricing, cutting delivery time and streamlining servicing by signing""life-cycle"" contracts. Special care should be taken to improve the gear and equipment for firefighters and rescuers, reflecting the local climate and other peculiarities, which are different in different regions due to the huge size of the country. In addition, training equipment for Emergencies Ministry personnel must be improved, primarily for mine-rescuers. With this in mind, I will note that this year, which marks the centenary of the mine rescue service in Russia, the core facilities of the National Airmobile Rescue Training Centre for mine-rescuers and miners must begin operating. It is a crucial task, so please note that up-to-date training that meets all standards is utterly important for operating with efficiency in case of an emergency. Now, about the second aspect– organisation. The ministry's efficiency gains will largely come from eliminating duplicate structures, mainly in management and supply divisions. The resources freed up should be diverted to operational rescue and fire services and units, and also to increase the number of inspectors in supervising bodies. Third. Preventing man-made fires remains a priority. They are a grave threat to people's health and lives and are associated with large economic losses. Yes, the state is consistently removing the inspection burden on businesses, and this is the right thing to do, especially for small and medium-sized businesses. The Emergencies Ministry was among the first to assume a risk-based approach to inspection activities. However, it does not mean that if companies are not inspected in the old way, they can ignore established rules and standards, much less blatantly violate them. Responsibility for fire safety and people's health has to be of the utmost importance. I must add that the Emergencies Ministry has to get more involved with public volunteer associations and volunteers while addressing these issues. This concerns not only firefighting or emergency relief operations but also prevention work including teaching citizens safe habits. Volunteer firefighting teams and units and other associations are a great help in your work, and so we need to consider the issue of transferring retired but otherwise fully functioning equipment of the Emergencies Ministry to volunteer firefighting units. I want to stress: not faulty, retired but fully functioning, otherwise it makes no sense. Salvage and unwanted equipment cannot be just dumped on people who will not be able to use it. Instead, it would only be a hazard. Fourth– the development of the emergencies and rescue infrastructure in the Arctic region. Significant federal funding is to be allocated to address this task. For example, providing the Emergencies Ministry with latest Arctic-type helicopters will cost over 18 billion rubles. In 2021, the formation of a rescue centre in Pevek, Chukotka Autonomous Area began; it was scheduled to begin and is reported to have already begun. However, note that this work requires more interaction with large companies that have hydrocarbon extraction and processing facilities in the Arctic such as Novatek and Rosneft. All that will allow for more efficient use of budget funds. And, finally, fifth. The ongoing work on increasing the efficiency of the civil defence system must be continued. The state, for its part, will continue to further enhance social guarantees for those employed by the Ministry. Over a thousand of the Ministry's employees have been provided with housing in the past three years. Allowances for service personnel and employee wages were duly adjusted. I know that some problems remain here, but this work will continue, obviously. I am confident that Emergencies Ministry personnel will act professionally and decisively to address the issues raised today and other challenges facing the Ministry. I wish you success in your work for the good of Russia and our citizens. Thank you. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67789,Press statements following Russian-Brazilian talks,2022-02-16T17:10:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow","Following Russian-Brazilian talks, Vladimir Putin and President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro made statements for the press.","President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues, I would like to begin by thanking the President of the Federative Republic of Brazil, Mr Jair Bolsonaro for accepting my invitation to come to Russia on an official visit. This is the President's first visit to Russia. Let me note that relations between Russia and Brazil have traditionally been based on friendship and understanding. The strategic partnership between the two countries includes many diverse areas. Together, we want to develop political, economic and cultural ties, and cooperate closely on the global stage, at the UN, in BRICS, and in the G20, among others. And today we have had quite substantive and constructive talks. Following the talks, we adopted a joint statement that sets the guidelines for the further development of Russian-Brazilian cooperation. Our countries are definitely interested in progressively expanding economic interaction. Brazil is one of Russia's leading trade partners in Latin America and the Caribbean, accounting for one third of all our trade with this region. Last year, bilateral trade grew by 87 percent despite coronavirus-related complications. The intergovernmental commission plays an important role in strengthening bilateral trade and investment ties. The latest session was held in autumn of last year in Brasilia. At that time, under personal instructions from President Bolsonaro, key Brazilian government ministers in the economic sector, responsible for energy, the mining industry and agriculture, visited Russia. In addition, we plan to soon hold a meeting of the High-Level Russian-Brazilian Commission co-chaired by the Russian Prime Minister and the Brazilian Vice President. The Russian-Brazilian and Brazilian-Russian Councils of Entrepreneurs are working well together; they have timed a series of meetings of business representatives to the current visit by the President of Brazil, and tonight Mr Bolsonaro will speak with the business leaders on these councils. Let me emphasise that Brazil is always widely represented at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. Last year, Mr Bolsonaro greeted the participants of the SPIEF plenary session via videoconference, which we highly appreciated. Once again, I would like to thank you, Mr President, for your attention to our event in St Petersburg. We expect that this year's 25th forum, scheduled for June 15–18, will be attended by a high-profile delegation of Brazilian politicians, business leaders and public activists. We note with satisfaction that our bilateral industrial cooperation is successfully expanding. And I would like to highlight the projects involving the Russian corporation Power Machines to modernise the Brazilian hydropower industry, as well as the Severstal and AVISMA projects to supply components for Brazilian high-tech industries. Russia's Rosatom exports fuel for Brazilian nuclear power plants and radioisotopes for medical purposes. Rosatom is also interested in participating in the construction of new power units in Brazil, including low-capacity nuclear power plants, both land and floating plants, because it has unique and extensive experience, and technologies that are not available elsewhere in the world. Cooperation in the chemical industry and the production of environmentally friendly mineral fertiliser is progressing at a good pace. In 2021, Russian companies supplied almost 10 million tonnes of fertilisers worth about $3.5 billion to the Brazilian market. Roscosmos and the Brazilian Space Agency are working on the implementation of the agreement on cooperation on the BRICS Remote Sensing Satellite Constellation. Three GLONASS stations have already been built in Brazil, as well as an electronic optical orbital debris spotter, and there are agreements to deploy two additional stations. Russian-Brazilian cooperation in medicine and pharmaceuticals has been gaining momentum of late. Our companies ChemRar and BIOCAD are active in promoting coronavirus and cancer drugs in the Brazilian market. A project to localise Sputnik V vaccine manufacturing in Brazil is being implemented with support from the Russian Direct Investment Fund. During our talks with President Bolsonaro, we naturally discussed the issues of cultural interaction. We agreed to continue promoting bilateral education, cultural and sports exchanges. For example, a range of initiatives are being worked out now for Russia to participate in the celebrations of the bicentenary of Brazil's independence later this year. I will also mention that Russia provides assistance to Brazil in personnel training. We have about 400 Brazilian students in Russia, about 80 of whom are studying tuition-free. A Russian-Brazilian inter-cultural school has recently been opened in Rio de Janeiro where classes are taught in Russian and Portuguese. You may also recall that a Bolshoi Theatre school has been operating for over 20 years in the Brazilian city of Joinville. Over 250 young people from different areas of Brazil and other Latin American countries train at this unique school, the only one of its kind outside Russia. While sharing opinions on regional and global issues, the parties stated that Russia's and Brazil's positions on many issues are close or overlap. The foreign and defence ministries maintain contact. Actually, the foreign and defence ministers of the two countries had their first ever meeting in the 2+2 format in Moscow this morning. Our countries advocate the development of a multipolar world order based on international law with the central coordinating role of the UN. Given that, we are firmly committed to the principle of multilateralism and the political-diplomatic settlement of conflicts. In view of Brazil's status as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in 2022–2023, we are set to pursue our interaction more intensively across all current issues on the UN agenda. And we will, of course, continue to cooperate with our Brazilin partners within BRICS– a respected international association that holds an important place in the contemporary multipolar world and plays an important role in the global economy. To conclude, I would like to thank Mr Bolsonaro for our meeting. I believe that today's talks will serve to further strengthen Russian-Brazilian relations to the benefit of our two peoples. And finally, Mr President, I know of yesterday's disaster in Brazil: heavy rains caused destruction and claimed lives. I want to express my condolences to you and to all the people of Brazil over this tragedy and to wish a speedy recovery to the injured. Thank you for your attention. President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro Bolsonaro JairPresident of Brazil(retranslated): Mr President, We talked for almost two hours; the agenda was extensive and of great interest to both our countries. I am grateful to you for your condolences. People in Petropolis and Rio de Janeiro were affected by this natural disaster. Thank you. Mr President, we share common values: faith in God and protecting family values. We stand in solidarity with all countries that seek and do all they can to achieve peace. We work together closely at such international venues as BRICS, the G20 and the UNO where we defend the sovereign right of nations to self-determination in line with the UN Charter and international law. We noted the return of bilateral trade to pre-pandemic levels. Brazil is a major player in agriculture and we are pleased to see that there is interest in fertiliser supplies. We also see interested in supplies of animal-based products. We have vast potential for developing cooperation in the sphere of oil, petroleum products and natural gas. We are striving to strengthen our high-level dialogue on oil exploration and production in deep-water deposits. We are interested in small nuclear power plants. We are pleased to note the holding of the first military-political consultations between our foreign and defence ministers. We are very happy that the Amazon is part of humanity's heritage and we are grateful to you for your words in defence of our sovereignty. Thank you very much. President Putin and I consider very important the efforts to create new dynamics in the technological alliance between Brazil and Russia. We are paying significant attention to nanotechnology, biotechnology, IT and medical research. Brazil and Russia have the world's biggest forests and we decided to establish a dialogue on forest protection. Our meeting that lasted for almost two hours, I repeat, was very productive. It shows that two big powers have enormous potential for progress for the benefit of our nations. Let me repeat that the world is our home and God is above us. We stand for peace and are ready to support all those who do the same. We support all. Mr Putin, thank you very much for the warm welcome, the issues we discussed at today's meeting and the trust placed in our country. Thank you very much."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67774,News conference following Russian-German talks,2022-02-15T17:50:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow","Following Russian-German talks, Vladimir Putin and Federal Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz made statements for the press and answered journalists' questions.","President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Federal Chancellor, ladies and gentlemen, It is a pleasure to welcome the Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany in the Kremlin. Mr Scholz is visiting Russia for the first time as head of the German government. However, during his tenure as the First Mayor of Hamburg, he, in particular, largely contributed to the development of sister city partnership with St Petersburg. This year in fact marks the 65th anniversary of those ties. During today's talks, which took place in a business-like atmosphere, we substantively and thoroughly discussed various aspects of bilateral relations and prospects for their development. We also focused on the most pressing items on the international agenda. I have mentioned more than once that Germany is one of Russia's key partners. We have always strived to strengthen interaction between our states. We have the impression that the Federal Chancellor, too, is interested in further pragmatic and mutually beneficial cooperation with Russia. This applies primarily to economic ties, which are as intensive as ever. Germany is Russia's second biggest foreign trading partner after China. Despite the difficulties caused by the coronavirus pandemic and volatility in global markets, by the end of 2021, mutual trade grew by 36 percent and reached almost US$57 billion. German investment in the Russian economy exceeds US$21 billion, while Russian investment in Germany amounts to US$10 billion. About 4,000 companies co-owned by German investors are operating in Russia. We regularly meet with the management of major German companies. I can say that these meetings will certainly continue; they are extremely important for taking into account our German partners' opinion, in order to create a suitable atmosphere, a business atmosphere in the Russian market. This is very useful for us because entrepreneurs often make constructive proposals for improving the general business and investment climate in Russia. We heed many of these proposals, develop them and put them into practice. Energy is an important part of bilateral economic cooperation. As early as the 1970s our countries successfully implemented their landmark gas-for-pipes project. Since then, Russia has reliably supplied gas to Germany and other European countries. Today, Russia provides over a third of Germany's energy needs– both oil(34 percent) and natural gas(35 or even 35.4 percent). In 2021, Germany received 50.7 billion cubic metres of Russian gas. I would like to note that even during the high exchange quotes for gas and the shortage in Europe, we have continued to deliver fuel to German customers for the prices in our long-term contracts. As you know, the national regulator of the Federal Republic is charged with certifying the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which has technically been complete since last December. This is one of Europe's largest infrastructure projects. It is designed to substantially enhance energy security in Europe and facilitate the resolution of pan-European economic and environmental goals. As I have said on many occasions, this is strictly a commercial project without any hint of politics. I would also like to note that we are ready to continue distributing gas through Ukraine even after 2024 when the current contract for the transit of Russian gas through Ukraine expires. Naturally, we will do this if there is demand from European importers, if it is profitable and if Ukraine's gas transport system is in proper technical shape. We see many prospects for expanding Russian-German cooperation in other energy areas, including the development, commercialisation and use of renewable energy sources. We have talked about this as regards hydrogen. A bilateral working group on sustainable energy is already holding a dialogue on all these issues. We are also interested in closer cooperation with our German partners on issues of preserving the climate. Russia has suggested several areas for cooperation in this respect. I would like to mention the development of methods to monitor the emission and absorption of substances that have a direct impact on climate change; improvement of technology for reducing carbon dioxide and methane emissions; and the large-scale introduction of hydrogen that I mentioned as a""green fuel."" We also discussed the humanitarian agenda. We have a genuine mutual interest in the further development of bilateral scientific, educational and cultural exchanges. The Petersburg Dialogue Russian-German public forum will certainly play a role here. Of course, we have exchanged, with complete frankness, our views on the situation with Russia's initiatives and proposals to the United States and NATO regarding the provision of long-term legally binding security guarantees for Russia. We also talked about the main demands, the most important ones being to preclude any further eastward expansion by NATO, to refrain from deploying strike weapons near Russian borders, and to take NATO's military potential and infrastructure in Europe back to its 1997 configuration, the year the Russia-NATO Founding Act was signed. Russia cannot turn a blind eye to the United States and the North Atlantic Alliance interpreting the key principles of equal and indivisible security, as enshrined in many pan-European documents, so loosely as to suit their own interests. Let me remind you that equal and indivisible security spans more than the right to freely choose methods of ensuring one's security and entering into military alliances and blocs, which our colleagues keep reiterating; it also refers to a commitment to not strengthen one's own security at the expense of other states. At the same time, NATO continues to cite its""open door policy."" We know what Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty is about, and I have already spoken about this here in this room at previous news conferences following talks with our European partners. Article 10 says nothing of the kind. It says,""the Parties may invite,"" not they""must invite."" This is all it says. We see the forceful containment of Russia as a direct and immediate threat to our national security; legal agreements based on the drafts we have proposed would in fact remove this threat. I will repeat that in our view US and NATO responses to our proposals on security guarantees do not meet the three fundamental Russian requirements. However, as the Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation reported yesterday, the responses still contain a number of considerations that we are not only ready to discuss but that we have actually suggested to our partners over the years. I am referring to our proposals on European security, certain weapons systems, notably, intermediate and shorter-range missiles, and military transparency. We are ready to continue this joint work. We are also ready to follow the negotiating track, but all issues, as we said before, must be considered in a package, without being separated from Russia's fundamental proposals, which we consider an unconditional priority. Naturally, the issue of European security was also discussed in the context of the situation around a settlement of the conflict in Ukraine. As you know, the Kiev authorities are refusing to abide by the Minsk Agreements and the 2015 arrangements, as well as the agreements reached at later summits in the Normandy format, including in Berlin and Paris. There is no progress on such important issues as constitutional reform, amnesty, local elections or the special legal status of Donbass. So far, Ukraine's legislature has not confirmed the Frank-Walter Steinmeier Formula, as put forth by Germany's former foreign minister and current President. He suggested this formula as a compromise for implementing the key points of the Minsk Agreements. Unfortunately, this has not yet been carried out. Opportunities for restoring the country's territorial integrity via a direct dialogue with Donetsk and Lugansk continue to be ignored, like before. Ukraine is systematically violating human rights on a large scale and continues to endorse discrimination against Russian speakers at the legislative level. We also reviewed a number of other international issues, including the situation with Iran's nuclear programme. We are permanently in contact on this issue at the foreign minister level. I will say that our positions are rather close on this issue. In conclusion, I would like to thank Mr Federal Chancellor for our joint efforts, and a useful and meaningful dialogue. Thank you for your attention. Federal Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz Scholz OlafFederal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany(retranslated): Ladies and gentlemen, It is important and good to be here in Moscow today. Thank you for the reception and the in-depth talks. You have already heard from the President that we did not pass by a single issue in our countries' relations or European relations that matter for international relations. It is good because it is important that we really talked to each other. Our countries are historically and culturally very closely connected, our relations are deep and varied. It is evidenced, for instance, by over 90 active partnerships between our cities and by lively cultural, educational and youth exchanges. The Year of Germany has just finished in Russia. More than a thousand events in over 70 cities have covered the entire spectrum of our relations– culture, science, environment, sustainable development and gender diversity. Our economic cooperation has big potential, as you have heard. It concerns such crucial issues as decarbonisation, renewable energy sources, hydrogen and digitalisation. We can bear responsibility for climate change only if we bear it together, and it is crucial that this issue remain important in Germany and Russia's relations in the future, too. Energy is being delivered today but the question is how to make the industrialised world work neutrally in terms of carbon emissions. An indispensable element of our relations is the dialogue between our societies which made a great contribution to mutual understanding and reconciliation of our nations after World War II. All that should be supported further, and this is why we spoke about the St Petersburg Dialogue. It has been for many years a symbol of German-Russian mutual understanding, and today it is more important than ever. Therefore, I expressed hope that we will find solutions during subsequent high-level talks in order to lift the blockade we are experiencing at the moment. We need space for open and candid dialogue in order to discuss all issues and so that everyone can join in the dialogue. We are watching with concern as the space for action by civil society becomes smaller and smaller. There are partners with whom we have been working for a long time. I will name Memorial by way of example. We in Germany fail to understand why Memorial has to stop its activities. This organisation made an important contribution to uncovering the fates of Soviet people carted off to Nazi Germany for forced labour. I hope some positive prospects are possible here. I also expressed the hope that Deutsche Welle will be able to continue its journalistic activities in Russia. There is a broad range of issues of bilateral interest but we did not avoid crucial topics, either. This speaks to the character of the talks, and it is important. My visit is taking place during a crisis, the most serious and threatening crisis in many decades in Europe. During the talks, we spent significant time on Russia's military activity and build-up on the border with Ukraine, as well as on the security guarantees formulated by Russia. I expressed my views on security. I explained how we and our European partners assess the situation. I said they regard the military build-up as a threat. I must emphasise in this context that we are very concerned over the massing of 100,000 troops on the Ukrainian border for no apparent reason. This is why urgent de-escalation is necessary. It is very important to prevent war in this tense situation. During our talks, President Putin told me about his consultations with[Russia's] Foreign and Defence ministers. He spoke about this. I agree, diplomatic opportunities have not yet been exhausted. Now it is necessary to work with dedication and courage to peacefully resolve this crisis. We are hearing that some units are being withdrawn and this is a good sign. We hope this trend will continue. We are ready, together with our EU and NATO partners and allies, and with Russia, to speak about concrete steps on enhancing mutual, or more precisely, common security. NATO has already proposed holding issue-oriented talks at the NATO-Russia Council level. Poland, the OSCE Chair, has launched a new dialogue process at the top level. This dialogue will be conducted in the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual recognition of the principles we jointly agreed upon in the OSCE. These principles include the inviolability of borders, sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states, including Ukraine, and this is not up for debate for us. I suggest we discuss all these things as part of a dialogue. We must not end up at an impasse, which would be a disaster for all of us. It is quite obvious for the Federal Government that further military aggression against Ukraine will entail serious political, economic and strategic consequences. It seemed to me that everybody understands this clearly. Such an escalation should be avoided by all means, with resolve and wisdom. The search for diplomatic solutions was one of the key reasons for my visit to Kiev yesterday and today's visit to Moscow. President Putin and I share the opinion that the Normandy format, along with talks between Russia and the US, at the NATO-Russia Council and OSCE, is another crucial format for settling this conflict. Movement is needed here, and, of course, progress. And so, it is good that President Zelensky made a firm commitment yesterday that very soon all draft laws on the status of Eastern Ukraine, amendments to the Constitution and preparations for elections will be presented to the Trilateral Contact Group which operates within the Minsk process and where all the stakeholders meet. This is a good move, and it should be followed up. I urged the President to invest his negotiators with a similarly constructive mandate in the interests of achieving progress. To conclude, I will say the following: it is absolutely clear for us, Germans, and for all Europeans that sustainable security cannot be built against Russia but only with Russia. We are united on this point, both in NATO and the European Union. Therefore, a solution must be found. However difficult the situation is now, I would not call it desperate. Now we must act courageously and responsibly. I will say that war in Europe has become unimaginable for my generation, and we must make sure it remains so. Our duty as heads of state and government is to prevent a military escalation in Europe. Question(retranslated): Michaela Kuefner, Deutsche Welle. President Putin, you sent a signal that you want a dialogue but at the same time you are criticising the Federal Chancellor for not bringing enough in his suitcase. You are saying that President Zelensky's promise is not enough. All Europeans are asking themselves: Will there be a war in Europe despite close ties with Russia? Do you rule out war in Europe? And, Mr Federal Chancellor, I have a question for you. What do you think about the situation after this conversation? Was there the progress you expected? And what should be the next step? Vladimir Putin: As for war in Europe, the Federal Chancellor has just said that the people of his generation– and I belong to this generation– can hardly imagine a war in Europe. Of course, he referred to the situation around Ukraine. But we all witnessed a war in Europe that was unleashed by the NATO bloc against Yugoslavia. A large military operation with missile and bomb attacks on a European capital, Belgrade. This was done without the UN Security Council sanction. This is a very unfortunate example, but it did take place. This is the first point. Now the second point– whether we want it or not. Of course, not. This is exactly why we suggested negotiations that should produce an agreement on equal security for all, including our country. Unfortunately– and we already spoke about this– we did not receive a detailed, constructive response to our proposals. Nonetheless, we believe that even the documents sent to us by our partners from NATO and Washington contain some elements for discussion. But we are ready to do this only in conjunction with the fundamental issues that are of primary importance to us. We hope– and I told the Federal Chancellor about this today– that the dialogue will take exactly this shape. Depending on how it proceeds, the situation will likewise proceed on all other tracks that are of concern to you and us. Believe me, they worry us just like you. Olaf Scholz: I think in the current situation, it is important to use all opportunities, not to miss a single opportunity for a peaceful outcome. This is why I said that we consider the Minsk process an important prerequisite with the relevant draft laws. I think this will help jumpstart the talks on these proposals in the Trilateral Contact Group. This is a good starting point for achieving a peaceful settlement of the situation in Ukraine between Donbass and the Ukrainian government. What is important to me? The talks must be held in the Trilateral Contact Group because that is the Minsk Agreements. We are moving towards making this possible. I will emphasise that the situation in Yugoslavia was somewhat different. There was a danger and a threat of genocide, and this ought to have been prevented. I am very glad that everything is going peacefully there and that the Balkan nations have found a future in the European Union. All this is a very good sign. Vladimir Putin: I will allow myself just to add that, in our view, what is happening in Donbass today is, in fact, genocide. Question: Maria Glebova, RIA Novosti. I would like to ask a big question that covers a broad range of issues, if I may. Mr Chancellor, you have come from Kiev, where you met with President Zelensky. Do you think that Kiev wants to and will implement the Minsk agreements as they were signed? What is the outlook for a peaceful settlement? Mr Putin, a partial troop withdrawal has been reported this morning. And then news from the State Duma indicated that the deputies have asked you to recognise the Lugansk and Donetsk people's republics. Will you comment on this news, please? I would also like to ask both leaders about Nord Stream 2. What are the prospects for implementing this project in light of tensions and numerous threats regarding it? Mr Putin, I have one more question. Your old friend, Mr Schroeder, has been nominated for Gazprom's Board of Directors. This has provoked a storm of criticism in Europe. What can you say on this account? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: First I will speak about the vote in the State Duma. I received the news from the Presidential Executive Office right before this news conference. And second, about the partial withdrawal of troops from the area of our military exercises. What is there to comment on? There is nothing to comment on when the issue concerns executive authorities, including the country's military and political leadership. Yes, a decision has been made to pull out part of the troops. As for the vote in the State Duma, I believe that this issue is connected, in one way or another, to the fact that members of parliament in any country, including Russia, adjust their actions to public opinion and the opinion of their electorate, which they are keenly aware of. It is obvious in this context that the overwhelming majority of people in our country feel sympathy for people in Donbass, support them and hope that the situation would improve dramatically. I know that there were two draft documents. One was presented by United Russia, which has an overwhelming majority, and the other, more sharply worded initiative provided for making a direct request to the President on recognising these republics. I am told that the vote was open and free, which means that party discipline was not applied in this case, and the majority of deputies voted for the resolution submitted by an opposition party, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. We, and I will proceed from the assumption that we must do all we can to solve the problems of Donbass, but do this, as the Federal Chancellor has said, based on the still unused potential of the Minsk agreements. We are quite hopeful that our partners, both overseas and in Europe, primarily the Federal Republic and France, will bring influence to bear on the current Kiev authorities, and a solution will be found. Now let us talk about Mr Schroeder and Nord Stream 2. I told the Federal Chancellor this today. In the early 2000s, we came to terms with Ukraine(at that time, Ukraine was headed by President Kuchma, the German Government was represented by Mr Schroeder, and Russia– by your humble servant) and signed an agreement on creating an international consortium with the participation of Russia, Ukraine, Germany and, possibly, other European partners. The consortium was supposed to manage Ukraine's Gas Transportation System(GTS). It was neither a purchase, nor an appropriation deal. The GTS was to remain Ukraine's property, while the consortium would only lease and manage the system, investing funds and resources in its maintenance and development. Later, the new Ukrainian leadership in the person of Mr Yushchenko withdrew from this agreement. After that, questions arose as to how to ensure safe deliveries to Germany and Europe as a whole, and Mr Schroeder supported the construction of Nord Stream 1. Today, Germany receives 55 billion cubic metres of gas along this route. This gas is shipped under long-term contracts at prices that are three, four, five, or even seven times lower(if we take the peak prices on Europe's spot market) than they are at present. They were seven times– now about five times lower than on the spot market. German consumers, both industrial and private, the households, receive gas from Russia at prices that are five times lower. Let German citizens open their purses, have a look inside and ask themselves whether they are ready to pay three to five times more for electricity, for gas and for heating. If they are not, they should thank Mr Schroeder because this is his achievement, a result of his work. Regarding his presence in Gazprom's managerial bodies, many Europeans are now worried whether Russia will regularly deliver energy resources to Europe and to Germany, in particular. I believe that if the decision is made and Mr Schroeder becomes a member of the Gazprom Management Board, the purpose would be to conduct oversight as an independent expert. In this sense, Mr Schroeder is, of course, an independent expert. He is an honest man whom we respect and whose goal is first and foremost to promote the interests of his own country, the Federal Republic of Germany. In any event, the Federal Republic and all Europeans will have a person who can influence the adoption of various decisions as a member of the Gazprom Management Board, and will be able to obtain objective information directly from Gazprom. I believe that this only benefits our cooperation. We can only feel happy about this. Will this be accomplished or not? To the best of my knowledge, elections are scheduled for June. This matter rests with Gazprom and independent experts, including Mr Schroeder. Regarding Nord Stream-2… By the way, Mr Schroeder's work on the Gazprom Management Board is a natural consequence of his work on the Nord Steam-1 and Nord Stream-2 projects. He also chairs the Nord Stream project's Board. I would like to note that five German companies, including two major German energy companies, co-finance the project. Nord Stream-2 has been ready for commercial operation since December 2021. The only remaining issue is that the German regulator needs to make the decision on launching gas deliveries via this route, and this is it. Olaf Scholz: The first question was on the Minsk agreements. Everyone must comply with them. This concerns the Ukrainian government and, of course, Russia, Germany and France, which are involved in the political process. This is why it is so important for everybody to contribute. One kind of contribution is presenting the necessary draft laws for discussion on how to deal with the three major tasks that I mentioned in the beginning: the status of Donbass, elections, the Steinmeier formula, and, obviously, constitutional issues. All these matters will be presented and discussed in the trilateral format between Russia, Ukraine, the OSCE and other parties involved. We agreed on this and this process needs everybody's support, without dragging our feet. Of course, there may be different interpretations, but the words are on paper. Of course, extensive discussions are required, but it will be the next step. This is my expectation, and all conditions are in place. If everybody could shake themselves up and move forward, we can succeed. Of course, if parliament adopts the proposals today and they become reality, it will be a violation of the Minsk agreements, which means the process will be disrupted. That would be a political disaster. Settlement is possible only if everybody returns to adhering to the Minsk agreements, which set forth perfectly clear criteria. As concerns Nord Stream 2, I do not want to comment on the economic activity of a former politician, who speaks on his own behalf, not on the behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany. As for the pipeline itself, we all know very well what is happening. We undertook obligations to secure gas transit to Europe via Ukraine, Belarus and Poland using Nord Stream 1, as agreed, and we are delivering on these obligations. We want to ensure peaceful development in Europe, without military confrontation in Ukraine. And if confrontation happens, it will entail serious repercussions. Everybody understands this. We know what to do in this case and it seems to me that everybody else knows and understands it too. They understand what is going on and understand the potential political repercussions. Therefore, right now, it is important to prevent this kind of situation and choose peace, thus showing true political leadership, without pointing fingers, but making one's own contribution to maintaining peace. This should be our goal. Question(retranslated): Mr Federal Chancellor, a question for you. You mentioned some complicated issues in German-Russian relations. You spoke about Memorial and Deutsche Welle. There are other topics as well, such as the Navalny case, whose trial has started today. There is also the forced medical examination for foreigners in Russia and cyberattacks on Germany. Did you mention these too? How did President Putin react? What would be your general overview of German-Russian relations? My question for President Putin concerns the first steps to withdraw troops. What will be happening in the next few days and weeks? Will the pulling out of forces continue? Can you now rule out an attack on Ukraine? And a question concerning Ukraine's accession to NATO. Chancellor Scholz and other NATO heads of state and government are not ready to guarantee that Ukraine will not be allowed to join NATO but perhaps you envision some kind of moratorium? NATO representatives have said that Ukraine's accession is simply unrealistic in the next few years and even decades. Olaf Scholz: Yes, we have touched on many topics. As concerns Navalny, my stance here is absolutely clear: a prison sentence in his case goes against legal standards of a state that abides by the rule of law. I have stressed this many times. Vladimir Putin: I believe now our guest will give me an opportunity to answer your question. First. What will Russia do next? Russia will act according to plan. What is the plan? The plan is based on the actual situation on the ground. Who can say how the actual situation will develop? Nobody at this point. There are other parties to consider. But it is our intention and resolve to reach agreement with our partners on the matters we put on the table, by diplomatic means. These matters are well known: with respect to Russia's security, it is the non-expansion of NATO and the withdrawal of the bloc's military infrastructure to the 1997 positions, and non-deployment of missile strike systems near our borders. I think everything is clear. We are open to discussing other matters stated in the response we received– but in conjunction with the issues that constitute priority to us. What was the second part of your question? Remark: Withdrawal of troops and weapons from the Ukrainian border and expansion of NATO. Vladimir Putin: I have already spoken on the withdrawal. I think I gave you an answer to this part. As for the expansion of NATO. You said remarkable words:""NATO representatives have said that Ukraine's accession is simply unrealistic in the next few years."" What does it mean,""they have said""? We need to understand what""they have said"" means in relations between states. For 30 years, we have been told that there will be no NATO expansion whatsoever, not by an inch towards the Russian border. And now we see NATO infrastructure right outside our home. Moreover, there is a discussion of Ukraine's accession to NATO. As you said, they say it will not happen tomorrow. But when will it happen? The day after tomorrow? What does it change for us in the historical perspective? Nothing at all. We hear that Ukraine is not ready to join NATO today. We are aware of this statement. Then they say immediately that NATO will not accept it tomorrow. Will they accept Ukraine once they have prepared it for accession? It may be too late for us then, so we want to address this issue now, right now, immediately, through negotiations and by peaceful means. This is our understanding of the process, and we really hope that our partners will hear our concerns and take them seriously. Question: My first question is for President Putin. Yesterday, at a meeting with Sergei Lavrov, you coordinated the reply on guarantees for Russia and agreed that there were prospects for talks. Does this mean that Russia will enter a period of protracted talks lasting many years, while Washington and the West reject the three main provisions of the Russian initiative, which you have already spoken about? And my second question is for Mr Putin and Chancellor Scholz. As I represent RT, I must ask about the decision to ban RT DE broadcasting in Germany. Is it possible to make any headway and arrive at a constructive solution to this issue? Perhaps it would be appropriate to set up some joint working group, so that Deutsche Welle and we would be able to continue broadcasting in Germany and Russia? Vladimir Putin: As far as I know, they have already asked our guest about Deutsche Welle. Today, the Federal Chancellor and I discussed the work of Deutsche Welle in Russia and the work of RT in the Federal Republic of Germany. I do not want to go into detail now so as not to complicate the situation, but we agreed to think about how these matters can be resolved. This is the first thing. The second, regarding lengthy talks that may lead nowhere. This is precisely why I met with the Foreign Minister and my colleagues from the security services yesterday. The Security Council gives constant attention to this matter, and, of course, we are concerned about it. We have apprehensions that our partners might unjustifiably protract the talks on the security issues that are important for us, and that during this process decisions will be made, one way or another, which will seriously aggravate our situation, just as it has been happening for many years. It goes without saying that we are keeping an eye on this, and we know which matters we will be discussing with our partners, and what outcomes we will not allow to materialise. Olaf Scholz: First of all, the question you have asked about RT. This is a state governed by the rule of law, one should submit applications, and they are yet to be submitted. The relevant agencies will process them in keeping with the existing laws that are now in effect, laws that everyone can refer to and rely on. In a rule-of-law state, there are procedures, and legal preconditions must be met. As for the situation with the talks, the positions of the sides differ, as it has become clear. This is why we talked for so long. And this is good. The important thing is that we talk to each other. It is also important that NATO and the EU have responded to the letters from Russia. Of course, Russia does not agree with this, but still, it finds something positive in these answers. We also disagree– I mean NATO and the EU– with the suggestions formulated by Russia. But they also contain points that we are ready to talk about and discuss. Right now, it is necessary to prevent the emergence of a dangerous situation, which all of us would like to avoid. Everyone ought to know that these are major shifts and points of reference for further talks. The first thing to do is to solve the Ukrainian problem with a focus on the Minsk agreements. The Minsk process is afoot and everyone should abide by it. All of us must have the will to talk to each other. This also concerns the differing positions on NATO expansion. The situation is somewhat odd: no expansion is being planned; nor is it discussed, or put on the agenda. Everyone knows about it. While each of us is in office, we will not have to deal with this. I do not know how much longer Mr President will remain in his post. I think this might be a long time, but not an eternity. I mean, we will not be addressing this. Our task, therefore, is to reach political mutual understanding and a situation where no one renounces their principles. This is political leadership and the responsibility that we bear to ensure peace and international cooperation in Europe. This is always discussed when we talk about important matters, such as security, cooperation in Europe, transparency, and arms control. The desiderata are formulated, NATO has responded positively– differently from what the other side desired, but this should be used as a basis for making further headway."

I would like to note immediately that the Federal Republic of Germany ranks among our priority partners per se and in Europe in particular. Speaking of the European dimension, it is our largest trade and economic partner. In this connection, I would like to note that, despite all the difficulties of the pandemic period, the level of our trade adjusted slightly in 2020, but increased by over 36 percent last year. This is, of course, a good indicator. Hundreds of German companies operate in Russia, one way or another, and they have invested more than US$20 billion in the Russian economy. In turn, Russian companies have invested just over US$10 billion, and this is also a good contribution to the development of the German economy and maintaining jobs. Recently, we have undertaken intensive joint efforts to diversify our relations, and they are really developing in different fields– but, traditionally, the energy industry has naturally been a priority area. I will not list all the figures, which are basically well known; we can also mention this at today's news conference. Russia has been a reliable energy supplier for decades– and throughout this period, no failure has occurred in deliveries of energy resources from Russia as all our activities are based on market principles, with absolutely no questions or doubts in this regard. The partners, the participants in economic activities have known each other for quite a while, and the level of trust between them is high. Moreover, we have made a decision that is unprecedented to a certain extent– namely, we have allowed our German partners to access our production assets. We work jointly to organise transport deliveries; our companies operate in the Federal Republic of Germany. As I have mentioned, we have many other issues to discuss as well– but today we will pay particular attention to addressing the developments in Europe related to security and the contentious debates that have now unfolded on this issue, including the events around Ukraine. In any case, all of this is of great mutual interest to us. I am very glad to see you. Just recently, I received my French counterpart here, and we also thoroughly discussed all these issues. I know that he informed you on the essence of the subjects that were raised during our discussion. And of course, I would find it very useful and interesting to hear your own assessments of the current developments. Once again, welcome. I am very pleased to see you. Federal Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz(retranslated): Thank you very much. I am glad too that our meeting is taking place. I have just assumed office as Chancellor, and for me, Germany-Russia history is something special. Given our history, it is very good that we have such close economic ties, as you have noted, and that they continue to develop. It is clearly obvious that now, amidst the current complicated developments regarding peace and security in Europe, we must communicate, just as you already have with my French counterpart. I am glad that we now have this opportunity to discuss all these matters. It is very important that issues between countries are always resolved through dialogue. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67767,Meeting with Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu,2022-02-14T16:00:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation Sergei Shoigu.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Shoigu, I know that today you are ready to report on the exercises underway in various parts of the oceans, including in the Far East, the south and the north, as well as those in the Central Military District and with our friends in Belarus. Please, go ahead. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu Shoigu SergeiDefence Minister: Mr President, indeed, I wanted to give an update on the exercises today. These are large-scale exercises and they are underway in the Western Military District, involving virtually all fleets, including those in the Barents Sea, the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea and the Pacific Fleet. Military units from virtually all military districts, including the Eastern Military District, the Central Military District and the Northern Military District, are taking part in these exercises. Some of these exercises are nearing completion, and others will end in the near future. I would like to note that the exercises involved drills against various types of hypothetical enemy attacks in all areas, including those of surface ships, submarines and of blue-water navies. During the Pacific Fleet's operations, as part of an exercise near the Kuril island of Urup, we detected a submarine, presumably that of the United States. Following almost three-hour operations, the submarine was expelled from the territory of the Russian Federation. Actually, it had ventured over four kilometres into Russian territorial waters, a large distance, by local standards. We conducted special operations three times and forced the submarine to leave Russia's territorial waters. Such activity in the east is absolutely incomprehensible and unjustified. But I want to repeat once again that the exercises will proceed: some of them are over, others are nearing completion, and we still have to accomplish certain tasks, with due consideration for the scale of the exercises that were planned and launched on your instruction in December. Vladimir Putin: Ok, thank you very much. We will now go into more detail. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67766,Meeting with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov,2022-02-14T15:30:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Lavrov, we agreed today that the Foreign Ministry would present its views on the responses we received to our proposals sent to our US colleagues in Washington and our NATO colleagues in Brussels regarding security issues in Europe and their response to our concerns, primarily NATO's endless and, in our view, most dangerous eastward expansion, now aimed at reaching out to former Soviet republics, including Ukraine. I know that this analysis has been done. You also worked on it with your colleagues from other departments and ministries. Of course, I would like to hear both your analysis and your proposals on a response to the replies received from Washington and Brussels. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov Lavrov SergeiForeign Minister of Russia: Mr President, We have been working on your instructions since mid-December when we presented our initiatives to the Americans and to NATO member countries. We met with an American delegation and held a Russia-NATO Council meeting in mid-January during which we explained to our partners in detail the importance of our initiatives for resolving key security problems in the Euro-Atlantic Region. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken asked me for a separate meeting to clarify certain questions, and we had a meeting in Geneva. Several days later, on January 25, I believe, they sent us a response– a response from the United States and a response from the North Atlantic Alliance. We attentively studied these with our colleagues in the inter-departmental format. We are primarily interested in a reply from the United States since it is clear to everyone who is playing the main role in resolving these issues in the Western camp. The US response consists of two parts. In the first part, they respond to the three major issues that we outlined: NATO's non-expansion; non-deployment of strike weapons that are a threat to us; and, in general, returning military and military-technical configurations in Europe to 1997 positions when Russia and NATO signed the Founding Act that raised the task of ensuring indivisible security for the first time. The responses to these issues were negative and of course, we cannot be satisfied with them. They basically said the right of a state to choose unions and join or replace them overrides everything else and is not a subject for discussion, as it were. We are reminding the Americans and our other Western colleagues that this right, formalised in OSCE top-level decisions at the 1999 and 2010 summits, the Russia-NATO 2002 Rome Declaration, and the Lisbon Declaration of the 2010 Russia-NATO summit, is not unconditional. This right is directly conditioned by other points that were supported, let me repeat, as a package by consensus. The second part of the package basically says that each state's right to choose alliances is limited by its own commitments not to enhance its security at the expense of any other state. And there is another point here, a very important one, which runs that no country, no group of countries or no organisation can dominate in the OSCE space. Unfortunately, we are seeing an attempt by our NATO colleagues and the European Union, which is groping for its own place, to somehow have them alone determine the further progress of our continent. Therefore, during the time between the meetings you had and the ones we had through the Foreign Ministry, I sent a special address to all our Western colleagues, drawing their attention to the fact that the obligations on the indivisibility of security are much more complex and complicated than they are trying to present them as they justify Ukraine's joining NATO. They assure us, in parenthesis, that this is something that will not happen any time soon. We are well aware of how those assurances work. I have received unsatisfactory responses; none of my fellow ministers have responded to my direct address. We have received two small papers– one from an official in the office of NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg and another from an official in the office of Josep Borrell, the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. The messages read: don't worry, the dialogue must continue; the main thing you need to do is to ensure de-escalation around Ukraine. I think this is exactly a neglect of the norm as stated at the top level which says that no organisation can consider itself the main and dominant one in the Euro-Atlantic Region. So, we will continue to seek a concrete response from each country since all the documents I reported to you were signed under national status, and the responsibility for their content and the commitments under these documents must be accounted for at the national level. This is about the first part of the response, basically the Americans, which does not suit us. The second part is more constructive to a certain extent. It envisages rather specific measures to address the problems of land-based shorter and intermediate-range missiles after the Americans discarded the corresponding treaty. It also contains specific proposals on a range of measures to reduce military risks, confidence-building measures and military transparency. Interestingly, almost all of the components the Americans included in their response reflect initiatives that the Russian Federation has been promoting over the past few years. With regard to shorter and intermediate-range missiles, we have been waiting for a response to your address since September 2020, where you proposed agreeing on reciprocal and mutually verifiable moratoriums on the deployment of these types of weapons in Europe. Nobody ever responded. The proposals from our General Staff, sent to NATO in 2020, included measures to move military exercises away from the line of contact between Russia and NATO and to agree on a minimum distance for the rapprochement of military aircraft and warships, as well as a number of other military-technical confidence-building measures. Those two have been left without attention. As of today, however, we have seen some very specific responses to the initiatives we advanced earlier. The other side is demonstrating a willingness to enter into serious negotiations. It is clear that our initiative on European security, on security guarantees we put forward and are strongly promoting, clearly stating our fundamental interests in this, has given our Western colleagues a shake. This is why they are no longer able to just ignore many of our previous calls. So, I would say we can consider further progress in these areas, but only while maintaining the integrity of our December 2021 initiative, maintaining an integrated approach. This approach is broader than reaching some specific agreements on industry-specific, isolated, secondary aspects of maintaining military security, important though they are; but above all, this approach is about the legal settlement of issues that generally threaten the Euro-Atlantic Region. I am referring to where we started with in our initiatives, when you repeatedly emphasised, including during your recent telephone conversations and news conferences– we need to ensure indivisible security, including with regard to NATO's non-expansion, non-deployment of strike weapons and returning to its 1997 configuration. We at the Foreign Ministry are convinced that this approach must remain a priority. In developing a dialogue on some aspects that are of practical importance today, with our Western, primarily American colleagues, we will be seeking in parallel their responses to the legitimate concerns that we have raised and that you have repeatedly confirmed, including at the news conference with Emmanuel Macron. I believe you have very clearly described the potential for drawing Ukraine into NATO under these conditions, considering Kiev's ambitions. Vladimir Putin: Mr Lavrov, do you think we still have a chance of coming to terms with our partners on the key problems of our concern or is this simply an attempt to drag us into an endless negotiating process with no logical conclusion? Sergei Lavrov: Mr President, you have said more than once– you and other representatives of the Russian Federation have said– that we are warning that an endless discussion on the issues that must be resolved today is unacceptable. That said, as the head of the Foreign Ministry, I must say that there is always a chance. I am referring to your recent meetings with the US and French leaders; the Federal Chancellor of Germany is coming tomorrow; our colleagues are addressing me: the Polish Foreign Minister will be here tomorrow; the Italian Foreign Minister will come here in two days, and other meetings are being planned. We have consistently conducted explanatory work; we are committed to explaining why we are right, and that we are ready to listen to serious counter arguments. That said, I think our opportunities are far from exhausted. Of course, they should not be endless, but I think we should still continue to pursue and build on them at this point. Vladimir Putin: All right. Do you have a draft response to the documents that Brussels and Washington sent us? Sergei Lavrov: Yes, it proceeds from the… Vladimir Putin: I see. But has it been formulated, I mean this package? Sergei Lavrov: It was formulated on ten pages. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67761,Briefing by Aide to the President Yury Ushakov following a telephone conversation between Vladimir Putin and Joseph Biden,2022-02-12T22:00:00Z,NA,,"Yury Ushakov briefed media representatives on the telephone conversation between President of Russia Vladimir Putin and President of the United States Joseph Biden. * * * Aide to the President Yury Ushakov: Good evening! A telephone conversation between the President of the Russian Federation and the President of the United States has just concluded. It lasted for just over an hour. The call was as a follow-up of sorts on the December 7 videoconference talks between Russia and the United States, and the December 30 telephone conversation. It was during those conversations that the two leaders began discussing one of the most important issues on the current agenda, namely long-term legally binding security guarantees for the Russian Federation. Today's conversation was held, as everyone knows, against the backdrop of an unprecedented push by US official to whip up hysteria over the allegedly imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine. Incidentally, in requesting that the telephone conversation be held today, instead of on Monday as it was previously scheduled, the US cited the likelihood of this catastrophic scenario. Similar requests for urgent conversations have been filed by other members of the Biden administration, who talked over the phone with many of their Russian colleagues yesterday and today. It was thus a coordinated effort to pump out hysteria about the ""invasion,"" which is now at its height. Coming back to the conversation between the presidents of Russia and the United States, it can be said that the tone was rather balanced and business-like. President Biden even talked about the experience of his predecessors who made every effort during the Cold War to avoid the catastrophe of a serious military conflict between our two nations. He said that our two great nations were still rivals but that we must take every effort to maintain stability and security in the world. He also stressed that every effort needs to be taken to avoid the worst scenario as concerns the current situation around Ukraine. He said he was a proponent of diplomacy and laid down a whole raft of proposals that he believes reflect many of Russia's concerns and initiatives that we outlined and relayed to the US and NATO in the draft documents on security guarantees. I want to note straight away that the Russian President responded by saying that Russia was going to carefully study President Biden's proposals and would certainly pay due consideration to them. He made clear, however, that these proposals did not really address the central, key elements of Russia's initiatives either with regards to non-expansion of NATO, or non-deployment of strike weapons systems on Ukrainian territory, or NATO's return to the positions that existed at the moment of signing the 1997 Russia-NATO Founding Act. To these items, we have received no meaningful response. Many of the suggestions that were put forward during the conversation were part of the January 26 response to Russia's proposals relayed to us by Washington and NATO. Speaking about the tense situation around Ukraine, Joseph Biden made a mention, as might have been expected, of the possibility of harsh sanctions against Russia, but they were not the focus of his rather lengthy conversation with the Russian leader. Our President detailed Russia's principled approaches and explained why the time has come to resolve issues that have a direct bearing on the Russian national security. The President of Russia presented his overview of the history of relations between the US, NATO and Russia that has led to this crisis. He said, in particular, that the Soviet Union and the United States were certainly adversaries during the Cold War; and that although we were friends of sorts in the 1990s, even then the US and NATO did not pursue a constructive policy towards Russia. That was the time of NATO's practical expansion of its operations, its admitting new members and moving closer towards Russian borders. This was followed by the stark worsening of the Euro-Atlantic security architecture in the 2000s, which has had a direct impact on the security of our country. What else did I want to note? The Russian President went into equally great detail about the Ukrainian Government's destructive policies aimed at sabotaging the Minsk Agreements, which have been ongoing for the previous eight years. He noted that the West did not exert enough pressure on Kiev to follow through on its commitments under the agreements. The President of Russia also highlighted the dangers of a militarized Ukraine and the on-going injections of cutting-edge weaponry, which the West has been steadfastly involved in and which has been encouraging the Ukrainian military to stage provocations both against Donbass and Crimea. In light of Ukraine's doctrinal policy which explicitly states its goal to retake Crimea by force, the hypothetical admission of that country to NATO is fraught with dire consequences, including direct military confrontation between Russia and NATO, at the very least due the US' recognition of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty as being sacred. This is what our President spoke in detail about during the conversation. Overall, the presidents agreed that Moscow was going to carefully study the proposals put forward by President Biden and where possible, will take them into consideration in its response to the position documents drafted by the US and NATO. We will make this response known to our partners and members of the general public in the nearest future. Building on Joseph Biden's desire for the US-Russia relations to be based on mutual respect, the presidents agreed to continue contacts on various levels on all the issues discussed during the telephone conversation today. I would like to stress once again that overall, the conversation was business-like. Thank you. Question: Can you tell us if today's conversation has shed any light on US motives? If President Biden knew that he was going to talk to Vladimir Putin on the phone, why did he announce a Russian ""invasion"" on February 16, which shook the entire world? Is it possible that after the two heads of state have spoken today, President Biden can still set a new date for this ""invasion"" for tomorrow or the day after? Such a statement will only provoke further concerns globally. How are we supposed to interpret this? Yury Ushakov: You know very well that tensions have been stoked over our troops' movements on Russian territory, albeit close to the Ukrainian border, for several months now. I agree completely that the whole situation has reached absurd levels in the past days and hours. But here are the facts: the US is stoking hysteria over our so-called planned Russian ""invasion,"" giving even the dates of this ""invasion,"" all the while working jointly with its allies to build up Ukraine's ""military muscle."" Significant funds are being allocated to modernize the Ukrainian armed forces, and more military instructors are being sent there. So, the ""invasion"" chorus is a backdrop to create opportunities for possible provocations by the Ukrainian military. This is our view of the situation. Question: Is it possible the US will continue to act like this? Yury Ushakov: I don't know. It's the US that chooses to go down this road. We have made our thoughts known and have said repeatedly that we can't understand why mass media have been feeding false narratives about Russia's intentions. Question: Did the presidents discuss the incident with the US submarine in Russia's territorial waters? Yury Ushakov: No, they didn't. We are aware of the incident, and necessary actions are being taken by the Defence Ministry, but the subject was not raised during the conversation between the two presidents. Question: Can you tell us if Russia made clear what it would do in the event Ukraine's Government decided to provoke conflict in Donbass? What will Russia do then? Yury Ushakov: We emphasised, firstly, that we were going to consider the proposals put forward by President Biden today, even though they overlap to a great deal with the US and NATO responses we have already received. We also indicated that an interdepartmental discussion of possible responses was nearly finished. The results will be made public in the near future. Question: The US has already shared its views on the telephone call. In particular, they continue to claim that they still don't know if any actions follow, and what President Putin's plans are for a potential ""invasion"" of Ukraine. Yury Ushakov: To be honest, I haven't seen the American interpretation of the call yet. However, I have shared with you what we had to say on the subject. Question: Are there any discussions scheduled in the coming weeks? Yury Ushakov: Like I said, the presidents agreed that discussions on various issues should continue. In particular we will discuss the issues that Joseph Biden raised today. Naturally, we will give priority to addressing those concerns that were clearly and publicly stated in the two draft documents. Thank you."

Vladimir Putin once again drew attention to the absence of a substantive response from the United States and NATO to the Russian initiatives. He also stressed the reluctance of the leading Western powers to prompt the Kiev authorities to implement the Minsk agreements, which was demonstrated again by the futility of the February 10 round of consultations in Berlin between political advisors to the Normandy format leaders. Vladimir Putin and Emmanuel Macron also discussed the situation concerning provocative speculations regarding the allegedly planned Russian""invasion"" of Ukraine, which is accompanied by massive supplies of modern weaponry to Ukraine, thus creating conditions for possible aggressive actions by the Ukrainian military in Donbass. The leaders agreed to keep these issues on the agenda of the Russian-French top-level dialogue. In addition, they touched upon the preservation of and full-fledged compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Actions on Iran's nuclear programme."

Relations with the CIS member countries, in the post-Soviet space are a priority of our foreign policy course. Today we will discuss them. I would like to stress once again that, of course, this is a key topic, as I have already said. We have a lot of initiatives here and a very good dialogue with our leading partners, extensive trade; we work with many of them within the EAEU and the CSTO. Recent events show that all this work is leading to positive results and is much in demand. Today we will discuss ways to improve the mechanisms we have created in this area in recent years. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67749,Press statements following Russia-Kazakhstan talks,2022-02-10T18:15:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow","Following bilateral consultations, Vladimir Putin and President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev made press statements.","President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues, We are delighted to welcome the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Mr Tokayev, to Moscow. This is our first in-person meeting since the January events in Kazakhstan, which were an unprecedented challenge to the country's sovereignty, integrity and stability. In fact, Kazakhstan faced an act of terrorist aggression committed with the direct participation of destructive internal and external forces. Thanks to President Tokayev's firm stance and the resolute support on behalf of Russia and all allies in the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, control of the situation was regained in a short time, law and order were restored, and peace and tranquillity returned to Kazakhstan. At the same time, the CSTO has convincingly demonstrated its ability to effectively respond to emerging threats, to promptly deploy peacekeeping forces to protect the security and interests of its member states. President Tokayev is doing everything to finally normalise the situation. We see that the situation in Kazakhstan has become stable and calm. Society fully supports the course of the country's leadership towards achieving ambitious goals, and we, Russia, for our part, will do everything to support the President of Kazakhstan. We are confident that Russian-Kazakhstani cooperation will continue to expand and grow with all objective conditions for doing so in place. Naturally, the current state and prospects for further deepening bilateral cooperation was the main topic that we reviewed during today's talks. Our countries are traditionally bound by truly strong allied and neighbourly ties. This year, we will mark the 30th anniversary of our diplomatic relations. These relations are based on the principles of reliable mutual support, respect and consideration of mutual interests. Russia and Kazakhstan are key economic partners. Trade is growing even amid the relentless pandemic, and steadily at that, reaching US$25.6 billion in 2021. Cumulative Russian investments in Kazakhstan amount to US$17 billion whereas Kazakhstan investments stand at US$4.6 billion. Russian business is broadly represented in all areas of Kazakhstan's economy. The republic has around 7,500 business entities with Russian capital. The two countries' companies are successfully working together in the fuel and energy sector. Most of Kazakhstan's oil goes to foreign markets via Russia, and Russian oil is supplied to the People's Republic of China through the territory of Kazakhstan. I would single out mineral fertilizers, iron casting, cargo equipment components, automobiles and automobile tyres among significant joint projects. A project is underway in Kazakhstan for the production of Kirovets tractors and spare parts to them. Work is ongoing to increase local production of Lada automobiles. Bilateral cooperation in pharmaceuticals and medicine is actively promoted. Russia came to the aid of the brotherly republic of Kazakhstan during the peak of the pandemic by sending an impressive task force of medical personnel and humanitarian cargo. Reliable production of the Russian vaccine Sputnik V has been set up at Karaganda pharmaceutical complex. In total, over six million doses of the first and the second vaccine components have already been produced. In addition, Sputnik Light vaccine is being delivered to Kazakhstan which can be used as a booster for various vaccines. Obviously, the talks covered further stepping up of military and defence industry cooperation. Russia continues to render assistance to Kazakhstan in training military specialists at the higher education establishments of the Russian Defence Ministry and other security agencies. We will keep working together on establishing in the republic licenced production facilities and maintenance centres for Russian military equipment. The President of Kazakhstan informed me that Kazakhstan is starting to implement a comprehensive plan of priority measures aimed at improving the social protection of citizens, eradicating corruption, modernising the economy, and strengthening the country's security agencies. We wish our Kazakhstani partners success with their plans and are ready to assist them in every possible way. While considering regional and global problems, we affirmed that the positions of Russia and Kazakhstan are very close or identical on most of them. Our countries firmly uphold the principles of the supremacy of international law, sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of other states. They closely coordinate efforts at key multilateral platforms, including at the United Nations. Russia and Kazakhstan are successfully advancing integration, primarily, of course, within the Eurasian Economic Union, which our Kazakhstani partners chaired last year. By the way, this year Kazakhstan chairs the Commonwealth of Independent States. We will certainly provide our Kazakhstani friends with all the assistance they need. I would like to take this opportunity to once again thank President Tokayev for supporting Moscow's bid to host the world exhibition EXPO-2030. We also greatly appreciate Kazakhstan's agreement to be this year's partner country of our International Industrial Trade Fair INNOPROM, which traditionally takes place in Yekaterinburg. I can also mention that during our talks I invited the President of Kazakhstan to take part in the St Petersburg International Economic Forum in June this year as one of the key guests. We hope that he will accept our invitation, and we always anticipate a large delegation of Kazakhstani politicians, businessmen and public figures to the forum in St Petersburg. In closing, I would like to express my gratitude to the President for the productive work we did together today. During the current visit, the President of Kazakhstan will visit one of the dynamically developing regions of Russia– the Republic of Tatarstan, which closely cooperates with our Kazakhstani partners. I am convinced that today's talks will help further strengthen the allied relations between Russia and Kazakhstan for the benefit of the fraternal peoples of the two countries. Thank you for your attention. President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev Tokayev Kassym-JomartPresident of the Republic of Kazakhstan: Mr President, Ladies and gentlemen, First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the President of the Russian Federation for his invitation to come to Moscow on an official visit. We have just completed our long talks with the agreements President Putin has described in detail. It is true that the talks were very substantive and interesting, I would say. I would like to take this opportunity to express my satisfaction with these talks. This year is a milestone for our states: we are marking the 30th anniversary of our diplomatic relations. Over this time, we have built truly exemplary interstate cooperation based on our strong ties of friendship, common history and the similar mentality of our peoples. Thanks to our intense political dialogue, we have achieved impressive success in almost all areas. Our common land border, the longest in the world, is a clear example of real, I would say, exemplary neighbourliness, reliable cooperation and strategic partnership to the entire international community. As I have already said, the talks concerned almost all aspects of cooperation between our states, such as our economic and investment ties, and, of course, our approaches to the main international problems. We discussed the main topics on the Russian-Kazakhstani agenda openly, in an atmosphere of trust, and were satisfied to note the highly successful development of comprehensive contacts between our countries. Considering the enormous potential of our mutually beneficial cooperation, we reaffirmed our shared intention to strengthen political, economic, investment and cultural ties. We have agreed to maintain positive momentum in bilateral trade. Just now President Putin has cited convincing figures achieved in this very important, even key, area of trade and economic cooperation. Despite the pandemic and quarantine restrictions, the highest result has indeed been achieved. Last year, trade exceeded US$21 billion. Russian companies are in the top five investors in the economy of Kazakhstan. Their total investment exceeded US$17 billion. In Kazakhstan, Russia is by far the leader in terms of the number of enterprises with foreign capital. Every third enterprise was created with the participation of Russian companies, with their total investment portfolio represented by almost all industries. We discussed in detail the prospects of expanding production cooperation. Our countries have completed 13 major projects in this area. Eight projects worth over US$2.5 billion are at the stage of implementation. Work to elaborate another 11 projects with total investment volume of almost US$1.5 billion is underway. During the talks, I told President Putin that all these projects will be under my personal supervision. They are intended to create new jobs and enhance our countries' industrial and technological potential. Interregional cooperation also yields major practical results. Mutually beneficial trade between our countries and regions amounts to about 70 percent of our total trade. Productive partnership between Kazakhstan and Russia is constantly expanding through new innovative points of growth. Today we signed a number of documents which will allow our countries to advance considerably on pressing issues: digitisation, space exploration and training specialists in nuclear power engineering. Given the demand for highly qualified personnel in the engineering and technical area in Kazakhstan, we emphasised cooperation in education. During the talks, I expressed my appreciation to the President of Russia for agreeing to send branches of the most well-known Russian universities, primarily technical ones, to Kazakhstan. I think that they will make a very serious contribution to the development of education in our country. We welcome meaningful agreements on expanding the network of Russian university branches in Kazakhstan, just as I have already mentioned. I want to underscore that Kazakhstan will open well-known branches of the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute, Gubkin Russian State University of Oil and Gas, Bauman Moscow Higher Technical School– now it has a different name, evidently it has become a university, although the reputation remains. I think this is a great stride in education and mutual support in this area. We secured each other's support in promoting international initiatives. I want to make a point that Kazakhstan, without any hesitations, supported Moscow's bid to host EXPO 2030. As I already said, we exchanged views on the most pressing issues of regional and global politics. I would like to emphasise that our positions and approaches remain unchanged on the whole. The Russian Federation plays an exceptionally important role in ensuring stability and security in our region. I would like to say that we support Russia's position regarding the indivisibility of security in the Eurasian space. In the end, this principle was enshrined in the declaration signed following the 2010 OSCE Summit in Astana. We agree that in the modern world it is impossible and essentially irrational to strengthen your own security at the expense of the security of others. Therefore, I think that the proposals that were made by the Russian Federation on holding talks on security on a significant international scale are a very good platform for holding successful, I stress, successful diplomatic talks. We are in favour of holding talks not for the sake of talks, but to achieve results. After all, a bad peace is better than a good quarrel. Once again, I would like to thank President Putin and our other CSTO partners for their invaluable support in repelling a terrorist attack that was unprecedented for Kazakhstan. I think that, without any exaggeration, the current talks were some of the most important, if not the most important, that took place in recent years between Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation. I would like to take this opportunity to say that I am quite satisfied with the outcome of these talks. Once again, I express my gratitude for the hospitality and business-like approach to our meeting. Vladimir Putin:(Addressing media representatives.). Are there any questions? Question: If it is not a secret, did you have a telephone conversation yet on the results of Mr Macron's visit to Kiev? Maybe he told you something about his talks with Mr Zelensky. And what do you think of Mr Zelensky's comment on your phrase""like it or lump it, you have to fulfil them"" in which he hinted that you might have spent too much time with President Macron? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: You know, there was nothing personal to it, I should say that right off. I never get personal in my work, in all these years, so again there was nothing personal about it. The issue is that when we hear from a head of state that he likes or dislikes something about fundamental agreements that regulate very important relations between countries in terms of security, including that of Ukraine, I think it is out of place. If a state assumed certain obligations, the more so when they are enshrined in international law, UN Security Council Resolution 2202, I think, then everything must be followed and performed as agreed. That is all there is to it. Regarding talks with our European and American partners, they are ongoing both in open and closed formats; we are preparing a response to NATO and Washington. The President of France– we did indeed agree that he would call me after his series of consultations in Kiev and also in European countries and with US partners. I take it the consultations have not concluded yet, since we have not talked yet. To be honest, we actually expected questions on the state of Russia-Kazakhstan relations. For my part, I want to once again thank the President of Kazakhstan for his visit today. I realise it was not easy to find time to visit Russia since there is a lot to do back home, it goes without saying. Yet I think this visit was needed in view of the level, nature and quality of our relations, as well as their scale. Today the President of Kazakhstan informed me about the big plans to change the country's economy and the way relations in society are regulated. It is a complex and big, if not enormous, challenge, and I would like to stress again that Kazakhstan's leadership and its President have every right to count on Russia's support in all those areas of the country's development that he has outlined. That is exactly what will happen. Thank you very much. Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: Thank you."

Several documents were signed between major Russian universities and the Centre of International Programmes, Republic of Kazakhstan. In addition, a cooperation agreement was signed between Transmashholding and Kazakh Railways.*** Beginning of Russian-Kazakhstani talks President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, It is my pleasure to welcome you in Moscow. This is our first meeting after the events in January, when, without exaggeration, Kazakhstan fell victim to some international groups that used the difficult situation in the country to their benefit. We had a meeting before the New Year, and nothing could have predicted such a turn of events. Nevertheless, the balance has been restored, and, as you know, Russia, as a member country of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, provided help to Kazakhstan in accordance with Article 4 of the Treaty. Of course, the main role was played by the leadership of Kazakhstan, the law enforcement agencies and armed forces loyal to their duty, their oath, and the people of Kazakhstan. I know that now you have a great deal of work to do in order to restore everything that was lost during these events. Nevertheless, thanks to your efforts Kazakhstan stands firmly on its feet, and under your leadership it is developing actively. I hope that we will use the cooperation potential between Russia and Kazakhstan like in previous years, above all in the sphere of the economy, of course. I am pleased to state once again that Russia is Kazakhstan's largest trade and economic partner. Last year our trade grew by more than 34 percent, or US$25.6 billion, I believe. These are very good figures, and, what's most important, we have achieved good momentum. We cooperate actively at international venues, both on the post-Soviet space and at large international organisations. Later this year, in the autumn, we will be marking an anniversary: 30 years of diplomatic relations. We have a whole range of important events planned. I am sure that they will also benefit the development of our business and cultural ties. And here we have much to work on: we have large projects in space exploration, energy, and engineering; the total volume of Russian investment is US$17 billion, I believe, which is quite a sum. So we will continue our work. And, of course, we have a lot to discuss today. I am very happy to see you. Welcome. President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev Tokayev Kassym-JomartPresident of the Republic of Kazakhstan: Thank you, Mr President, first of all, for the invitation to visit Moscow. Indeed, this is my first visit since the New Year. Unfortunately, it is taking place after the tragic events in our country. Indeed, this was a carefully prepared operation involving international terrorists and bandits who attacked Kazakhstan in order to undermine the constitutional system and to stage a coup, first and foremost. An investigation is now underway, and the first results are coming out. Unfortunately, very many people have been killed. I am also devastated by this fact, and I have offered my condolences to the victims' families and friends. Each case is being investigated. Of course, the culprits will be exposed and, most importantly, brought to account. I would like to thank you once again for your warm and business-like response to Kazakhstan's request to deploy a peacekeeping contingent in our country. The peacekeeping contingent played a highly important role in terms of logistic support, so to say, and protecting strategic facilities and, of course, in terms of psychologically intimidating terrorists and bandits who, this time, chose Kazakhstan as their victim. Indeed, we are planning to exchange opinions on a whole range of topical matters at the upcoming talks. These matters concern Kazakhstan's strategic interests and, hopefully, those of both countries. Important agreements will be signed. To be frank, we intend to achieve specific results in our strategic interaction and allied relationship. I believe that we will, naturally, achieve the desired results here, all the more so as the political will is present. We have repeatedly noted that Kazakhstan and Russia are neighbours by the grace of God. We have the longest border in the world, and there simply can be no other relationship between our countries except friendship, cooperation and other interaction. Therefore, we will continue to work in this respect, as you have just said, and I agree with you. <…>"

Our diplomacy helps uphold the lawful rights of Russian citizens and compatriots abroad and facilitates the settlement of regional conflicts and crises and, most importantly, plays a major role in creating favourable external conditions for the steady progress of our country. The situation in the world is becoming more turbulent and tense. This certainly requires additional and persistent efforts to ensure strategic stability and counter arising threats and challenges. This especially includes our bid to receive comprehensive, legally binding national security guarantees from the US and its NATO allies. Naturally, consistent, systemic work to strengthen the supremacy of international law and the UN's central coordinating role, to create a fair and stable multipolar world order remains fully topical. I am convinced that the staff of the Foreign Ministry will continue working efficiently, doing all it can to consolidate Russia's position in the world arena."""

Supreme Court President Vyacheslav Lebedev Lebedev VyacheslavSupreme Court President: Good afternoon, Mr President. Vladimir Putin: I am delighted to see you. Good afternoon, colleagues. I would like to welcome you all to the meeting that you traditionally hold at the start of each year. I suppose that, as always, many ideas and proposals for discussion have accumulated during the previous period. Certainly, their profound and detailed analysis, a search for essential decisions and their adoption are important for the entire judiciary and, of course, for our society and the entire country. This is because there are no minor issues in your work. All aspects of your activity are directly linked with justice and the protection of citizens' rights and freedoms, and they have tremendous public and state significance. This year, we will be marking the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Supreme Court. I know that work is underway to prepare for this significant date, and that the anniversary celebrations will coincide with the X National Congress of Judges, scheduled for November 2022.(Addressing Vyacheslav Lebedev.) Is that correct, Mr Lebedev? Am I right? Vyacheslav Lebedev: That's right. Vladimir Putin: As the top judicial body, the Supreme Court of Russia performs a large volume of work reviewing numerous court cases, analysing and summing up judicial practice, drafting measures to streamline the judicial system. This is a continuous process because life goes on, the country develops, and new tasks arise. Suffice it to say that the rapid development of technology creates entire spheres, subject to legal regulation. New tasks and new complex challenges also arise. For two years now we have been living in the difficult conditions of the spread of the coronavirus infection and the response measures. And, of course, Mr Lebedev, colleagues, in this context I would like to sincerely thank all the judges in Russia for their excellent and sometimes even selfless performance– or better, for fulfilling their mission; and, of course, for working with full dedication, when professional duty comes first and becomes the primary focus. During this difficult time, our courts have not reduced their activities but worked as usual. I would like to emphasise the special role of the Supreme Court and the Council of Judges presidiums, which promptly adopted resolutions on how the courts would work, at the very beginning of the epidemic, and later regularly provided clarification on issues arising due to the pandemic. For example, these concerned medical workers, who provided assistance to patients with COVID-19, exercising their right to receive a special payment, or ensuring the rights of people working remotely– there were very specific questions there– among other acute problems that people had to face during this difficult period. Of course, this is still difficult for many people. And if they go to court they must get a prompt response and a just ruling there. In this context, let me note that Russian justice remained fully socially-oriented last year, which is reflected in the daily routine of the courts as well as in the decisions and rulings of the Supreme Court. There was a special focus on analysing the consideration of cases related to the protection of children's rights, the rights of citizens in the sphere of labour relations, and consumer rights. I would like to elaborate on the activities of magistrates. They have to bear a significant load in all kinds of proceedings. For example, last year they considered over 30 million cases. At the same time, as practice shows, the issues related to ensuring the proper operation of their administrations have not been resolved yet. I know that the Supreme Court has a proposal about this. We are talking about legally formalising interaction between the Russian regional authorities and regional councils of judges when determining the structure and staff lists of magistrates. I believe this proposal deserves support, because similar interaction already takes place when developing draft regional budgets. It focuses the regions' attention on the need to allocate money to support the work of the magistrates. Digitalisation of court activities is yet another important topic. It should be noted that the pandemic has accelerated this process, not only in the courts but everywhere, in all sectors and all spheres of life. Last December, a federal law was adopted envisaging remote participation in court sessions, as well as remote examination of case materials, and sending and receiving documents online. Our judicial system must be completely ready for this broad introduction of advanced technology, both regarding the technical equipment, of course, and, what's important, ensuring the highest level of legal protection for both individuals and legal entities. Colleagues, the agenda of your meeting includes a lot of topical issues. I believe that a constructive discussion will help further improve the effectiveness and quality of justice. I would like to wish you successful and fruitful work. Once again, thank you for what you have done over the last two years, and last year, too. Thank you for your attention. <…> Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, the Supreme Court President presented the country's extensive judicial activities, which, undeniably, represent a crucial tool that ensures the vital activity of the country, the exercise of rights and freedoms of Russian Federation citizens. Of course, this work is under the unfaltering watch of the human rights movement, which monitors certain aspects of activity of the courts in the Russian Federation. In this regard, I would like to say that, first, we are constantly responding to these developments and discussing these issues with the President of the Supreme Court, among other people. At the same time, I would like to point out that, indeed, the judicial system of any country, the Russian Federation in particular, is a formidable machine, a huge mechanism. However, in Russia, it is not a soulless machine, and judging by what the Supreme Court President just reported, the leadership of the Supreme Court, the local judges, and councils of judges remain focused on ways to improve this process. The Supreme Court President outlined a number of proposals to amend current laws in certain areas. Of course, we will team up with the State Duma deputies and the Federation Council members and, along with the judicial community, we will study and put them into practice based on the proposals made by the President of the Supreme Court, the practical work and judicial practice. Mr Lebedev, colleagues, Once again, I would like to thank you for your work and wish you all the best. Thank you."

Many of our fellow Russians– members of the royal family and representatives of different classes of society– donated money for its construction, freely supplied its constantly growing collection with rare exhibits and documents and provided personal collections. Over the past century and a half, the Historical Museum has played a significant role in the study of our Motherland's history, in enhancing national awareness and in teaching people to respect their past. And even in difficult times, at turning points in history, when it was closed to visitors, its employees continued their meticulous work of keeping, systematising and studying its unique collections. It is important that the current personnel worthily continue the traditions of the museum's founders, who bequeathed to""collect sacred national relics from all corners of the Russian land."" Your substantive scientific, educational and methodological activities, your organisation of themed exhibitions in Russian regions and abroad, introduction of modern interactive and multimedia technology as well as your weighty contribution to international humanitarian interaction deserve profound respect. I want to thank you for your great, tireless work, aimed at preserving our priceless historical, cultural and intellectual heritage, and I want to thank you for your conscientious and genuinely selfless labour."""

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67740,Meeting of Council for Science and Education,2022-02-08T18:10:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region","On Russian Science Day, President Vladimir Putin held a meeting of the Presidential Council for Science and Education, via videoconference. The main item on the agenda was the implementation of major innovative projects of national importance.","President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends, good afternoon. Today, our scientists, engineers, research equipment specialists, laboratory staff, and so on, are celebrating their professional holiday. They are wonderful people, devoted to their professions. They expand the horizons of knowledge and create a technological foundation for the advancement of our country. And of course, using this opportunity, I would like to sincerely congratulate you on Russian Science Day, your day, and to emphasise that Russian researchers that are just starting their scientific careers are showing increasingly brilliant and innovative results in the most advanced areas. In this context, I am pleased to introduce the winners of the prize to young scientists, who traditionally take part in the Council for Science and Education sessions. This is a biologist from Vladivostok, Alexandra Dubrovina. She has created a new mechanism for improving the properties of agricultural crops and increasing the harvest. Her method is based on natural biological processes and is safe for the environment and for people, which is vital for developing eco-friendly agriculture. Working in mathematics, physics and biology, researcher from Sevastopol Arseny Kubryakov has created instruments for more precise forecasts of the complicated processes in the world oceans, which have an increasing impact on the planet's climate every year. Leonid Skripnikov created a solid theoretical foundation for developing new materials and a quantum computer. Authoritative research teams are already using the precise calculations from this scientist from St Petersburg in conducting the most sophisticated experiments. I would like to thank our laureates and their research teams– of course, this is always about team work– for their outstanding achievements. I am confident that you and your colleagues from these various fields of knowledge play an active part in implementing our large-scale programmes, which the State Council on Science and Education meeting will focus on today. Today we will consider the most important innovative projects of federal significance, projects that were announced in last year's Address to the Federal Assembly. Implementation will begin in the key areas for the development and security of Russia. I will elaborate on each of them. I would like to start with the most topical and necessary task today: creating firm and reliable defences against new infections. Let me note here that, along with prompt responses, the Government has adopted an entire range of strategic measures to develop new medicines and a system to monitor and prevent biological risks and threats. We need to bring this work to a higher level, to enhance its quality, namely, to establish a strong technological base and infrastructure, so that we can quickly launch the production of effective medicines and vaccines when new and unknown infections and viruses appear. We have discussed this many times with our colleagues from the Government during our regular meetings. To do this, we must have our own domestically made equipment, components, raw materials, as well as advanced and even unique competencies in the development and use of pharmaceuticals, including new generation medicines, such as those used to treat infections that are resistant to antibiotics, to modern antibiotics as well of course. It is also essential to ensure an up-to-date legal environment in order to organise work in this sensitive area, as well as lift barriers and create favourable conditions for the development of new technologies and their safe use. Countering negative changes to the climate is the next essential area in science and technology. Its importance goes without saying, it is well known and widely spoken about in the world. Here, we have set specific goals: over the next three decades, the accumulated volume of net greenhouse gas emissions in Russia should be less than in the European Union, and no later than 2060– this is a consensus arrived at with the Government's input– Russia must achieve carbon neutrality. We will have to adapt the entire Russian economy to the changing climate. We do not need to only rely on someone else's calculations in order to consider the possible risks here and coordinate our actions correctly; we need to determine the balance of carbon in the atmosphere ourselves, objectively and accurately. We have already accumulated significant experience. Roshydromet and our leading research institutes are monitoring climate processes and analysing climate data, and they are considered an authoritative source around the world. However, let me stress that we need a comprehensive, integrated and, of course, reliable mechanism to gather and assess data on Russia's contribution to the concentration of climate-active gases in the atmosphere. In this context, I believe it necessary to establish a scientific system for high-precision monitoring of emission and absorption of substances that have a direct impact on climate change as part of our innovative programmes. Its purpose will be to collect data on carbon emissions, and most importantly, to correctly assess the ability of our forests and other natural ecosystems to absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. It is necessary to set up production of advanced domestic equipment for both land and space measurements in order to launch such a system, as well as form Russian satellite constellations, develop methods and algorithms for high-precision calculations, and build appropriate mathematical models. At the same time, our data must be recognised by the world and used to make global decisions on climate. We have discussed this many times, colleagues, and right now, I am addressing my colleagues in the Government. We can see what is going on in other countries and how the work is organised there in all these areas. And, of course, we must not tolerate unacceptable options and solutions to these vital issues being imposed on us somehow. In order to prevent this from happening, we have to lead in these areas. Let me repeat: we will be reducing the negative impact of Russian industry, transport, and other sectors on the planet's climate based on precise and verified data. At the same time, we have to accelerate and modernise economic growth. Of course, this dual task is not an easy one. Further transition to low-carbon, green energy sources is the most important part of the solution. I have already said many times that it is too early to give up hydrocarbons: they will still be actively used, especially our gas resources, during the next 20–30, and maybe even 50 years. But still, we must understand where all of humanity, the entire planet is heading, and, I repeat once again, be ahead of the curve here. This is especially important, first of all, for the well-being of the environment and the quality of life of Russian citizens, which is a priority for us. Our innovative projects should be aimed at creating just such advanced, safe and environmentally friendly technologies for energy production, transportation, storage and use. And what is fundamentally important: we need solutions for the subsequent reuse or disposal of resources and equipment, including energy storage devices. This is not an easy task: for example, what should we do with used batteries? This problem is becoming more and more acute in practically all countries. I can add that, while ranking fourth in the world in terms of energy production in general, Russia already has one of the""cleanest"" energy systems with a low carbon footprint. We constantly talk about this, and I think that our colleagues in other countries need to be reminded of this. But we definitely need to move ahead, especially since the geographical and natural features of our country, our scientific capacity allow us to successfully develop absolutely any type of environmentally friendly energy. I mean, among other things, controlled thermonuclear fusion and innovative plasma technologies, in which we are absolute leaders in the world, as well as the use of hydrogen in the chemical industry, metallurgy and transport. Then, a significant increase in the efficiency and environmental safety of both traditional and renewable energy sources. We have to talk about all this today. Summing up, I consider it fundamental that all our most important innovative projects undergo meaningful scientific review at all stages of implementation, so that plans and actions are formulated jointly with specialists, scientists, experts and practitioners, of course. As you know, following my instruction, core documents with specific tasks and approaches, with solutions, have been drafted for each of the projects with the participation of the scientific and professional community. Let us discuss these issues today, starting with the climate agenda. <…> Vladimir Putin: I would like to thank all of you for the discussion that we have had and for the proposals that you have formulated. In conclusion, I would like to note that, of course, we all understand that we will have to work hard, and that we have formulated really complicated tasks. This country does not implement such ambitious science and technology projects very often, especially in its modern history. This is not merely a question of developing certain unique solutions. Colleagues from the Government have just said that guidelines have already been formulated in specific spheres. But our task is to set up entirely new directions in this country. Quite possibly, this implies entire sectors. As the Minister has just noted, we need to launch our own production and the most advanced equipment and means of production. This is extremely important in order to boost the level of our technological independence, conduct technological upgrading of existing facilities and build new ones, including new enterprises and laboratories, and in order to launch research projects, including the ones involving our compatriots and world-class foreign scientists and researchers. Today, we have to think about launching programmes to train researchers, engineers and workers for emerging economic sectors. Colleagues have also mentioned the human resources issue separately here. Of course, the results of this work will directly depend on the efficiency and cohesion of specific implementation mechanisms and the actions of those involved in highly important innovative state-level projects. Mr Siluanov has just noted this, and I would like to discuss this matter some time later. Funding is already stipulated for many aspects, and there are also plans to organise the required work. Of course, we need to integrate all this. In this connection, I would like to note that we adopted a number of landmark decisions exactly a year ago. We expanded the powers of the Council for Science and Education and the Government of the Russian Federation as regards R&D management. In a nutshell, these decisions are aimed at facilitating joint coordination, at clearly dividing responsibility between ministries and agencies, research centres, state-owned higher education institutions and private companies, and at organising all this work in line with technological contours, that is, from research and development projects to obtaining specific goods and mass-producing them. And I am asking our colleagues from the Government to draft and approve the highly important state-level innovative projects(that we have just discussed) in line with this strict managerial logic and to pay attention to all proposals of the specialists, scientists and experts that were voiced today. This is the first thing. Second. We have agreed that our innovative programmes will receive support from the state at all stages– from getting fundamental knowledge to making product market-ready. In this regard I ask the Government to devise a clear, efficient and workable financing mechanism agreed by everybody. Mr Siluanov spoke about it in general terms. Of course, it should be borne in mind. However, we should also remember that we need to finance on a priority basis what we already have in the budget for 2022. I want to emphasise this and the Finance Minister has already mentioned it: he spoke about additional sources. They always emerge in the course of our work on the budget. It is clear that everything has been finalised for 2022 but we are distributing additional resources too. In allotting these additional resources please keep in mind that we are discussing one of the priorities today. And, of course, we have to look attentively at the 2023–2024 planning period and make timely amendments or additions. I want to underscore again: we need to give priority attention to the most important innovation projects that have high status– the status of state importance. Without any exaggeration, they should have a serious, big influence on strengthening our security, our sovereignty, on the country's development and on raising the wellbeing and the quality of life of our people. They are to provide for a fundamentally different level of health protection for people, advanced and ecologically safe technology for building housing and managing public transport, a modern economic image and, finally, new spheres of applying the labour and personal fulfilment efforts of our people, including young people, who are becoming increasingly more active in solving environmental and climate problems. Of course, Russia, being a responsible state with a powerful fundamental science capacity, can and should be active in tackling global tasks. I am sure that Russian scientists are capable of making a meaningful contribution to the search for efficient answers to the big challenges facing all countries. In conclusion, colleagues, I want to congratulate you again on Russian Science Day. All employees of our research centres, universities and, of course, members of the Council for Science and Education, I want to wish you success and good health. It happens that the birthday of St Petersburg State University Rector Nikolai Kropachev coincides with Russian Science Day. We all warmly congratulate you and wish you a happy birthday and all the best, Mr Kropachev. Thank you everybody for the joint work today. All the best. Goodbye."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67735,News conference following Russian-French talks,2022-02-08T01:05:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, It is a pleasure to welcome you to the Kremlin and to host the President of the French Republic, Mr Emmanuel Macron in Russia. It appears symbolic that our meeting is taking place on February 7(it looks like it will end on February 8, Moscow time), the day when a fundamental treaty between Russia and France was signed 30 years ago. That vital document provided a reliable foundation for the development of bilateral cooperation based on partnership and mutual respect for decades to come. Our talks with President Macron today were held in a business-like atmosphere and were substantive and meaningful. It is clear to us that Mr President has come to Russia primarily to discuss the current issues of European and global security, for which our countries bear special responsibility as permanent members of the UN Security Council. In addition to this, France is holding the presidency of the Council of the European Union. During the talks, we continued to exchange views on the proposals regarding long-term legally binding security guarantees, which Russia has made to the United States and NATO. I would like to remind everyone that these proposals include three key points: NATO's non-expansion, non-deployment of offensive weapon systems near the Russian border, and the return of the bloc's European capabilities and infrastructure to the 1997 level, when the NATO-Russia Founding Act was signed. Regrettably, the replies from the USA and NATO, which we received on January 26, disregard these concerns of fundamental importance to us. Moreover, our Western partners once again said that all states have a right to freely choose their security arrangements and to enter into any military blocs and alliances. Well, we never questioned this principle. On the other hand, it is also obvious that these blocs and alliances have no obligation to admit any country that wishes to join them. This open-door policy, which we have discussed with many of our partners, including with President Macron today, is very liberal. We believe that only the United States and possibly several other NATO members are benefitting from this interpretation of the fundamental principle of equal and indivisible security, which has been set down in many European documents and includes, as we all know, a pledge not to strengthen one's security at the expense of the security of other states. The reference to the open-door policy, which I have mentioned, is questionable as well. I would like to repeat(I have said this on numerous occasions, including in this very room during a recent news conference following Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orban's visit) that according to Article 10 of the 1949 North Atlantic Treaty, the member states may, by unanimous agreement, invite any other European state in a position to contribute to European security to accede to that treaty. But this does not mean that the bloc is obligated to admit any country, as I have said as well. All right. However, I would like to point out that they continue trying to placate Russia with deliberations that NATO is a peaceful and purely defensive alliance. People in many countries, namely Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan have learned the truth of this statement the hard way, and this is also true about the large-scale military operation against Belgrade waged without a UN Security Council sanction, which is definitely not an operation that could be waged by a peaceful organisation. In addition, we cannot overlook the fact that the 2019 NATO Military Strategy openly describes Russia as the main security threat and an adversary. NATO has designated Russia an adversary. Moreover, while advancing its military infrastructure very close to our border, NATO and its member states believe that they have a right to teach us where and how we can deploy our armed forces. They consider it acceptable to demand that we do not hold planned drills and exercises and present the movement of our troops on our own– I repeat, our own– territory as a threat of a Russian invasion, in this case the invasion of Ukraine. They claim that the Baltic states and our other neighbours feel threatened as well. In any case, this presumption is being used to pursue an unfriendly policy towards Russia. As for the NATO member-countries themselves, they continue to pump Ukraine with modern weapons to this accompaniment, allocating substantial financial resources to modernise the Ukrainian army, and sending military specialists and instructors to Ukraine. Mr President and I have certainly spoken about this. As you can see, it took us a rather long time: the discussion went on for nearly six hours. For our part, we have made a point of drawing Mr President's attention to the reluctance of the current Kiev authorities to meet their commitments under the Minsk Package of Measures and the Normandy format agreements, including those reached at the summits in Paris and Berlin. In my opinion, it is clear to everyone that the current authorities in Kiev have set a course for dismantling the Minsk accords. There are no shifts on such fundamental issues as constitutional reform, amnesty, local elections, and the legal aspects of a special status for Donbass. The well-known Steinmeier Formula– well-known to specialists, at any rate– when we have approved certain amendments to the Minsk accords and made definite concessions, is yet to be included in Ukrainian legislation. But even these items presented by the current President of the Federal Republic of Germany– at that time, he was the German foreign minister– are not being implemented. Kiev is still disregarding all opportunities for a peaceful restoration of the country's territorial integrity via direct dialogue with Donetsk and Lugansk. I have directed Mr President's attention to the widespread and systematic violations of human rights in Ukraine. Dissenting media are closed in the country and political opponents are exposed to reprisals. Incidentally, when Mr Poroshenko was the President of Ukraine, I told him that Russia was ready to grant him political asylum, if he faced problems in the future. He was highly ironic in this regard at the time, but today I would like to reiterate my offer. Despite our serious differences regarding this matter, I mean the settlement in Donbass, as well as the fact that, to my mind, he has made a lot of mistakes in this area, his persecution as a state criminal is also, in my view, an exorbitant'bid for success' on the part of today's leaders. Russia is ready to grant asylum to Mr Poroshenko and persons like him. What worries me most of all is that they are adopting legislation that discriminates against Russian speakers, who have been denied the right to be recognised as a core nation in what is, properly speaking, their homeland, and the right to speak their native language, which is quite odd because this is in no way reflected in the approaches adopted by the European countries. We hope that Mr President intends– at any rate, he said so earlier today– to discuss what we have discussed today as regards European security and stability guarantees at his meeting with the Kiev leaders tomorrow. We also touched upon other topical international and regional matters. While reviewing the situation around Nagorno Karabakh, we noted the positive role of the Russian peacekeepers who are ensuring compliance with the ceasefire regime and helping the region return to peaceful life. We reaffirmed the great significance of efforts by the OSCE Minsk Group's co-chairs in addressing topical humanitarian and socioeconomic matters in the region, among other things. The President of France informed us of the results of his recent videoconference meeting with President of the European Council Charles Michel, the President of Azerbaijan and the Prime Minister of Armenia. We reviewed the situation around the Iranian nuclear programme and efforts to resume the full-fledged implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, adopted in 2015 and approved by UN Security Council Resolution 2231. We agree that it is necessary to continue diplomatic efforts and to assist in the coordination of compromise solutions in the interests of preserving this highly important document. We agreed that our positions are very similar here or, as the diplomats say, they match. Naturally, we did not overlook topical matters of bilateral relations, primarily those regarding economic interaction. Despite the complicated situation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and volatility on the global markets, we underscored and noted that mutual trade grew by 71 percent in 11 months of 2021. French investment in Russia exceeds $23 billion. Over 600 French companies are operating successfully on the Russian market. Overall, we agreed to continue our mutually beneficial cooperation in politics, trade and the economy, as well as in other spheres, including cultural and humanitarian ties. To conclude, I would like to thank Mr President for his efforts and the efforts of France to resolve a highly acute matter linked with our relations with NATO in general, matters linked with maintaining security, creating a situation of stability and mutual trust on the European continent and, of course, resolving the crisis in southeastern Ukraine. We have already met in Paris, and I know that, despite numerous problems facing any state leader, especially the leader of a major European state, Mr President deemed it necessary to come to Russia and to exchange opinions on how we should act in the future. I believe that, although it is still too early to talk about some of his ideas and proposals, it is possible to make them the foundation of our future joint steps. Let us see what Mr President's meeting will achieve in Kiev. We agreed that we will speak on the telephone after his trip to the capital of Ukraine and exchange opinions on this matter. Thank you. President of France Emmanuel Macron Macron EmmanuelPresident of France(retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President. Thank you, Vladimir. Mr President, you have reminded us of Russia's views on the situation regarding the North Atlantic Alliance, Russia's security interests and the Ukrainian issue. You have touched upon the most diverse issues. Indeed, we are now marking the 30th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations, of this bilateral agreement you mentioned. I will not discuss relations between our two countries in greater detail at present because we now realise that the situation is serious, and all of us should find a way, a peaceful path, a path towards stability in Europe. We still have the opportunity and the time to do this. The historical and strategic dialogue that we have developed over the past years can help accomplish this. We have decided to meet in precisely this context in Moscow today. We held very substantial, to-the-point talks. We focused on current areas of tension and on options for de-escalation, to facilitate stability and security on our continent. Mr President, you have reminded us of Russia's views on the situation regarding the North Atlantic Alliance, Russia's security interests and the Ukrainian issue. You have touched upon the most diverse issues. We can see that you have a very strong position, which does not always coincide with the European and Western position. It is necessary to underscore this. We have different views, and we need to understand and accept this. We discussed this in great detail. I believe in Europe and European unity, and this is a fundamental matter. It is true that NATO's open-door policy, which is very important, it is an existential matter, was adopted regarding, say, Sweden and Finland. It would be very difficult to suddenly tell them that NATO plans to change its stand. However, we need to consider the issues you have mentioned, the series of misunderstandings and traumatic events that took place over the past 30 years, and the need to create new security and stability mechanisms in the region. At the same time, I do not think that the creation of these new mechanisms implies a partial revision of the treaties signed over the past 30 years and our fundamental principles, or a restriction of the rights of some European countries that are not parties to the existing treaties. This is an extremely important point. Having said all this, we, nevertheless, tried to find points where our positions coincided, so as to make headway on them in the near future. Firstly, it is necessary to work very quickly to avoid any escalation. Tensions continue to rise today, and this exacerbates the risk of destabilisation. This is not in anyone's interests. Neither Russia, nor the Europeans want chaos and instability now that people on the continent have sustained such heavy economic and social losses from the pandemic and want recovery and tranquillity. This is why we need to come to an agreement on practical stabilisation and de-escalation measures. We have discussed this together. This should be reaffirmed within the next few days or weeks. The result will depend on the talks and consultations with the United States, NATO and the Europeans, as well as on the outcome of my meeting with President Zelensky tomorrow. I would like to note that President Vladimir Putin said he is ready to follow this logic and help maintain the balance in these initiatives, including the issue of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. To sum up, the next few days will be decisive and will obviously require intense discussions that we will continue together. What should be very clear from our conversation is that reliable de-escalation calls for making headway on fundamental matters. We had a lengthy discussion on these matters. We must jointly show the will to work on security guarantees and to build a new security and stability order in Europe. It must be based on the foundation we have created together as sovereign states. This is the principle of continuity of states. I am referring to Russia, France and the other states that are also parties to these treaties. Therefore, this is the fundamental principle of European security. We have approved them by signing the Paris Charter and the subsequent OSCE declarations. I am referring to the principle of the territorial integrity of states, the threat to use or use of force, inviolability of frontiers, and non-interference in internal affairs, as well as violations of international law, human rights and basic freedoms. Whatever the historical interpretations of various crises and incidents may be, to maintain the security of our continent as we have said many times, we must not repeat the past mistakes. We talked for several hours today. But we also talked about this in the past, several years ago. I understand that opinions can differ and that there can be misunderstandings and even traumatic elements. I know that many EU countries did not have the same experience in the 20th century as France did. We must not forget this experience, which has not faded away over the past 30 years. However, we cannot accept the collective risk of another confrontation between spheres of influence in Europe, another period of instability and unrest. This is creating new grievances and new threats. Starting a conflict is easy but ending it and building a lasting peace is difficult. Therefore, I do not believe that we must choose between new rules and the absence of rules. This is optimism based on will, as I see it. Since Russia is committed to the principle of sovereignty and related rights, I am convinced that we will be able to build security and stability in Europe, confirming what we have already achieved within the OSCE framework. That said, we should also come up with new solutions that should probably be more innovative, as regards our ability to ensure specific security guarantees. We raised this issue directly during our conversation, respecting the interests of all our European brothers and ensuring their stability and security, as well as with due regard for the security guarantees proposed by Russia, our neighbour and friend. I have told President Putin that I was concerned about the draft Constitution of Belarus, which is lacking two fundamental principles that were sealed in 1994. I am also concerned about the statement on nuclear weapons made by Alexander Lukashenko in December. I would like to say that President Putin has put my mind at rest regarding this. I am indeed concerned about these matters, because they are increasing destabilisation. We should work together on practical security guarantees for the EU member states and for the regional countries, namely Ukraine, Georgia, Belarus and Russia. This is the goal we must pursue. We had a conversation that allowed us to develop a number of proposals. I must say there is common ground between the positions of France and Russia. You were the ones to start consultations with NATO and the United States, and now we will have to continue detailed talks with all partners in the next few weeks with the express purpose of creating these new peace and security guarantees. Russia has long asked for certain security guarantees, such as restrictions on military deployment and presence of conventional weapons, the transparency of missile defence and on intermediate- and shorter-range missiles. These Russian proposals correspond to the requirements of European states, the EU states. I am sure that a response can only be collective. We are Europeans, but we are also allies of the United States. We have already demonstrated that we can work together, including within the framework of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. Both of us have pointed out that this format can help us make headway on these matters, in particular, on the issues of peace and security, and can help us coordinate common decisions. The third element on which we have managed to find converging positions, which President Putin has mentioned in his statement, as I have said, is the Ukrainian conflict. I am going to Kiev tomorrow to meet with President Zelensky. Of course, we are doing this jointly with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, with whom we coordinated our positions several days ago. I will see him tomorrow afternoon in Berlin. We continue working within the framework of the Normandy format to ensure full compliance with the Minsk agreements and to achieve a complete settlement of the conflict in Donbass. Serious agreements regarding the ceasefire regime were reached during the recent advisers' meeting of the Normandy format countries, and now we must move forward in terms of practical steps to ensure a clear and full implementation of these agreements. We have made progress on several technical issues during the talks. I would like to welcome President Zelensky's efforts, the specific obligations he assumed within this format and as regards all of us. In particular, he promised to withdraw the legislation that did not conform to the Minsk agreements and President Putin mentioned this. This legislation was withdrawn at President Zelesnky's initiative. I have also received detailed explanations from President Putin regarding the rumours about some draft laws also being proposed in Russia. He reassured us that this would not happen if they were not in line with the Minsk agreements. Now that the situation has become clear, we must continue working in this vein. This is important for peace and stability in Europe because this conflict is at the centre of the tension that we are experiencing today. And, of course, Russia and the European Union need to settle this conflict so that we can move forward in our relations. We also mentioned a number of other matters, in particular, the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Here, I have the pleasure to say that eight prisoners were released this morning. The French crisis response centre provided an aircraft to transport them. Last Friday, Prime Minister Pashinyan, President Aliyev and I conducted a videoconference meeting. We discussed missing persons, refugees, borders, and the communications infrastructure, as well as a number of other issues that are required to ensure stability in the future. During the talks with President Putin, we both expressed coinciding views on a number of matters. I would like to welcome the role that members of your military played on the border during the difficult period in Armenia and Azerbaijan. Both France and Russia also play an appropriate role within the scope of the existing Minsk Group agreements. We also mentioned the Iranian crisis, and the recent US and EU initiatives. Our positions on this score are also similar. I would rather not talk about it at length, I just want to emphasise that today, at a time that has serious implications for our countries' collective security and peace, we were able to discuss various aspects and understand the differences in interpretation, the divergence of views, but we also found a similarity of positions. This enables us to move forward. I think we both agree there can be no rational and long-term solution without a political and diplomatic settlement. In the coming days and weeks, there will be opportunities for additional consultations and contacts with all our European partners, with our allies, as well as with Ukraine and other countries in the region. We will have the opportunity in the next few days to once again speak by telephone and discuss Ukraine and our collective security. We would like to build a framework of trust that would allow us to move forward. We are determined to maintain stability and peace and to restart the mechanisms of trust in Europe. This is our collective responsibility. I would like to say that France is reaffirming its commitment to move in this direction. Thank you. Question(retranslated): Good afternoon, President Macron, President Putin. I have a question for both of you. Mr President Macron, you have been making steps towards Russia for five years now but you have had fairly disappointing results. This is evident from the crisis you spoke about and the presence of Russian mercenaries in Mali, which is fuelling anti-French attitudes and even casts doubt on our presence there. Do your actions here make sense? President Putin, a simple question for you: do you intend to invade Ukraine? As for Mali, can you say that your government is not connected in any way with the mercenaries in Mali? Vladimir Putin: First of all, regarding Mali. President Macron raised this issue many times, we discussed it with him, and President Macron is aware of our position on this matter. The Russian government, the Russian state have nothing to do with the companies that are working in Mali. As far as we know, the Malian leadership has no complaints about the commercial activities of these companies. Following the logic that may be applied to NATO, the current member states and potential members, if Mali has opted to work with our companies, it has the right to do so. However, I would like to point out– I will talk about this with President Macron after this news conference– I would like to point out that the Russian state has nothing to do with this. It concerns the commercial interests of our companies, which coordinate their activities with the local authorities. We will take a closer look at this, but we have nothing to do with it. This is the first point. The second, regarding the situation in Ukraine and the issues we have discussed, the issues of concern to us. I spoke about this right here several days ago, during the news conference after talks with the Prime Minister of Hungary. I would like to say this once again. We are categorically opposed to NATO's eastward expansion through the admission of new members because we see this as an overall threat of NATO's continued expansion towards our border. It is not us moving towards NATO but NATO moving towards us. Therefore, saying that Russia is behaving aggressively is at odds with logic. Have we approached anyone's border? No, it is NATO's infrastructure that has come close to us. This is my first point. The second, why is Ukraine's potential admission into NATO dangerous? The problem does exist. For example, European countries, including France, believe that Crimea is part of Ukraine, but we think that it is part of the Russian Federation. And what happens if attempts are made to change this situation by military means? Bear in mind that Ukraine's doctrines declare Russia an adversary and state the possibility of regaining Crimea, even using military force. Just imagine what could happen if Ukraine were a NATO member. Article 5 has not been cancelled. On the contrary, Mr Biden, the President of the United States, has said recently that Article 5 is a sacred obligation and will be honoured. This is fraught with a military confrontation between Russia and NATO. I asked during the above-mentioned news conference,""What are we supposed to do? Fight against the NATO bloc?"" But this question has a second part:""Do you want to fight against Russia?"" Ask your readers, your audiences and the users of online resources,""Do you want France to fight against Russia?"" Because this is how it will be. Our concerns also have to do with common European security. As for Donbass, Ukrainian leaders first say that they will implement the Minsk agreements and then they denounce them and say they will never do this because""this would destroy the Ukrainian state."" I have only just mentioned this. Well, will they, or won't they? This is the question. They speak of security guarantees from us. But who will guarantee our security? The Ukrainian authorities have already made two attempts to settle the problem of Donbass militarily. When they failed again, the Minsk agreements were coordinated and endorsed by a resolution of the UN Security Council. So, will they comply with the agreements or not? Or will they make some other attempt? What should we think? After all, they have tried twice, and who can guarantee that they will not try a third time? These questions require a thorough consideration by all of us. I am deeply grateful to Mr President for discussing these matters in Moscow today. I believe that these security matters concern not only Russia but also Europe and the world as a whole. Look, our proposals include not only NATO's expansion, which we oppose, but also a second point: the non-deployment of offensive systems near our borders. If everyone wants peace, tranquillity, well-being and confidence, what is bad about not deploying offensive weapons near our borders? Can anyone tell me what is bad about this? If NATO is a peaceful organisation, what is bad about returning its infrastructure to the level of 1997, when the NATO-Russia Act was signed? This would create conditions for building up confidence and security. Is this bad? We can let the open-door pledge be, even though the issue remains on the agenda. It is a key priority for us, and I have explained why. We talked about this for six hours. Tomorrow, President Macron will fly to Kiev. We have agreed that he will at least put forth his action plan regarding this. I am deeply grateful to him for giving so much attention to this and that he is trying to find a solution to this matter of great importance to all of us. Emmanuel Macron: To get back to your question, I think that it is first of all France's responsibility to have the strongest possible relationship with Russia. We are two great European nations and great world powers. We are two permanent members of the UN Security Council. Bilateral relations are of great importance for us, firstly, to have them develop, and to have common decisions on acute international issues. We are trying to do so on the Iranian issue and attempting to find a point of contact on Libya and other matters. We do have disagreements but we still find compromise. This is obvious to me. Secondly, I think that President Putin and I agree that Russia is a European country. Those who can see Europe should be able to work with Russia and find ways to build the future in Europe and with Europeans. Is it easy? No, but Europe was also created through difficult initiatives that had immediate effects. So, yes, we do have difficulties but we must not give up. Finally, this is France's mission, it is its role. During these six months we are presiding in the European Union. Our role is to make the voice of the European Union heard and take into account a variety of complex circumstances in communication with such neighbours as Russia, which plays a decisive role in our security, and listen to all Europeans as well. I have been doing this over the past days. Being here I am trying to be the person who can make a contribution to finding this proper way. I have a simple conviction. Do we increase our collective capability for making peace without our contacts with Russia? No, we do not. Who do we leave this role for? For others. We do have disagreements. We realise that. Sometimes we fail to move forward and it is the result of such disagreements. However, we are trying to find compromises. I consider it to be my responsibility. Our task is to make sure that these compromises protect the interests of our partners and allies. This is why in the coming days and weeks we must start this difficult work, find new decisions in order to protect these guarantees while still protecting our basic principles and our neighbourly relations, because our geography will not change. This is why we carry on. Question: I have a question for the President of Russia. Mr President, what is your assessment of the prospects for a settlement in southeastern Ukraine? I mean, roughly speaking, do you think the Minsk agreements are still alive? And a similar question to the President of France. As far as I understand, you have decided to spend the night in Moscow before flying to Kiev tomorrow morning, where you are scheduled to meet with Vladimir Zelensky. What message are you conveying to Kiev, given Ukraine's recent statement about the Minsk agreements' potential to destroy Ukrainian statehood if implemented, and France, as we know, is the guarantor of the Minsk agreements? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Concerning the Minsk agreements, if they are still alive and if they have any prospects at all, I believe there is simply no alternative. I repeat once again, one day Kiev says that they will comply, and the next day they say the agreements will destroy their country. The incumbent President recently stated that he does not like a single point of the Minsk agreements. Well, like it or lump it, you have to fulfil them. It will not work otherwise. They do not want to talk with representatives of Donbass directly, when clauses 12, 9 and 11 directly list the matters that should be""discussed and agreed upon with representatives of these territories."" Discussed and coordinated with them. How else can this be done? No other way. So just pluck up the courage, acknowledge what is written, stop saying that black is white and white is black and get to work. After all, the current government's campaign promise was to resolve the Donbass crisis peacefully. I really do hope that this will eventually be done, when the realisation comes that it is impossible to do otherwise. Poroshenko is also being slammed now for signing those agreements, even accused of treason. Yes, he signed the agreements, so what? The country accepted it. This was confirmed by a resolution of the Security Council. I was not joking when I told him, you know, there will come a time when we will be granting you political asylum for humanitarian reasons. Not because we really like or liked his policy, but for humanitarian reasons. I knew it would be like this, as if I had second sight, and this is what happened. He is under investigation there now. But all these things have to do with internal politics. I urge you to take the high road and think about the historical and strategic prospects for Ukraine's development, its interaction with Russia, and think about creating stable security conditions for everyone, equal for all participants in international affairs. Emmanuel Macron: To reply to you I will say a few things. First, today President Zelensky is the President of a country on the border of which there are 125,000 Russian military. So, yes, he is nervous. And this only became news in the past few months. This was not the case in early 2021. So, regardless of everything, since you quoted his recent words, I want to say that I still think Mr Zelensky is displaying self-control in the context of international comments and this should be welcomed. Second, when the Minsk agreements were signed, Russia's military presence on the border was not as intensive and this is a major change in the situation. This is why this is a very important aspect of our discussion with Mr Putin. We are talking about this when we mention de-escalation. I am referring to the Russian and Belarusian borders. Obviously, there can only be a political solution to the Ukrainian issue and the Minsk agreements are the only foundation for it. The Normandy format is the right format. Let me repeat that Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany sit at the table in this format. These agreements provide for initiatives and progress. They should move forward in the next few days and weeks. Our advisors met in Paris recently in this context. A joint communique was issued for the first time in several months. Now, the process is back on track. Some very sensitive issues on constitutional reform, on elections are now under discussion and will be developed in the near future. I told Mr Zelensky and Mr Putin that the Minsk agreements alone can really achieve progress and settle the crisis in Ukraine. I will discuss this with President Zelensky tomorrow. Question(retranslated): Good afternoon, Messrs Presidents. Mr Macron, you have come to Moscow and are you speaking on behalf of France or on behalf of Europe? Mr Scholz is now in Washington. Would it not make sense to come to Russia together, as Hollande and Merkel did in 2015, to show European unity? President Putin, is Mr Macron your only dialogue partner in Europe? You said he was a good conversationalist. Do you consider him as an intermediary to convey your message to the Europeans? Mr Macron, could you also answer the question about PMC Wagner's presence and whether Russia is involved in that in any way? Vladimir Putin: I have already covered this issue. I have already made it clear that the Russian state has nothing to do with this. I am saying this quite responsibly without any hidden agenda. Local authorities invite them at the state level, thank them for their work, and so on. With regard to the first part of the question, I want reiterate, I have said this before, but I would really like you to hear me this time and convey this message to your readers, viewers and internet users. Do you realise that if Ukraine joins NATO and decides to take Crimea back through military means, the European countries will automatically get drawn into a military conflict with Russia? Of course, NATO's united potential and that of Russia are incomparable. We understand that, but we also understand that Russia is one of the world's leading nuclear powers, and is superior to many of those countries in terms of the number of modern nuclear force components. But there will be no winners, and you will find yourself drawn into this conflict against your will. You will be fulfilling Paragraph 5 of the Treaty of Rome in a heartbeat, even before you know it. Of course, the President does not want to see developments unfold in this way. I do not want it, either. That is why he is here and has been tormenting me for six hours now with his questions, guarantees, and solutions. I believe his is a lofty mission, and I am grateful to him for his efforts. For our part, we will do our best to find compromises that suit everyone. There is not a single point that we consider unachievable in the proposals we sent to NATO and Washington. There is also the ongoing issue related to the situation in Donbass. The President said that Russia is conducting exercises and has amassed a large group of forces. But has Ukraine not amassed them also? They have the same 100,000 or 125,000 troops concentrated in Donbass. To reiterate, they have tried to resolve the Donbass issue through military means twice, and they did not conceal this as they used equipment and aviation. Who will give us guarantees that this will not happen? This is also a legitimate question on our part. This is a complex entanglement, which is why the talks took so many hours. I hope that tomorrow the President– yes, I do understand that there are no easy questions there, he will have a hard time in Kiev,– but we agreed that after consultations with the leadership of Ukraine, we will have a telephone conversation and get some feedback about what the current Ukrainian leadership believes is acceptable or not acceptable, and how it plans to move forward. Depending on this, we will work on our own path forward. Emmanuel Macron: First, I would like to put your mind at ease. We have very good coordination with Chancellor Scholz. I was in Berlin two weeks ago, and have exchanged views with him several times since then. We will talk as soon as we return– he from Washington and I from Moscow. As the President of the EU Council for a six-month period, I exchange views with all my colleagues, those whom this situation primarily concerns and who are particularly concerned about it. There have been many consultations in the past few days, including two with Britain and two with the USA. The consultations were very intensive. The Chancellor will also come next week. What I am doing now is very different from the situations in 2008 and 2014. Not a""real war,"" as was the case in Georgia and Ukraine, but very serious tensions that have happened very rarely in the past few decades. As you understand, this is largely an issue between Russia and NATO. This matter concerns our collective security. We are launching this process but it is very different from the situations you are talking about. Therefore, we will extend these consultations and, based on today's discussion, will move forward, and try to launch a new mechanism. This is because the situation is new and the response is very different. As for the Wagner group, the President's reply is very clear. France only recognises states and the fight against terrorism. Therefore, we make decisions on counterterrorism struggle as regards sovereign states and in close coordination with the region. In this case, we are consulting ECOWAS and the African Union. Question: If I may, I would like to return to the topic of security guarantees. You mentioned it, but the general impression is that after NATO and Washington replied to Russia's proposals, the subject has gone quiet. As they say in Russia, it has been played for too long and has become stale. In this context, I would like to ask you Mr Macron, do you think the issue of giving Russia guarantees is closed for the Europeans? What ways of resolving this problem do you see? Mr Putin, I would also ask you to clarify something. Russia has received a response. What will you do next? I would also like to return to your words– you cited one of the arguments quoted by our partners regarding the alliance, its peaceful nature. I would also recall another argument– that NATO is a political rather than a military organisation. And one more argument– that decisions in NATO are made by consensus. So, if a number of alliance members are against Ukraine's entry, it is not going to happen. What do you think about these arguments? What are your apprehensions in this situation then? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: With regard to the military or non-military nature of the organisation, I think I have already covered that. The bombing of Belgrade, Iraq, Syria, the early phases of the operation in Afghanistan, and so on… Is that not military? In fact, it is as military as it gets. Regarding the fact that a number of NATO countries are against Ukraine or Georgia joining the alliance, we are aware of that, and we have heard this many times. I have a question in this regard: if this is the case, why did these countries sign a document in Bucharest in 2008, under which they open the doors to NATO for these countries? You know, we have tried to talk to them about avoiding certain actions for 30 years now. What we get in response is total disregard for our concerns, demands and proposals. Yes, the President said during our conversation– I hope Emmanuel will not be angry with me for saying this– he basically said,""You yourself violated territorial integrity. You have assumed a number of obligations since 1975, including the Helsinki Act and so on, and the most recent document was adopted in Astana in 2010. It covers equal security for all. You cannot create a secure environment by violating the security of others. You yourself have violated territorial integrity. This is a pressing issue for Ukraine."" Not quite so, or not so at all. Have we carried out any operations in Crimea or anywhere else against a regular country or a regular government? No. We have never done that. We did not even think about doing it. Why did the Western countries support the coup? From that moment on, for us, the coup, not the people's will, is the source of power in Ukraine. Indeed, there have been iterations, including elections and re-elections, but originally the power was seized by force and blood was shed. Given the circumstances, we were forced to protect the residents of Crimea. Could we do anything else? Why put us in these circumstances? After all, representatives of several European countries were there in 2014, put their signatures under the document and issued guarantees for the peaceful course of the political process. Three days later, power was seized forcefully. They do not comply with anything, while expecting us to comply with everything? Let us not play this game, it is a bad sandbox. We do not like this game. I agree though, now we have what we have. We must look for a way out of this situation. This is what President Macron and I have been discussing for several hours. We plan to continue working towards this end. With regard to what we will do next. We will now prepare a response to the document that we received from Brussels and Washington(I informed the President about this in general terms), and send it to Washington and Brussels. There are things that we can discuss. True, they are of a secondary nature, but nevertheless. However, we will be seeking answers to key questions. For some reason, our partners asked us not to publish their response to us. Let us face it, this sounds strange, does it not? If we sent our questions openly, why hide their response from the public in our respective countries? I am not going to discuss every item, but none of the key issues, such as the non-expansion of NATO, the non-deployment of assault systems near our borders, the rollback of NATO infrastructure to where it was in 1997, were answered even with a simple yes or no. The impression is that we did not even raise these questions. They simply let them go unnoticed. What we see there are political clichés and proposals concerning minor issues. I do not think our dialogue will end with that. We are going to draft an answer, our vision, and send it to Washington and Brussels. President Macron was duly informed about where we stand. Emmanuel Macron: The President's opening remarks and his answer illustrate the existing differences, misunderstandings, and the different views that NATO and Russia have had on this issue in the past few decades. This is a fact. Because the Paris Charter that we are discussing also states clearly, in black and white the need to respect sovereignty, territorial integrity and human rights. These principles were also violated, and not by NATO. Therefore, it is obvious that neither NATO nor the USA can accept all of Russia's demands in the context of the very significant military pressure on the border with Ukraine, as I have already said. This is further aggravated by the daily appearance of news about the start of hostilities. I heard the President's words and I see his willingness to move forward and find a political solution, but the tensions are very high. Therefore, searching for common ground and a political solution does not mean that we have to agree on everything. It simply means that the process has gotten underway. Is exchanging letters sufficient to find a solution in such a complicated process? I think we have exhausted its potential. Is it possible to resolve everything by settling the issue with NATO? No, I do not believe that, either. This is a very important issue but there are also other issues that we must resolve to guarantee our collective security. We spoke about this today. I am convinced– and this is why I am here– that we must work together so that Russia, the United States, Europeans and their allies can, first of all, leave behind the misunderstandings of the past as much as possible because they do exist, deal with our traumas because they strongly influence our views on the path Europe has taken in the past 30 years and lead to diametrically opposed conclusions, and, most importantly, find useful solutions. To me, it is abundantly clear what that means– military stability in the short term. Not a single provocation or escalation must be allowed. This is why I came here, to Moscow, and will arrive in Kiev tomorrow. It is necessary to continue dialogue on this basis with all sides– NATO, the USA, and the EU– with a view to finding a short- and mid-term solution. What is the goal? The security of all, because there is no security for Europeans if there is no security for Russia. This is what I heard when talking to my colleagues in Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland and other countries. They have the same apprehensions. They also feel the same treaties were violated. These treaties did not envisage troop deployment, but it happened. This is why processes based on transparency and de-escalation are needed. We should do this together because we live on both sides of our shared borders. We must devote the next few weeks to these issues. In seeking security, we must also respect the sovereignty and independence of states that are not EU or NATO members but that are located in the region. This applies to Belarus, Ukraine, of course, Georgia and Moldova– the countries whose sovereignty and independence must be respected because that is also part of our collective security. We must also take this into account. As for Ukraine, yes, we know what the framework for resolving security issues is– the Minsk agreements and the Normandy format. That said, it is also necessary to discuss openly other issues as well. Stability and creating conditions for de-escalation will involve the development of new mechanisms based on our values and on what we agreed to over the past 30 years. However, at the same time, looking at our current differences and the existing situation, we must also find new joint solutions for maintaining stability and security. President Putin and I reviewed several options. I will work on them, and I know he will also work on them in his replies to NATO and the United States. We will continue and intensify this dialogue. We will talk again in a few days. We will draft new initiatives together with all participants and parties involved. I am sure we will achieve results. It will be difficult, but I am convinced it will work."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67734,Talks with President of France Emmanuel Macron,2022-02-07T23:40:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin held talks with President of the French Republic Emmanuel Macron at the Kremlin.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, Emmanuel, It is a pleasure to see you. Last time we met was two years ago and, of course, there is a backlog of issues that we can and should discuss in a direct format. Still, over these years, our contacts have never been interrupted, and we remain in touch at all times. Moreover, despite the pandemic, bilateral trade is up. During the pandemic, it fell by 15 percent, but over 11 months of 2021 it grew by over 70 percent to reach pre-pandemic levels and, I think, even slightly exceeded them. Our colleagues are working quite successfully in the political sphere, including the foreign ministries and a 2+2 meeting between our respective defence ministers and foreign ministers. Relations in the humanitarian sphere are on the rise as well. We have held events that cover region-to-region cooperation. More than 150 events have been held, and this helps create a supportive environment for promoting relations between our two countries. Here is what I would like to point out specifically: of course, I understand that we share concerns about security developments in Europe, and I want to thank you for the fact that France invariably and strongly participates in the development of fundamental decisions in this area. This has been the case with our relations in recent years. It is symbolic that we are meeting today because a fundamental document, the agreement on special relations between Russia and France, was signed 30 years ago today. Notably, throughout these years, as I have mentioned, France has taken a very active part in addressing fundamental European security issues. Your predecessors did the same. France engaged in addressing the crisis that broke out after Georgia attacked South Ossetia, and in developing the Minsk agreements, and then organising the Normandy format. I appreciate the amount of effort invested by the current leadership of France and personally the President of France in resolving the crisis around the need to ensure equal security in Europe for an extended historical perspective, and in overcoming the challenges that are related to resolving the domestic crisis in southeastern Ukraine. We discussed these matters over the telephone in great depth. I am aware that you have your own thoughts on this matter, and I am pleased to have the opportunity to meet with you in person to discuss these things. Welcome, Emmanuel. President of France Emmanuel Macron Macron EmmanuelPresident of France(retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President, thank you very much, Vladimir. Indeed, today is the 30th anniversary of resuming diplomatic relations, and I would like to reiterate that bilateral relations have made it possible to focus on many issues. We have many hopes in the cultural, academic and scientific spheres. We hope to continue the Trianon Dialogue together and advance the economic agenda. The critical situation in Europe is our shared concern, and our continent– you pointed this out– is in a critical situation, so we all need to act with great responsibility. Together we laid the foundation for an open, straight, and full-fledged dialogue in 2019. Since then, there have been several exchanges of views in St Petersburg, Bregançon and other venues, and I believe this dialogue remains as relevant as ever. We need this dialogue, because it is the only thing that, I think, can ensure genuine stability and security for the European continent. In this context, we have had several telephone conversations in recent weeks, as you mentioned. Despite the crisis, I had a chance to exchange views with President Zelensky about Ukraine, as well as to coordinate views with many Europeans and Allies, including the British, Americans and Canadians. I think today's conversation can pave the way to de-escalation, which is where we should be heading. We are aware of the military-political situation and the Ukraine issue. You noted its importance, including the Normandy format, security issues in Belarus and the entire region, as well as important collective security issues, which we will cover later. I am glad we have this opportunity to discuss these issues in depth, so that we can collectively begin to develop a practical response for Russia and the whole of Europe. A useful and practical response would be one that helps avoid war and build stability, transparency and trust for all. Thank you very much for your warm welcome and for your time. <…>"

We are confident that this personal meeting will add more energy and vigour to relations between our countries. The coronavirus pandemic is spreading around the world extremely quickly. The world has entered a new phase of shocks and changes. Humankind is facing numerous challenges and crises. In this situation, our countries remain committed to their initial goal, working tirelessly to ensure the sustainable development of our relations and to protect their fundamental interests. Our political and strategic trust is growing stronger. Our mutual trade exceeded US$140 billion last year, thereby reaching a new historic high. Our countries are actively contributing to the reform of the global governance system. We are working together to promote a truly multilateral world order. Efforts to uphold the real democratic spirit are a reliable foundation for rallying the world towards overcoming crises and protecting equality. We will keep moving towards this, and we will continue working together with you to map out plans for the further development of Chinese-Russian relations in a new historical period, trying to transform mutual trust between our countries into practical cooperation to the benefit of our peoples. Thank you. President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, my dear friend, First of all, I would like to thank you for inviting me to the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. We know from our own experience that it takes hard work. I am sure that our Chinese friends have organised everything brilliantly, just as always when it comes to major events. Attending the Olympics opening ceremonies has become a tradition. We attended the opening ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics held in China, and you attended the opening ceremony of the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi. Just as agreed, we have now come to Beijing for the opening of the Winter Olympic Games. I am confident that our athletes, both Chinese and Russian athletes, will perform befittingly. The whole world will be watching the sports developments. Regarding our bilateral relations, they are, indeed, developing steadily in the spirit of friendship and strategic partnership. They have acquired a truly unprecedented nature and are an example of worthy relations that help both parties to develop and, at the same time, support each other in their development. As you have already noted, our bilateral trade has reached US$140 billion. We are moving steadily towards our goal, namely, reaching US$200 billion in mutual trade. I am confident that we will certainly attain this level. Unfortunately, it has been impossible to hold offline meetings over the past two years. Nevertheless, you and I have always been in touch, we have attended videoconferences and spoken with each other by telephone. But, most importantly, we supported the efforts of our teams in virtually all spheres. I am talking about foreign ministries and joint work at international venues. This concerns the most diverse economic aspects, including high-tech and the""green"" agenda during the conversion to new power sources. Nor do we forget about traditional areas. In the run-up to our current meeting, our oil workers have drafted good new solutions regarding hydrocarbon deliveries to the People's Republic of China. We have made another step forwards in the gas sector. I am referring to the new contract to deliver ten billion cubic metres of gas from Russia's Far East to China every year. I repeat, we are making headway in high-tech fields. The agenda is quite packed. Of course, we are taking advantage of the Russian delegation's current visit. Despite the pandemic-related restrictions, the Russian delegation looks quite large. We will work actively on all aspects. Although we know from our own experience how busy you and your colleagues will be during the Olympic Games opening ceremony, I hope that we will find a few minutes to discuss our bilateral relations. Thank you very much. <…>"

It would be no exaggeration to say that the lives of millions of people worldwide depend on the effectiveness of this work.

The agenda included items such as stimulating private investment, reducing the administrative burden and excessive oversight, developing infrastructure, and improving legal regulations.*** President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues. I am happy to have this meeting with Delovaya Rossiya, one of the country's leading business associations. First of all, I would like to congratulate you, your entire organisation, on a remarkable date: Delovaya Rossiya turned 20 in December. It happened following our meeting in 2001, and on December 10, 2001, it was registered with the Ministry of Justice. Over these years, your association, your movement, one might say, has united rapidly expanding non-commodity mid-sized businesses across almost all industries and sectors of our economy. Branches have been opened in every constituent entity of the Russian Federation, and colleagues from the regions are also here with us today, you can see them on the screen, they are participating in our meeting. Such broad representation and deep understanding of entrepreneurs' problems makes it possible for Delovaya Rossiya to discuss items on the economic, legislative and business agenda in the most concrete way and to conduct a constructive dialogue with government bodies of all levels as partners. I believe this feedback is extremely important and, moreover, necessary for our joint effective work, for developing strategic decisions on growing the Russian economy and improving the investment climate, and for preparing operational measures to support businesses. For example, such measures were adopted two years ago with the involvement of Delovaya Rossiya and other associations, and recently, too, at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic and as we fought to control it during all these events. I know that Delovaya Rossiya focuses on improving the business environment and launching new entrepreneurial initiatives to create new modern jobs and industries. We constantly discuss this during personal meetings. This includes improving regulations, supporting investment, expanding infrastructure, digitisation, and so on. We have many items on the agenda. I am sure you have specific proposals regarding these issues based on practical experience, as it has always been. In fact, this is the purpose of ongoing cooperation at all levels between government and business representatives who work in various associations. I hope effective decisions that matter to all Russian entrepreneurs will be made as a result of our meeting today as well. Today, we have online not only members of your movement, or association, but my colleagues from the Government as well. You can see them on the screen. We are at your disposal. I will also take questions, if any, and state my position. As a rule, very specific questions are asked at meetings like this one, very technical, I would say, so I may ask my colleagues from the Government for help. You can see them here on the screen. Please, let us get to work. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67706,Press statements following Russian-Argentine talks,2022-02-03T17:10:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues, It is a pleasure to receive President Fernandez of the Argentine Republic in the Kremlin. This is his first visit to Russia. During our businesslike and constructive talks, the President and I reviewed in detail the full range of bilateral relations. We discussed in practical terms potential areas for further developing the comprehensive strategic partnership of our countries. We also exchanged views on some current international and regional issues. I would like to note that Argentina is one of Russia's key partners in Latin America. For over 150 years, our countries have been united by kind, friendly relations that are based on equality, respect, and regard for each other's interests. We are doing all we can to promote our close, mutually beneficial cooperation and look for new areas of interaction. As today's meeting showed, the President shares this approach. I would like to emphasise that Russia and Argentina maintain productive cooperation in combatting the spread of the coronavirus. Argentina was the first country in the Western Hemisphere to register the Russian Sputnik V vaccine. Russia has supplied Argentina with almost 15 million vaccine doses. In addition, an Argentine pharmaceutical company has produced over six million doses in Buenos Aires province where local production of the Russian vaccine is based. We are pleased to note that despite the difficult situation caused by the pandemic, Russia and Argentina are developing economic ties. Bilateral trade increased by 50 percent during the past year. There are good opportunities for stepping up bilateral investment cooperation. Russian and Argentine businesses are interested in working with each other. Last December, a big Russian business mission visited Argentina. They held talks with a broad range of Argentine partners and the President personally welcomed our entrepreneurs in Buenos Aires, for which we are grateful to him. The relevant intergovernmental commission has to step up its efforts to promote and diversify bilateral economic cooperation. The Russian-Argentine and Argentine-Russian business councils also have a big role to play in developing business ties. These two councils discussed promising ideas for cooperation at their regular videoconference the other day. I would like to mention the participation of the Russian company Transmashholding in upgrading railways in Argentina as an example of successful bilateral cooperation. Recently, this Russian company won a big tender for the supply of electric trains. Importantly, local production in Argentina will amount to up to 25 percent of the total. In addition, Russian companies are ready to join the implementation of other projects in railway infrastructure, such as supplies of rolling stock and other equipment. In turn, Rosatom is willing to offer Argentina assistance in further developing its power industry. There exist good opportunities for promoting cooperation in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes. They were created when the relevant intergovernmental protocol entered in force in December 2020. We see considerable potential for expanding cooperation in geological prospecting, construction and maintenance of energy and oil-and-gas infrastructure, renewable energy, the chemical industry and machine building, to name a few. We are enhancing interbank cooperation. In 2020, the central banks of Russia and Argentina signed a memorandum on cooperation. Commercial banks are upgrading their contacts. Bilateral cultural and humanitarian ties are making good progress. The Cinema Online project was launched virtually by the Russian House[Russian Science and Culture Centre] in Buenos Aires in 2021. It hosts weekly screenings of the best Soviet and Russian films. The Russia Today media holding is successfully operating in Argentina. And, of course, I would like to say special thanks to the President for his support of Moscow's bid for the EXPO-2030 World Fair. The exchange of views on global and regional problems showed that Russia and Argentina hold similar or identical positions on many issues. Our countries firmly uphold the principles of the supremacy of international law, sovereignty, independence, and non-interference in the domestic affairs of foreign states. We agreed to continue coordinating our efforts on key multilateral issues at international venues, including the UN. We are ready to step up efforts to expand ties between integration associations, above all, the Eurasian Economic Union and the Southern Common Market(MERCOSUR), and to cooperate more closely within the G20. In closing, I would like to thank Mr Fernandez for the focused, candid and substantive dialogue. I am convinced that today's exchange of views and talks will serve to further strengthen the comprehensive strategic partnership between our countries. Both Mr Fernandez and I will participate in the opening ceremony for the 24th Olympic Winter Games in Beijing tomorrow. I would like to wish good luck and success to Russian and Argentine athletes. Thank you. President of the Argentine Republic Alberto Fernandez Fernandez AlbertoPresident of Argentina(retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President. It was a great honour for me to meet with you today. We had a very candid and open conversation on matters that our countries are addressing as part of the bilateral agenda. Both countries support the logic of multilateral cooperation and a multipolar world. Argentina owes a debt of gratitude to the Russian Federation, because Russia was the first country to make sure that Argentina received the coronavirus vaccine. This help made it possible for us to be the first to gain access to the Russian Sputnik vaccine, which helped us mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our people. Based on this, we can expand our technology cooperation. Together, we can launch the production of not only vaccines, but other products as well. This could involve Russian investment in Argentina. We can ensure the exchange of technology, or the transfer of technology, so that Argentina can continue to industrialise its economy. We spoke about things that President Putin addressed in depth. This, of course, concerns cooperation in railway infrastructure, trains, cooperation in the energy sector, gas production, and innovative technologies in the energy sector, such as solar and wind energy. We spoke about the opportunities offered by Argentina and exchanged views on the circumstances in which the world and our region are now living. I asked President Putin to make full use of the comprehensive strategic partnership agreement that Argentina signed with Russia in 2015 and to deepen our cooperation so that it becomes an effective reality and Argentina and Russia can gradually expand ties. I am leaving Moscow very happy today. I am grateful to President Putin for the hospitality. I wish I could stay several days more and continue this wonderful visit, but tomorrow I will see the President of Russia at the Winter Olympic Games. Thank you again. I am absolutely sure that we are taking a very important step forward in deepening the fraternal ties between Argentina and Russia for the benefit of both countries. Thank you."

We have been planning this in-person meeting for a long time. Unfortunately, it was not possible for it to go ahead because of the epidemiological situation. To the best of my knowledge, we met in January 2020 at events in Israel commemorating the victims of the Holocaust. Nevertheless, contacts have continued unabated all this time. Of course, we are grateful to you because Argentina was the first country in the Western Hemisphere to register the Sputnik V vaccine. The first contract has now been virtually fulfilled: almost 15 million of the 20 million doses have been delivered to Argentina. This vaccine is already being manufactured at factories in Argentina, and over six million doses have already been produced. The registration of the Sputnik M vaccine for young people aged 12–17 is now being discussed. And I would like to congratulate you on such a large-scale vaccination effort. Almost 78 percent of your population have been inoculated, and this is a very good outcome. Of course, we still have a lot to accomplish in order to advance our trade and economic cooperation, which increased by 50 percent in 2021. This is a very serious, impressive result, and the pace is satisfactory. We have many positive areas of cooperation, our colleagues are working at healthcare ministries, foreign ministries, and other agencies, too. Your brief stay in Russia is also linked with this situation. But I hope that we will be able to continue these personal contacts in Argentina and here in Russia. We are going to Beijing together, for the opening ceremony of the Olympic Winter Games. But, as I see it, we will find it more convenient to talk here, in a calm and relaxed atmosphere, and to discuss all our bilateral issues and the situation on the international scene, too. I am happy to see you. Welcome to Russia. President of the Argentine Republic Alberto Fernandez(retranslated): Mr President, First, this is a great honour for me, thank you for the invitation, I was eager to see you. It is a great pleasure for me to meet with you in Moscow where we can talk in a calm atmosphere and discuss how we should promote cooperation between Argentina and Russia in all areas. People in Argentina appreciate Russia a lot, and notably, your assistance with the vaccines that you sent us. This was very important to us in countering the pandemic. Indeed, you provided us with significant support at that time and we are very grateful to you because we did not have enough vaccines then. Thanks to you, we did a good job and the results of our efforts were excellent. I had two doses myself and then I waited a bit before getting a third dose of Sputnik. Vladimir Putin: Me too. Alberto Fernandez: Indeed, we are deeply grateful for this assistance because the rest of the world did not help us with vaccines. This is very important and highly valued. I think we can deepen and expand this substantial groundwork because there are many areas in which we can cooperate very well. I believe that Argentina could become Russia's gateway to Latin America to a certain extent. We could be a venue for the development of your cooperation with Latin American nations. The vaccine example is indicative because we became a stepping stone in the supply of the Russian vaccine to Ecuador, Peru and Paraguay, and this is very important. I think this is a great opportunity for developing our cooperation, and Argentine society is willing to do this, relying, of course, on your support. Argentina is now facing a difficult situation because we have serious external debt and challenging economic issues. Since the 1990s, Argentina has been strongly oriented towards the United States. Argentina and its economy are largely dependent on the US and our relations with it. In fact, our debt to the IMF also emerged because of this relationship. At first, when our party was in power from 2003 to 2015, we tried hard to get rid of this dependence on the US. We achieved a lot towards this end. You will remember, at that time we signed a strategic agreement with Russia, thereby upgrading our bilateral ties. A different party came to power in Argentina in 2015. It resumed these relations with the US, and this largely explains our external debt. I am consistently working to rid Argentina of this dependence on the IMF and the US. I want Argentina to open up new opportunities. Cooperation with Russia is vital for us. I would like to assure you, and I hope that you will accept my assurances that we do want to develop cooperation with Russia. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67695,Interview with China Media Group,2022-02-03T02:05:00Z,NA,"Ahead of his visit to People's Republic of China, the President of Russia answered questions from China Media Group President and Editor-in-Chief Shen Haixiong.","President of China Media Group Shen Haixiong(retranslated): Mr. President, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to interview you again. First, let me welcome you to the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. In February 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the opening ceremony of the 22nd Winter Olympics in Sochi at your invitation. This was the first time a Chinese leader had attended a major international sporting event abroad. Then, Xi Jinping said:""If our neighbors have a joyous occasion, we certainly should go there to congratulate them."" Today is a joyous occasion for China– we are hosting the Winter Olympics for the first time; all the more so as it comes in the midst of the Spring Festival(the Chinese Lunar New Year). When applying to host the Winter Olympics, China announced a plan to engage 300 million people in winter sports. Now, ski resorts are being built even in my home province of Zhejiang in southern China. You were the first foreign leader to confirm your arrival at the opening ceremony. What special role does sport play in relations between the two neighbors China and Russia? How can our countries strengthen cooperation in ice and snow culture, winter sports and related industries? What results do you expect from Russian athletes at the Olympics? Can you predict how many gold medals they will win? Vladimir Putin: President Xi Jinping and I have known each other for a long time, as good friends and politicians who hold largely the same views on addressing the world's problems; we maintain close and frequent contact. That is why, I immediately responded to his invitation to visit China and to join our Chinese friends in celebrating this year's main sporting event– the Winter Olympic Games. Moreover, the first ever Winter Olympics on Chinese soil will take place in the midst of the Chinese New Year, in Beijing– the first city in the world to host both the Summer and Winter Games. I know that the organizers have done a good job preparing for the Games. They made massive investments in sports and transport infrastructure, built modern sports venues. They created an environment for the safe stay of foreign athletes, coaches and journalists. I am sure that such excellent preparations for the Olympics will help the Olympic athletes to show their sporting character and demonstrate their skills and ability to achieve their goals in a fair and uncompromising competition. Naturally, we will be supporting our athletes, we will celebrate their every victory and every achievement. But only the competition will show how many and what medals they will win. Besides, the epidemiological situation may have an impact on athletes' participation and, consequently, on the final results. Sport is a unique phenomenon of human civilization. Major sports festivals are designed to bring nations together, deepen mutual understanding and promote the universally accepted principle of""fair play"", as was vividly illustrated by the success of the large-scale sporting events such as the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and the 2018 FIFA World Cup, hosted by our country. Russia has been and remains committed to the traditional Olympic values. We oppose the attempts to politicize sport or use it as a tool of coercion, unfair competition and discrimination. We reject the practice of""collective punishment"" for acts perpetrated by individual people, which has recently become a frequent occurrence. And of course, we strongly condemn the use of prohibited substances by athletes and advocate broad international cooperation in the fight against doping in sport. Our country has a well-developed infrastructure, sports schools known for their champions and traditions, and a rich history of sporting records; it organizes major international competitions, encouraging our citizens, especially our youth, to engage in physical culture and sports. This is what helps to preserve the health of the people and the nation as a whole and shape a strong foundation for future sporting achievements. We expect that by 2024 the share of people regularly engaging in sports will be 55 percent and by 2030 it will reach 70 percent. As for the interaction between Russia and China in sports and physical education, it occupies an important place in our bilateral humanitarian cooperation and is broad and complex in nature. A number of events, including those in winter sports, have become truly important. Among them are the Russian-Chinese Winter Youth Games and annual ice hockey matches on the Amur River between teams representing the two countries' border regions. We are actively developing exchanges between Russian and Chinese sports federations and professional clubs. For several years now, the Chinese hockey club Kunlun Red Star has played in the Russian Kontinental Hockey League, which was agreed during my visit to China in 2016. Cooperation is also developing in junior hockey. President Xi and I visited one of the games between Russian and Chinese teams in June 2018. The Russian and Chinese years of cooperation in physical education and sports in 2022–2023, which President Xi Jinping and I announced in December 2021, will certainly be a significant, memorable event for our two countries. Its programme includes about 500 various popular and youth sports events, as well as educational, sports science and staff training activities. Activities that prove most successful will continue to be organized on a regular basis. I firmly believe that the Winter Olympic Games in Beijing will be held to the highest standards. I wish successful performance and luck to all athletes, participants in the Olympics, and bright unforgettable moments and joy to the guests. Shen Haixiong: Initially, China and Russia viewed each other as friendly nations and then they established the relations of constructive partnership, strategic partnership, comprehensive partnership and strategic interaction. In June 2019, we took them to an even higher level, opening a new era in our relations. During a videoconference on 28 June 2021, you and President Xi Jinping announced the extension of the Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation. How important do you think this step is for the bilateral relations? Vladimir Putin: The Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation signed more than 20 years ago is a basic policy document that established the legal framework for a long-term consistent development of the Sino-Russian relations of comprehensive partnership and strategic interaction. That is why, on June 28 last year, President Xi Jinping and I decided to extend it for another five years. It is a very rich document in terms of ideas contained in it, many of its provisions being rediscovered in the context of today's rapidly changing international environment. Relations between Russia and China are developing on an equal, de-ideologised basis. Our partnership is sustainable, intrinsically valuable, not affected by the political climate and not aimed against anyone. It is underpinned by respect, regard for each other's core interests, adherence to international law and the UN Charter. The atmosphere of political trust created, among other things, thanks to this treaty, has allowed our countries to establish a multilayer structure of interstate cooperation, with meetings of the two leaders playing a key role. China remains firmly at the top of the list of Russia's trade partners. According to preliminary data, last year, even despite the pandemic-related restrictions, our bilateral trade reached a historic high, totalling 140 billion dollars. China is our strategic partner in the international arena. Our approaches to most issues on the global agenda concur or are really close. We engage in close coordination within many leading multilateral organizations and formats, such as the UN, BRICS, SCO, G20, APEC and EAS, which has a stabilizing effect on the current difficult world situation. To sum up, I would like to reiterate that the concepts laid out in the Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation have allowed our countries to achieve an unprecedentedly high level of partnership, fundamentally changed its character and scope, and created the conditions enabling us to move forward together. Shen Haixiong: If you don't mind, I would like to ask my last question on behalf of all internet users and winter sports lovers in China. In an interview you gave me three years ago you said you were""trying"" to play hockey. However, that appears to be quite an understatement. In a Night Hockey League match held in May last year, you scored a goal just 30 seconds into the game and a total of 8 goals in the entire match, which is comparable to the results of professional hockey players. Could you share any secrets of your prowess with Chinese ice hockey enthusiasts? Do you have any ideas as to who of the Russian hockey players will score the first goal at the Olympic Games? What winter sports other than ice hockey would you like to master? Vladimir Putin:I am not in a position to give any advice to people who are passionate about hockey. I would leave this to professional hockey players and coaches. I think the most important thing is to do your favourite sport– no matter what it is– on a routine basis and to work hard keeping your goal in sight. Over time, mastery will come. Ice hockey in Russia is big and has deep-rooted traditions. A special place here belongs to the Night Hockey League established in 2011. Today, it brings together almost 1100 teams with more than 20 thousand players from most regions of our country. Many of our renowned Olympic and world champions are actively involved in the development of the project, for which I am very grateful. The success achieved is evident. Last year, the number of amateur ice hockey players in Russia amounted to over 620 thousand, and that number is constantly growing. It is always a great pleasure for me to take part in the events of the League whenever my schedule allows. Every chance I get, I go alpine skiing. However, there are other sports disciplines I am interested in. I like biathlon and figure skating, where our athletes have traditionally been very strong. I enjoy watching competitions in ski flying but, for lack of time, can only do it on TV. Of course, we expect our hockey team to show its best performance at the upcoming Olympics. Russia's ice hockey squad is well-prepared, united by the team spirit and the will to win, and all its members are capable of scoring the first goal. There is no doubt that the hockey matches at the Olympics will, as always, be exciting and memorable. We are looking forward to seeing some fine play and, naturally, trust in our players and wish them every success."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67694,"Article by Vladimir Putin ""Russia and China: A Future-Oriented Strategic Partnership"" for the Chinese News Agency Xinhua",2022-02-03T02:00:00Z,NA,,"On the eve of my upcoming visit to China, I am pleased to address directly the large Chinese and foreign audience of Xinhua, the world's largest news agency. Our countries are close neighbours bound by centuries-old traditions of friendship and trust. We highly appreciate that Russian-Chinese relations of comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation, entering a new era, have reached an unprecedented level and have become a model of efficiency, responsibility, and aspiration for the future. The basic principles and guidelines for joint work were defined by our countries in the Treaty of Good Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation, the twentieth anniversary of which we celebrated last year. These are, first and foremost, equality, consideration of one another's interests, freedom from political and ideological circumstances, as well as from the vestiges of the past. These are the principles we are consistently building on year after year in the spirit of continuity to deepen our political dialogue. Despite the difficulties caused by the coronavirus pandemic, we are striving to dynamically build the capacity of economic partnerships and expand humanitarian exchanges. During the upcoming visit, the President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping and I will thoroughly discuss key issues on the bilateral, regional, and global agendas. It is symbolic that our meeting will take place during the Spring Festival– the Chinese Lunar New Year. After all, as the Chinese saying goes,""make your whole year's plan in the spring"". The development of business ties will certainly be given special attention. There is every opportunity for this as our countries have substantial financial, industrial, technological and human resources allowing us to successfully resolve long-term development issues. By working together, we can achieve stable economic growth and improve the well-being of our citizens, strengthen our competitiveness, and stand together against today's risks and challenges. At the end of 2021, the volume of mutual trade increased by more than a third, exceeding the record level of 140 billion U.S. dollars. We are well on the way towards our goal of increasing the volume of trade to 200 billion U.S. dollars a year. A number of important initiatives are being implemented in the investment, manufacturing, and agro-industrial sectors. In particular, the portfolio of the Intergovernmental Commission on Investment Cooperation includes 65 projects worth over 120 billion U.S. dollars. This is about collaboration in such industries as mining and mineral processing, infrastructure construction, and agriculture. We are consistently expanding the practice of settlements in national currencies and creating mechanisms to offset the negative impact of unilateral sanctions. A major milestone in this work was the signing of the Agreement between the Government of Russia and the Government of the PRC on payments and settlements in 2019. A mutually beneficial energy alliance is being formed between our countries. Along with long-term supplies of Russian hydrocarbons to China, we have plans to implement a number of large-scale joint projects. The construction of four new power units at Chinese nuclear power plants with the participation of Rosatom State Corporation launched last year is one of them. All this significantly strengthens the energy security of China and the Asia region as a whole. We see an array of opportunities in the development of partnerships in information and communication technologies, medicine, space exploration, including the use of national navigation systems and the International Lunar Research Station project. A serious impetus to strengthening bilateral ties was given by the cross Years of Russian-Chinese Scientific, Technical and Innovative Cooperation in 2020–2021. We are grateful to our Chinese colleagues for their assistance in launching the production of Russian Sputnik V and Sputnik Light vaccines in China and for the timely supply of necessary protective equipment to our country. We hope that this cooperation will develop and strengthen. One of Russia's strategic objectives is to accelerate the social and economic upliftment of Siberia and the Russian Far East. These territories are immediate neighbors of the PRC. We also intend to actively develop interregional ties. Thus, the modernization of the Baikal-Amur Mainline and the Trans-Siberian Railway has been started. By 2024, their capacity must increase one and a half times through higher volumes of transit cargo and reduced transport time. The port infrastructure in the Russian Far East is also growing. All this should further enhance the complementarity of the Russian and Chinese economies. And, of course, the conservation of nature and shared ecosystems remains an important area of bilateral cross-border and interregional cooperation. These issues have always been the focus of our countries' public attention, and we will certainly discuss them in detail during the negotiations, as well as a wide range of humanitarian topics. Russia and China are countries with thousands of years of unique traditions and tremendous cultural heritage, the interest in which is persistently high both in our countries and abroad. It is true that in the last two years the number of tourists, joint mass events, and direct contacts between our citizens has reduced due to the pandemic. However, I have no doubt that we will catch up and, as soon as the situation allows, will launch new outreach and educational programs to introduce our citizens to the history and present-day life of the two countries. Thus, President Xi Jinping and I have agreed to hold the Years of Russian-Chinese cooperation in physical fitness and sports in 2022 and 2023. Certainly, an important part of the visit will be a discussion of relevant international topics. The coordination of the foreign policy of Russia and China is based on close and coinciding approaches to solving global and regional issues. Our countries play an important stabilizing role in today's challenging international environment, promoting the democratization of the system of interstate relations to make it more equitable and inclusive. We are working together to strengthen the central coordinating role of the United Nations in global affairs and to prevent the international legal system, with the UN Charter at its centre, from being eroded. Russia and China are actively cooperating on the broadest agenda within BRICS, RIC, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, as well as other associations. Within the G20, we are committed to taking national specifics into account when formulating our recommendations, be it the fight against pandemics or the implementation of the climate agenda. Thanks to a large extent to our countries' shared solidarity, following the 2021 G20 Summit in Rome informed decisions were made on international cooperation to restore economic growth, recognize vaccines and vaccine certificates, optimize energy transitions, and reduce digitalization risks. We also have convergent positions on international trade issues. We advocate maintaining an open, transparent and non-discriminatory multilateral trading system based on the rules of the World Trade Organization. We support relaunching of global supply chains. Back in March 2020, Russia proposed an initiative on""green trade corridors"" that excludes any sanctions, political and administrative barriers. Its implementation is a useful aid to overcoming the economic consequences of the pandemic. The XXIV Olympic Winter Games starting in Beijing are a major event of global significance. Russia and China are leading sporting nations renowned for their sporting traditions and not once have hosted the largest international competitions with dignity. I fondly remember my visit to Beijing in August 2008 to attend the 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. Guests and athletes from Russia will remember the vivid performance for a long time, and the Games themselves were organized with the scale and exceptional hospitality inherent to our Chinese friends. For our part, we were delighted to host President Xi Jinping at the opening of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Sadly, attempts by a number of countries to politicize sports to the benefit of their ambitions have recently intensified. This is fundamentally wrong and contrary to the very spirit and principles of the Olympic Charter. The power and greatness of sports are that it brings people together, gives moments of triumph and pride for the country and delights with fair, just and uncompromising competition. And these approaches are shared by most of the states participating in the international Olympic Movement. Our Chinese friends have done tremendous work to prepare well for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. I am convinced that China's extensive experience in the excellent organization of representative international competitions will make it possible to hold this festival of world sports at the highest level. I would like to wish the Russian and Chinese teams impressive results and new records! I send my warmest congratulations to the friendly people of China on the occasion of the Spring Festival, which marks the beginning of the Year of the Tiger. I wish you good health, prosperity, and success."

I am sincerely happy to welcome you all to the Kremlin and to present state awards. Each of you has your own destiny, your own""life line"". But what all of you have in common is your dedication to working for the good of your native country, society, for the good of our citizens. Your achievements have opened up new horizons in various fields and continue to do so; they serve Russia's modern development, make a great contribution to its successful future, and provide an example of dedication, duty, determination and daring to make difficult and often out-of-the-box decisions. Such an example is especially significant now, when both Russia and the world are going through the trials of the coronavirus pandemic. True, the situation remains difficult. But life goes on. Our solidarity, mutual assistance, and the positive events that can be seen as encouraging milestones are equally important now. The presentation of state honours is just such an event– an expression of deep gratitude to our worthy fellow citizens. Nuclear physicist Yevgeny Velikhov, full member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, has devoted his long and diverse professional career to genuine service to the Motherland. A renowned scientist, who has headed the famous Kurchatov Institute for many years, he has earned indisputable weight and respect in our society. It is also Mr Velikhov's birthday– he turned 87 today. From the bottom of my heart, I wish you all the best and congratulate you on this state award. Yevgeny Krutov, a second-generation test pilot, has rightfully deserved his Hero of the Russian Federation Star. When his fighter jet caught fire, he risked his life to steer it away from residential buildings. Of course, medical workers became real heroes to us, to the Russian public at large, to society and our people during the pandemic. We began to understand the special significance of the work of doctors, nurses, and paramedics and all those who have dedicated themselves to this noble career. Leading professionals are present here. Your selfless work and scientific quest help save lives and facilitate the development of healthcare in the interests of our people. The name of Academician Ivan Dedov is well-known in this country and abroad. An endocrinologist of world renown, he elevated assistance to people with diabetes and other dangerous diseases to an entirely new level. The same is true of our work. From the first days of the pandemic, Maryana Lysenko, the Head Physician of Moscow City Clinical Hospital No. 52, became an example of complete self-devotion, and she embodies the professional and personal qualities that a medical practitioner should possess. Andrei Kaprin, a talented organiser and an oncology surgeon, strives to do everything possible and impossible to save human lives. This is his professional and human motto. He is one of the co-authors and co-initiators of a large-scale programme to combat oncological diseases, now being implemented in this country. The Federal Medical Biological Agency, headed by Veronika Skvortsova, has been working in an extremely difficult and intensive way all this time. I would like to cordially thank all our medical workers, including those who are receiving awards today, and hundreds of thousands of your colleagues and friends who selflessly serve their profession, society, the country and the people. Loyalty to our values, which are vividly and broadly reflected in national culture, has always helped us overcome any trials and ordeals. Viktor Zakharchenko and Pyotr Shaboltai have devoted themselves to work in this sphere. Vitaly Ignatenko has accomplished a lot to strengthen Russia's cultural space and support our compatriots abroad. Friends, A solid basis for improving the quality and standard of living of the people, undoubtedly the basis for everything is the sustainable development of the economy itself, including the work of key industries and backbone companies. They have a great responsibility both for carrying out fundamentally important tasks within the country, for social obligations, and for strengthening Russia's capacity as a whole, including its export capacity and its position in foreign markets. And today, high awards will be presented to Alexei Miller, CEO of Gazprom, and Nikolai Tokarev, President of Transneft. In general, I would like to note that the domestic fuel and energy sector shows good dynamics today, making a significant contribution to national economic growth. Our common progress is, of course, made up of the success of many enterprises, industries, design bureaus, and research centres, of their increased efficiency and competitiveness. Viktor Polyakov's labour and professional efforts are directed at solving precisely such problems. He is in charge of the development of engines, notably for aviation, including our promising MS-21 airliner. Dear friends, I repeat, your achievements evoke a feeling of the sincerest pride and give confidence that the history of Russia's successes and outstanding accomplishments will certainly be continued. I heartily congratulate you on your well-deserved awards. I wish you good health, of course. And I wish the very best to you and your families. Thank you. <…> Vladimir Putin: My dear friends, Regarding the Orthodox world, His Grace Illarion said,""We did not create it, and it is not for us to destroy."" Of course. I can say this about the entire Russian world, which is, like our country(strange as it may sound at first, but this is the case) multi-religious and multi-ethnic. The Russian world is so diverse and enormous. We did not create it. Our mission is to strengthen it, develop it and make it attractive for our citizens and for the rest of the world. And we can do this and are doing this owing to people like you, owing to your personal efforts. Our deepest gratitude to you. All the best. I congratulate you on receiving the state awards."

Patriarch Kirill: Thank you kindly. Vladimir Putin: The entire Russian Orthodox Church celebrates Enthronement Day as a holiday. This is a special event in the life of the Russian Orthodox Church and also the entire country because the role of the Church in the life of society is growing and it has become very important in recent years. Everything you are doing to promote peace and harmony in Russia, in our country, and to maintain social well-being in society is extremely important for our country. I would like to congratulate you once again and wish you all the best. Patriarch Kirill: Thank you so much for your kind words, Mr President. Throughout its history, the Church has strived to do everything it can to help people become better and lead better lives. This is a dual goal. The Church is always concerned about the living conditions of people, their material and spiritual circumstances. It is concerned about ensuring the continuous spiritual development of each individual regardless even of whatever difficulties are encountered in life. This has been the mission of the Church for two thousand years. It is not always completely successful in resolving its tasks, but I thank the Lord for what the Church is doing today. It is doing all it can to improve the lives of people and to help people grow, primarily spiritually and intellectually, and even become physically healthier. Vladimir Putin: My greetings, your Holiness. Patriarch Kirill: Thank you, Mr President. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67691,Meeting with Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orban,2022-02-01T20:10:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orban had a brief meeting following their joint news conference.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much for finding time to come here. In my view, the meeting was very productive. I should say it was unprecedented both in terms of duration and its results because we actually addressed the issues you raised. Importantly, they are practically all solvable. Thank you very much again, and I wish you all the best! I am sorry that we have to keep our distance while communicating due to restrictions. However, it did not prevent us from discussing all issues of mutual interest. Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orban(retranslated): Thank you very much. We have discussed all issues. I am very satisfied with the progress in Russian-Hungarian relations. Hungary is a country of totally different dimension than Russia. Obviously, issues of global politics can be resolved only by big countries. However, I really hope that we did manage to make a contribution to strengthening peace and reaching agreements. Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much. See you again! We will always be in contact."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67690,News conference following Russian-Hungarian talks,2022-02-01T20:05:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, We are very happy to welcome and receive the Prime Minister of Hungary, Mr Orban, here in Moscow. Our talks with the Prime Minister took place in a constructive and businesslike atmosphere, which is traditional for Russian-Hungarian relations. I can say that we have discussed most of the issues we wanted to review. Our meeting lasted for almost five hours. We discussed in detail the entire package of bilateral cooperation issues. We reviewed the results of implementing the agreements reached during our visit to Budapest in 2019. We mapped out new and large plans for cooperation in the future. Naturally, we also reviewed a number of current international and regional issues. I will emphasise that Hungary is one of Russia's most important partners in Europe. Despite the complicated situation with the coronavirus pandemic, our trade in 11 months of last year increased by 30 percent– up to US$5.5 billion. Reciprocal investment is almost US$1 billion. The Russian-Hungarian Intergovernmental Commission on Economic Cooperation is doing a good job. Its members discussed in practical terms new mutually beneficial projects in various areas during its regular, fourteenth meeting in Obninsk last November. Per tradition, energy occupies a special place in our bilateral economic partnership. For many years, Russia has provided Hungary with failsafe fuel supplies, covering about 55 percent of Hungary's oil consumption and over 80 percent of gas. Russia supplies Hungary with natural gas under long-term contracts that were extended last year to 2036. Thus, Hungarian consumers can buy gas at prices below the market spot prices that have substantially increased in Europe recently. It is also important that Russian gas is distributed further into Western Europe through Hungarian territory. Hungary has invariably confirmed its reputation as a reliable partner in the transit of Russian fuels. Naturally, we are willing to build up mutually advantageous cooperation in this area, also taking into account the role of natural gas as the cleanest and most eco-friendly fuel as we transition to a green economy. I should note that the Hungarian MOL Group is involved in developing Russian oil deposits in Orenburg Region that produce around 500,000 tonnes of oil every year. Moreover, last year, MOL and Tatneft launched construction of a state-of-the-art bitumen production facility in Nizhnekamsk. Russia and Hungary are working on a large strategic nuclear energy project. Rosatom is building two new energy units at the Paks Nuclear Power Plant, which will increase the plant's capacity by more than 100 percent, to 4,400 MW. We discussed cooperation in industrial production– specifically, on the important Russian-Hungarian project focusing on railway carriage manufacturing and export to third countries, mainly Egypt. As of the beginning of 2022, Egyptian railway companies have already obtained 600 new modern and comfortable coaches. We are to deliver 700 more carriages under the contract. This provides a workload for our industrial facilities and decent wages for our workers. Prime Minister Orban and I also discussed freight shipping from China via Russia to Hungary, Southern Europe, and the Balkans. We expect that a joint venture that our countries agreed to establish will be launched during the first half of this year. Russia and Hungary closely cooperate in healthcare and medicine production and coordinate their COVID-19 countermeasures as partners. As you know, Hungary was the first European country to approve and even use Russia's Sputnik V vaccine and to recognise Russian vaccination certificates. Last year, we supplied 2 million doses of Sputnik V to Hungary and we plan to localise its production in the country. In addition, we are also discussing a supply of Sputnik Light vaccines that can be used as a booster in addition to other foreign vaccines. Another example of successful Russian-Hungarian cooperation in healthcare is involvement of the Gedeon Richter holding in upgrading an integrated pharmaceutical plant in Yegoryevsk. Also, in cooperation with our Hungarian partners, we are building a plant in Obninsk that will produce advanced implants and prosthetic devices. During the talks, we certainly covered humanitarian cooperation. There is a Russian-Hungarian cultural cooperation programme for the period up to 2024. Last year, Hungary successfully hosted the Days of Russian Spiritual Culture. Our countries are engaged in extensive research and academic exchanges, organising exhibitions, concerts and other cultural events. Hungarian students study at Russian universities, including on a tuition-free basis. I would especially like to thank the Hungarian party for supporting Moscow's bid to host the World Expo 2030. It is common knowledge that over the past 170 years Russia has been involved in the international exhibition movement, and it was represented at the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London, the first such event. However, Russia has never hosted any World Expo on its territory. And we strongly hope that Moscow, one of the most rapidly developing mega-cities, a widely recognised leader in terms of introducing digital, environmentally friendly and other innovative technologies into the urban environment, will be given this opportunity. We touched upon the current status of relations between Russia and the European Union while reviewing international subjects. Naturally, we discussed the resolution of the Ukrainian conflict and the overall situation in Ukraine, including in the sphere of human rights, the violation of human rights having become systemic there. As we know, Hungarian partners are also exerting energetic efforts to resolve this problem. We also had a detailed exchange of opinions regarding Russian proposals to the United States and NATO on providing Russia with long-term legally binding security guarantees. We would like to note that we are closely analysing the written replies obtained on January 26 from the United States and NATO. But it is already obvious that principled Russian concerns have been ignored and I have informed the Prime Minister about this. We can see that they have failed to adequately address our three key demands concerning the prevention of NATO's expansion, a refusal to deploy offensive weapon systems near Russian borders and the return of the Bloc's European military infrastructure to 1997 levels when the NATO-Russia Founding Act was signed. At the same time, while ignoring our concerns, the United States and NATO are referring to the right of states to freely choose specific methods to ensure their security. But this is not only about providing someone with the right to freely choose methods to ensure their security. This is only one part of the well-known indivisible security formula. The second inalienable part implies that it is impossible to strengthen anyone's security at the expense of other states' security. In conclusion, I would like to thank Mr Orban for the productive joint work. I am confident that the results of our talks will help further strengthen the diverse Russian-Hungarian partnership. Thank you. Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orban Orban ViktorPrime Minister of Hungary(retranslated): Thank you, Mr President. Good afternoon, hello. Mr President, I would like to thank you for this opportunity to negotiate with you today. We have met in an unusual format because of the Covid-19 pandemic, and I have never sat at such a long table before. Nevertheless, despite the distance, I am quite satisfied with the fact that you and I have managed to discuss all topical matters for so long and in such a detailed manner. You and I have been cooperating for 13 years now, and today's meeting was our 12th. Due to the global geopolitical developments, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the current meeting is the most important. I am here on a peacemaking visit because I was able to highlight that the European Union is a unified entity. This means that not a single EU leader wants a conflict with the Russian Federation to flare up. This is particularly important for us in Central Europe. I was able to tell you how we interpret history. We always stood to lose when a conflict brewed between the West and the East. The long years of the Cold War spelled sorrow and suffering for Hungary. Consequently, we, Hungarians, and other Central European nations are interested in reducing tensions between the West and the East and in doing everything possible to prevent a Cold War and scale down pressure and tensions. In this situation, dialogue and talks are needed to prevent this. I welcome the dialogue between Russia and our Western allies. I have informed you, and I always tell our allies that it is highly important to continue these talks, this dialogue and to use all possible diplomatic tools to resolve the conflict and reduce tensions. What can we offer? We can offer the Hungarian model. The Hungarian model exists in politics: we are members of NATO and the European Union. Nevertheless, we can maintain excellent relations with Russia. This is possible. What do we need for this? We need mutual respect. Hungary has always been respected by President Putin, and we also show such respect for the Russian Federation and President Putin. Though last year was difficult due to the pandemic, it was still the most successful one for our bilateral relations, because our cooperation helped solve major problems and overcome difficulties. First, we needed a vaccine to counter the pandemic, and thanks to your decision, 900,000 Hungarians were able to get the Russian vaccine. The second important issue concerns energy supply. Thanks to you, Mr President, we were able to extend the long-term agreement on the supply of gas from Russia. It turns out that long-term agreements are really of great significance, as we have noted, and we plan to add another billion cubic metres to the annual gas supply. We will negotiate this in the future. Soon a plant will be built in Hungary to produce different types of vaccines, for example, Sputnik V. I hope that we will reach an agreement on this very soon and begin production. With regard to the construction of a nuclear power plant, we hope to obtain the last license soon, which means that the second phase of the process, the construction phase, will start automatically. This will be a great achievement for our country, because we want it to be energy independent and we want to achieve this in the most climate-friendly manner. We have also managed to establish a joint railway company through Russian-Hungarian cooperation. The newly established multimodal terminal plays a very important role in cargo shipments from the East, from China to Western Europe. This joint railway venture will play an important part in providing such an opportunity. We also talked about launching new flights between our two countries. We believe that if there are new regular flights, then more Russian tourists will visit our country. There will also be direct flights to Budapest from two Russian cities, Yekaterinburg and Kaliningrad. We have also been promised further discussions on this matter in the future. Let me thank you for today's talks. We hope that we will be able to cooperate just as successfully in the future, as well. Thank you very much for this opportunity, Mr President. Question(retranslated): Good afternoon. I have a question for both of you. To what extent did you manage to increase and improve energy supply security after today's talks? Thank you very much. Vladimir Putin: The Prime Minister raised a number of questions about expanding our cooperation. This concerns the energy sector and its various aspects, including hydrocarbon supplies, namely gas supply volumes. This concerns the nuclear power industry, logistics, the transport sector, industrial production and agriculture. During talks with the Prime Minister, I contacted my colleagues in the Government and some heads of certain major Russian companies. They gave a positive response to virtually all the issues raised by the Prime Minister. This also concerns expanded gas supplies. Indeed, we need to closely assess the Russian Federation's stock after the autumn-winter period, but I believe that it would not be a major problem for us to supply an additional one billion cubic metres of gas. We understand the issues raised by the Prime Minister. Gas volumes in Europe's underground storage facilities have dwindled to about 40 percent of capacity, and our partners in Europe will probably face problems next year. Hungary will have no problems because we will coordinate additional volumes. I believe that the companies will make the final decision sometime in early April. Overall, the matter has been coordinated. The same concerns a railway to bypass Budapest. The Prime Minister has raised this issue. I believe that we will resolve it. He does not know yet: I received additional information from Russian Railways on my way here. This concerns additional funding from the credit line. It appears that this project can receive $2 billion, and it will be possible to build a route bypassing Budapest. The same can be said about work in the nuclear power industry, personnel-training, the resolution of certain nuclear fuel production issues, and so forth. I completely agree with the Prime Minister that our joint work, which lasted almost five hours today, proved quite successful in all areas. We thoroughly discussed various aspects of agriculture, including the resolution of energy issues. Viktor Orban: I would like to tell Russian journalists that today the cost of gas and electricity in Western Europe has doubled or tripled, which causes great problems for people. We can say that Hungary is an exception. For many years, Hungary has been lowering utilities rates. Russian gas is one of the most important conditions here. If we have Russian gas, we can provide a cheap supply of it to Hungarian households. If there is no Russian gas then we cannot do this. This is why it is very important for the Hungarians that we have come very close to reaching an agreement that Russia will supply us with one billion cubic metres more annually. As a result, we have finally secured the supply in Hungary. The Paks Nuclear Power Plant will cover 90 percent of Hungary's energy requirements by 2030. Without Paks, there would be no corresponding Hungarian environmental policy. Our talks today have made their contribution. Question: Cooperation in countering the coronavirus has already been mentioned at the news conference today. I would like to ask you when the launch of Sputnik V production in Hungary can be expected? Can we expect purchases of Sputnik Light to revaccinate the Hungarians? Might production of Sputnik Light under a patent begin in Hungary? Has this issue been discussed in more detail? Vladimir Putin: I will start, if I may. As far as I know there are no problems with this at the political level. Hungary was the first European country to purchase Sputnik V. Talks are underway now about Sputnik Light. As I have said, it may be a booster vaccine to revaccinate even those who have had a European or American jab. We are now working on the production of Sputnik V in Hungary. Technical work is underway. I hope it will happen as soon as possible. Viktor Orban: We have to obtain seven permits to use Sputnik Light in Hungary. Six have already been granted, so soon Hungary will purchase Sputnik Light. We are a country where all vaccines are available. We have had a positive experience with the use of Sputnik V, so it is good for the Hungarians to have access to this vaccine too. We will launch a modular-type plant that will start operation at the end of the year. There, we will also be able to produce Sputnik V if we agree on this, and why wouldn't we? Vladimir Putin: Hungary has recognised and registered Sputnik V, so the issue raised by the Prime Minister today on increasing the number of flights to Hungary will be considered and I believe resolved positively in the near future. Question(retranslated): At the talks, did you discuss any new aspects of economic cooperation, about which we have heard little up to now? Thank you. Viktor Orban: Firstly, it is important to know that the Russian economy has survived very well despite the sanctions that were imposed on it. If you look at the figures, you will see that the Russian economy is much stronger than is generally thought in the West. Russia is a country of not only past but also future opportunities. Today, we also discussed different new opportunities at our talks. Incidentally, the policy of anti-Russia sanctions has done much more damage to Hungary than to Russia. Russia launched import substitution in the areas where we used to supply it with our goods. Therefore, we lost the market. Russia has been forced to develop in a way that will result in a loss of the market by some countries, including Hungary. In other words, the sanctions policy has been ultimately counterproductive. Its impact is the opposite of what it was intended to be. Sanctions are admittedly doomed to failure. I do not consider them acceptable with regard to either Russia or any other country, for that matter. Hungary made a big investment in the construction of a terminal on its border with Ukraine. This cutting-edge terminal is capable of reloading goods from trucks much faster than any other facility of this kind. This is a tremendous opportunity. We discussed the formation of a Russia-Hungary joint venture on shipments, and I believe we can carry this out successfully. This will improve the Hungarian economy and will allow us to use Hungary's good geographical location. It is suitable for transport routes, pipes, roads and railways. So now, together with Russia, we can make use of this good location. Vladimir Putin: I have already replied to this part of the first question. I said we have good potential in terms of logistics. I would like to confirm what my colleague has just said. Indeed, the Russian Railways executives consider it a feasible project. Moreover, Russian Railways is even willing to set up joint ventures, at the Prime Minister's proposal, for developing this transport infrastructure. We are also interested in this and are ready to work in this area and others. I have already spoken about agriculture. There is traditional agriculture: supplies of Hungarian products to our market. There is also an agriculture that is not quite traditional. It is possible to use Russian agricultural lands for producing goods that are in very high demand in the world market. There are many such goods and we have just discussed this. It is one of the potential areas of our efforts. Question: Good afternoon. I have a question for both leaders, if I may. This is a question for the Prime Minister of Hungary as the leader of a country that is a member of both the EU and NATO: what can you tell us about Russia's talks with the alliance, the USA and the OSCE? And a question for the Russian leader. You just said that the US and NATO's responses are ignoring our main concerns. But I would still like to make it clear: in what form will you respond to these papers and, most importantly, what specifically will you say? Maybe you can tell us a bit more about the content of these papers and your response? And what can you tell us about the security situation in Ukraine? Kiev officials say that if the Minsk agreements are carried out, the country will be split up. Thank you. Viktor Orban: The situation is complicated and the differences are substantial. The whole world should know what Russia wants. Obviously, the responses given to these apprehensions, that is, Russia's security needs, and NATO's response to them are very far from each other at this point. Even though it is a great distance, it cannot be called insurmountable. I was convinced today that these differences can be overcome and it is possible to reach agreements that will guarantee peace and security for Russia and that will be acceptable to the NATO member states as well. So, such an agreement is possible, and I am hoping that the talks will lead to this in the coming days and weeks. Vladimir Putin: I would like to explain once again the logic of our actions and our proposals. It is common knowledge that we were promised that the NATO bloc infrastructure would not expand eastward by one inch. Everyone knows this. Today we see where NATO is: in Poland, in Romania and in the Baltic states. They said one thing but did another. As people say, they flaked out on us; they simply cheated. All right, that is it. Then later, the United States walked out on the ABM Treaty. We tried for a long time to persuade our partners not to do this. It is one of the fundamental treaties on global security. Nevertheless, the US did what it did– withdrew from the treaty. Now anti-ballistic missile launchers are deployed in Romania and are being set up in Poland. They will probably be there soon if they are not yet built. These are MK-41 launchers that can launch Tomahawks. In other words, they are no longer just counter-missiles, and these assault weapons can cover thousands of kilometres of our territory. Isn't this a threat to us? Now they say Ukraine is the next step. It should be admitted into NATO. Listen attentively to what I am saying. It is written into Ukraine's doctrines that it wants to take Crimea back, by force if necessary. This is not what Ukrainian officials say in public. This is written in their documents. Suppose Ukraine is a NATO member. It will be filled with weapons, modern offensive weapons will be deployed on its territory just like in Poland and Romania– who is going to prevent this. Suppose it starts operations in Crimea, not to mention Donbass for now. This is sovereign Russian territory. We consider this matter settled. Imagine that Ukraine is a NATO country and starts these military operations. What are we supposed to do? Fight against the NATO bloc? Has anyone given at least some thought to this? Apparently not. Now, regarding the implementation of the Minsk agreements. On the one hand, we hear statements from Ukraine that it wants to implement them, while we are constantly accused of not implementing the Minsk agreements. On the other hand, we hear public statements to the effect that Ukraine will collapse if it carries out these agreements. Has anyone thought that if they create such threats against Russia, they will only be creating similar threats against themselves? All these issues require very careful analysis and consideration for each other's interests. We are being told that each country has the right to choose its own security system. We agree, but I still believe the United States is not that concerned about Ukraine's security, though they may think about it on the sidelines. Its main goal is to contain Russia's development. This is the whole point. In this sense, Ukraine is simply a tool to reach this goal. This can be done in different ways: by drawing us into some armed conflict, or compelling its allies in Europe to impose tough sanctions on us like the US is talking about today, or by drawing Ukraine into NATO, deploying attack weapons there and encouraging some Banderites to resolve the issues of Donbass or Crimea by force. In this way, we could be drawn into an armed conflict regardless. If we take a serious look at these numerous issues, it will become clear that to prevent the situation from taking such a negative turn, and we want to avoid it, it is necessary to thoroughly consider the interests of all countries, including Russia, and find a solution to this problem. Why did we sign the treaties and related agreements in Istanbul and Astana that say that no country can ensure its own security at the expense of another's security? We are saying that Ukraine's accession into NATO will undermine our security, and we are asking our partners to consider this. They talk about an open-door policy. Where did this come from? Or that NATO has an open-door policy. Where does it say so? Nowhere. If my memory does not fail me, Article 10 of the 1949 NATO Treaty reads that the Parties may, by unanimous agreement, accept any other European State to the treaty. So, they can do this, but are not required to. After all, the United States and NATO can tell Ukraine, and others: we want to ensure your security, we value it and respect your aspirations, but we cannot accept you because we have other international commitments that we adopted earlier. What is unclear or even offensive for Ukraine in this explanation? We need to find a way to ensure the interests and security of all parties to this process: Ukraine, the other European countries and Russia. But this can only be done if the documents we proposed undergo a serious, thoughtful analysis. I hope this process will be continued. I also agreed with the President of France yesterday that he can come to Moscow in the near future to discuss these problems as well. I hope we will eventually find a solution, although we realize it is not simple. But, of course, I am not yet ready to talk today about what it will be. Thank you."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67682,Talks with Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orban,2022-02-01T19:20:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin held talks with Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orban in the Kremlin.,"The discussion focused on the further development of bilateral cooperation in trade, economic, energy, cultural and humanitarian areas as well as current European security issues. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, dear Viktor, I am very happy to see you! We have not seen each other since 2019 due to certain events that do not allow us to communicate normally even now. However, a direct meeting, a direct dialogue is much better than a telephone conversation. I would like to mention some things I consider important. First, despite the restrictions, and we are even trying to counter COVID-19 together, we have supplied you with over 2 million doses of the vaccine; we have registered our Sputnik Light in your country, and now we are studying the issue of transferring technology and production to Hungarian territory. Despite the restrictions we still managed to increase trade by 30 percent last year, in the first 11 months of last year. This is a good sign, a good signal of economic recovery. We continue large projects, such as Paks – two new units, the construction of a nuclear power plant. In general, energy is a big part of our cooperation: 55 percent of oil and 80 percent of natural gas consumed by Hungary come from Russia. Everything in this area is working smoothly. We are also making headway in engineering. We have a good joint contract to build carriages for Egypt. I believe that in general the situation is developing well in this area. Last year, Gazprom signed two long-term contracts for the supply of natural gas from Russia to Hungary through to 2036. So, the stability of these supplies is guaranteed. And, of course, it is very important for me to exchange views with you on the current situation with European security. As you know, we sent our proposals to NATO and the United States on signing the relevant written mutual commitments in this area, and I will be glad to tell you how this process is developing. I am very happy to see you. Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orban Orban ViktorPrime Minister of Hungary (retranslated): I am very happy that we can meet with each other. I always consider a personal meeting with you a great honour for me. We first met 13 years ago, so this happens to be our 12th meeting. This is very rare. Most of my colleagues in leadership positions in the EU countries since that time no longer hold their positions. So it happens that you and I have accumulated the most significant memories about the common past of Russia and the European Union over these 13 years. Frankly, I am not planning to quit. Our elections are scheduled for April. Vladimir Putin: Yes, I know. Viktor Orban: I am running again and hope to win. So I have the reasonable assumption that we will cooperate with you for many years to come. We are indeed going through hard times, but 2021 has probably been the most successful for relations between our countries over this period. There have been two major challenges, and Russia helped us with both. The first challenge was linked with vaccines and the second one with energy. We are grateful to you that our cooperation allowed us to inoculate 900,000 Hungarian citizens with your vaccine. Thank you from my heart for this. Considering that Europe is going through an energy or rather a gas crisis now, it was very important to sign the afore-mentioned long-term contracts. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to sign them. During this meeting, I would like to come to terms on increasing volumes. As for security, this is probably the most worrying issue because my current visit is partly a mission of peace, and I would like to assure everyone that none of the EU leaders or members want a war. We favour a political solution under beneficial agreements. The Paks project is making great headway. Hungary's investments, made in part with the approval of the Russian leadership, have been a success. We are grateful to you for this. In addition, I have brought several more proposals on further building up cooperation in this area. This is a difficult time, but we are spending it in good company. Vladimir Putin: I agree. (Laughter.) I must say that these agreements through to 2036, signed last year, are primarily a result of your work. In this sense it was important not only to ensure stable supplies through to 2036, but it is also important that now Hungary is buying Russian gas at a rate five times cheaper than the market price in Europe. As we usually say when our partners are having elections, we will work with any elected leader. But I must note that you have done much in your work on the Russian track in both the interests of Hungary and Russia. I hope our cooperation will continue. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67666,Meeting with Minister of Justice Konstantin Chuychenko,2022-01-31T13:45:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with Minister of Justice Konstantin Chuychenko.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon. Minister of Justice Konstantin Chuychenko: Good afternoon, Mr President. Vladimir Putin: Mr Chuychenko, you know that I met with members of the Presidential Council for[Civil Society and] Human Rights, and there were many questions concerning your Ministry. I will not list them all now. I know that you have worked on many of them and that you have relevant proposals and ideas that you too would like to share and discuss. Please, let us begin. Konstantin Chuychenko: Mr President, let me present two problems pertaining to the activities of the penal and correctional system. At the present time, about 100,000 people are released from prison facilities every year. But often these people are not ready for life outside prison walls: they cannot get a job, lack the money necessary to start a new life, and, of course, they need help. In this connection, the level of backsliding is very high– about 44 percent– which means that 44,000 people out of every 100,000 will return to prison. We think that this problem should be addressed in all seriousness, and we should start dealing with it well in advance, while they are still in penitentiaries. We suggest creating a relevant service within the Federal Penitentiary Service, which will tackle these issues on a systemic basis, preparing people for release and engaging in their social adaptation, resocialisation, and subsequent rehabilitation. Moreover, this should be done on the basis of an individual programme that will operate, as we see it, for nearly a year. And this will be a person's right rather than a duty. I mean, this system will come into effect with regard to a convict only if he or she agrees to it. I would like to note that the humanitarian component will be of highest importance in the work of the people who will be employed by this service, who work in this field. Clearly, there will be a service component too, but… Vladimir Putin: The financial component is also needed. Konstantin Chuychenko: Certainly! But these people must have competences in the social services area. Properly speaking, their main task is to bring people back to the mainstream, return them to normal human life, so that they do not commit any more crimes. We proceed from the assumption that this service should involve about 50,000 people: these people will possess relevant knowledge, including in the area of psychology. We have now drafted a law on probation. This is the service we are talking about, and we are deliberately discarding the word""inspection"" here because an inspection is more like an oversight and monitoring agency. But this activity is closer to the human soul, and I would daresay that this is a human story. Consequently, these people should possess special knowledge, and we will have to establish an academic discipline for training relevant specialists. And we have already prepared a relevant draft of the law on probation; this document is nearing completion. We are now in the final stage of the approval procedure, and I believe that we will be ready to submit it to the Government for its subsequent submission to the State Duma. Therefore I would like to ask you to approve these steps, and I believe that we will set up the service by mid-2023, maybe not in full force, but already functioning to a considerable extent. We have a proposal in this connection. Since this is a new undertaking, we believe we should work on this project rather seriously. Although the law has not yet been approved, it is necessary to launch all preparatory work now, and to make this whole thing work effectively, I believe we should introduce the position of a deputy director of the Federal Penitentiary Service who will be in charge of probation. I would like to ask you to approve this proposal. Deputy director would start the creation of this service. Vladimir Putin: All right. It appears that you should also keep a register of these people– those who undergo this procedure. Konstantin Chuychenko: Yes, certainly. Of course, we will work on this register. Actually, the initial work will be conducted in prisons, and then, when the person is released, this work will continue. They will be entitled to education opportunities, they will get the assistance needed to gain access to all social services, medical services, and they will get legal and psychological counselling. And, of course, we will help them establish socially beneficial connections. Vladimir Putin: Good. Konstantin Chuychenko: And the second issue, Mr President, is regarding the development of correctional centres. As of today there are about 350,000 people serving terms at correctional facilities. In 2017, a law came into force, under which prison terms can be commuted to correctional labour. Under the current law, about 180,000 convicts can avail themselves of this right. The problem is we do not have the appropriate places for them to serve their sentences. It is clear that far from all 180,000 convicts are eligible for correctional labour because many are simply not on the right track. In this respect, the relevant services will screen the eligible. But we believe that at this moment, about 100,000 prisoners do deserve to be transferred from detention to places they can engage in correctional labour. Those who work at correctional centres are not regarded as prisoners. Legally they are free. But it is understood that they are under criminal punishment, which means that there is a punitive component, and they are subject to certain restrictions. The merit of this measure is that people work, earn money, and are preparing for release. In addition, they are creating a foundation because they receive wages that do not undermine their human dignity, they enjoy normal living conditions, have an opportunity to see their relatives, and visit a[nearby] town. In addition, I can say that this form of punishment is much easier on the federal budget because, for example, it costs 500,000 rubles per convict to create one job, if we are talking about light non-permanent structures. This is much cheaper than creating a job at a detention facility. And, accordingly, they actually pay their own basic costs. Today, we have created 15,000 jobs, and we would like to create about 100,000 jobs by the end of 2024. Consequently, the prison population would dwindle considerably. Vladimir Putin: Let's do this. How has the prison population decreased in the past few years? Konstantin Chuychenko: Mr President, I have here some reference materials which are very interesting, by the way. Look here, please. Vladimir Putin: The 1913 prison population was 194,000. Konstantin Chuychenko: 194,000, and we are talking about the Russian Empire. Vladimir Putin: The population was small. Konstantin Chuychenko: The population was 134 million, and it was not much smaller than the current population. Vladimir Putin: Yes, the Soviet Union had a larger population. Konstantin Chuychenko: The sampling here might not be very accurate. It is necessary to become immersed in the statistics; unfortunately, we do not have the option to compare and verify them. Vladimir Putin: In any event, the number of inmates in 2000 was 1.06 million, and the figure dropped to 483,000 in 2021. Not all these people are in prison; quite a few are in pre-trial detention centres. Konstantin Chuychenko: Yes, 109,000 are currently in pre-trial detention centres. Vladimir Putin: As I understand it, we are talking about 483,000 people in prison, minus 109,000? Konstantin Chuychenko: Minus 109,000, yes. Vladimir Putin: And in 2000, the prison population was 1.06 million. Konstantin Chuychenko: Yes, we have reduced it more than two times over. And, if we accomplish all our plans under the recently approved Concept for developing the penal and correctional system through to 2030, then the prison population will drop to 300,000. Also if we create the system of correction centres, we will considerably reduce the number of inmates. Vladimir Putin: Good. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67657,Telephone conversation with President of France Emmanuel Macron,2022-01-28T16:15:00Z,NA,Vladimir Putin had an extensive telephone conversation with President of the French Republic Emmanuel Macron.,"The leaders exchanged views on the measures that both countries are taking to combat the coronavirus. The main topic of conversation, though, was the issue of providing Russia with long-term and legally binding security guarantees, including in the wake of recent Russia-US talks in Geneva and a NATO-Russia Council meeting in Brussels. Vladimir Putin made it clear that the Russian side would carefully study the written responses to the draft agreements on security guarantees received from the United States and NATO on January 26, after which it would decide on further action. At the same time, attention was drawn to the fact that the US and NATO responses did not address Russia's fundamental concerns such as stopping NATO expansion, not deploying assault weapons near Russia's borders, or rolling NATO's military capacity and infrastructure in Europe back to where they were in 1997 when the NATO-Russia Founding Act was signed. The key question on the United States and its allies' plans to follow the principle of the indivisibility of security was ignored. This principle is enshrined in the OSCE and NATO-Russia basic documents and stipulates that no one should strengthen their security at the expense of the security of other countries. When discussing the situation in Ukraine, Vladimir Putin emphasised the importance of Kiev's strict compliance with the provisions of the Minsk Package of Measures and other agreements, primarily on establishing a direct dialogue with Donetsk and Lugansk and legalising the special status of Donbass. Based on the outcome of the meeting of political advisers to the leaders of the Normandy four countries held in Paris on January 26, the parties reaffirmed their commitment to continuing working in this format. With regard to France's chairmanship of the EU Council in the first half of 2022, Emmanuel Macron briefed Vladimir Putin on Paris's approaches to the pan-European track. It was agreed to continue the Russian-French dialogue on the entire range of European security issues. The state of affairs around the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on the Iranian nuclear programme was reviewed. The proximity of Russia's and France's positions on this was noted. Both countries strongly support continuing international efforts to maintain and implement the JCPOA, and UN Security Council Resolution 2231. Some practical aspects of bilateral cooperation, including nuclear energy, were discussed. The President of Russia and the President of France agreed to stay in close communication."

Mr Falkov will be our key speaker today. He will talk about the creation of 500 new research laboratories, which is a very important topic. However, before we begin, I suggest that we discuss current matters. For starters, I would like to talk about regulating cryptocurrencies. This issue has been on everyone's lips lately. To keep it brief, I will say that I am aware of the ongoing debates on this matter. The Central Bank is working on this and is tasked with regulating this area. Far from seeking to stand in the way of technological progress, the Central Bank is taking the necessary steps to introduce the latest technology in this sphere. As for cryptocurrency, the Central Bank has its own take on this matter. Its experts believe that as this sector expands it creates certain risks, primarily for our people, since high volatility is part of it, and there are other aspects involved too. Of course, we do have certain competitive advantages here, especially when it comes to mining. I am referring to surplus energy and the availability of skilled professionals. I am asking the Government and the Central Bank to discuss this issue in the near future and to reach common ground so you can report on these efforts. This is the first item. Second, the ongoing efforts to fight the coronavirus remain a hot topic. We need to keep a close eye on this, especially now. I would like to ask Ms Golikova to start today's meeting on this topic. Thank you. Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova: Mr President, colleagues, As of today, cases of the Omicron variant have been recorded in 72 regions of the country. Of the detected cases, the retreating Delta strain accounts for 47.9 percent, and Omicron and other non-dominant strains make up 52.1 percent. The hospitalisation rate per 100,000 people was 39 last week, up by 9.3 percent compared to the second week of the year. During the same period, the rate of new detected cases – also per 100,000 people – amounted to 231 and increased by 102.4 percent. Thus, an average of 17 percent were hospitalised out of the total number of new cases detected. (Then Ms Golikova spoke in detail about hospitalisations in the regions, including that of children, detection with increased testing, and the number of COVID beds.) The mortality rate for the first 25 days of January is down 22 percent compared to the same period last year and also 22 percent less than during the first 25 days of December 2021. The herd immunity today is 64.2 percent and, unfortunately, is decreasing in a number of regions. The main reason is the loss of immunity in people who were initially vaccinated or recovered six months ago. In this regard, I want to emphasise once again that vaccination and revaccination continue to protect against severe illness. This is confirmed by all international studies. (Among additional measures implemented by the Government together with the regions, the Deputy Prime Minister listed keeping the healthcare system in a high state of readiness, especially its primary care system; allocating five billion rubles to provide patients with free medicines at the outpatient stage, as well as 15 billion rubles for the centralised procurement of medicines by the Healthcare Ministry to provide inpatient care; the Government's request to the regions to take restrictive measures to comply with the sanitary and epidemiological regime; and allocating another 7.3 billion rubles to the regions for additional financial support and the provision of assistance at the outpatient stage, including payment for medical workers to visit patients.) To help primary healthcare workers, remote technologies will be used when a person with symptoms of the disease or a positive PCR test contacts a medical facility or a call centre. Also available will be remote prescription of medicines, their delivery to the patient and online filing for a sick leave certificate. Also, university students after their third year, and medical college seniors are recruited to work in call centres to collect medical histories and then transfer patients, with about 600 million rubles allocated from the Reserve Fund through the end of January. Almost 70,000 people and 18,500 volunteers from among the students and employees of educational and scientific organisations have been recruited to provide medical care. To help improve the effectiveness of coronavirus prevention and diagnostics, we need to allocate adequate financial resources and adopt corresponding measures. This is why we built up the production of the test systems. We plan to allocate additional funding from the Reserve Fund for express test systems for January-June 2022. We will purchase 60 million express test systems and send them to the Russian regions. In addition, we will increase the volume of COVID-19 pathogen sequencing to detect any further virus mutations in a timely manner. Moreover, in order to slow the spread of the virus, the regions have been instructed to adopt remote work schedules at schools and workplaces as much as possible. On January 21, the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection sent all the regions recommendations on how to prevent the spread of the virus among those who receive social services at inpatient social service facilities. This work is underway. In addition, the ""We Are Together"" movement is working with the public, including the delivery of food, medicines and other essential goods. The Government monitors the situation with the coronavirus and these measures on a daily basis. To do this, the Prime Minister has given instructions to create a response working group, which I chair. This group includes representatives from the federal executive bodies involved in this work, as well as representatives of all 85 Russian regions. Vladimir Putin: Ms Golikova, I see that some children's medical institutions are, unfortunately, suspending their regular work. Still, everything possible must be done, especially for children, so that the planned assistance does not stop. We need to look into this like we did last year and the year before last, this so-called rerouting. We need to see how much we can do and provide the regions in need of this support with the necessary assistance. Tatyana Golikova: Yes, Mr President, we have such efforts planned. We need to adopt a relevant Government resolution by the end of January. We do not plan to interrupt regular medical assistance entirely. In the most difficult cases, we plan to go to emergency status, but some categories of medical assistance will remain as they are, without shutting down. Vladimir Putin: Ok then. We created the COVID 122 hotline. Mr Chernyshenko is in charge. Mr Chernyshenko, the floor is yours. Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko: Mr President, Back in November 2020, we created the 122 single federal hotline as per your instructions to resolve the problem that our citizens had trying to reach medical institutions via telephone. This enabled people across all regions to address their COVID-related needs: get medical advice, make an appointment or call in a doctor. Since its launch, the 122 hotline has received more than 50 million calls. Exactly two weeks ago, you instructed us, the Government, to mobilise our resources, underlining we only had a couple of weeks to prepare for a new pandemic shock. In the past week alone, the number of calls surged several times, reaching 3.5 million at the national level. After your words about mobilising our efforts, we subjected the entire hotline service to a stress test from both a technical perspective, and in terms of human resources. The Government Coordination Centre, together with the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media and the Healthcare Ministry, receive and analyse feedback we get from all regions and directly from people, round-the-clock. We have been also proactively working with the Russian Popular Front, which shares its data with us on surveys and hotline responsiveness around the country. (Dmitry Chernyshenko went on to talk about the challenges call centres have been facing in their work, and the way they are being addressed, in particular, operator training at call centres and their technical equipment.) Mr President, in keeping with your instructions, we installed broadband internet in all medical institutions around the country, including rural paramedic centres. We fulfilled that task. Moving on, together with the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media, we believe that it would be expedient to equip all medical institutions around the country with modern digital telephony systems to transition from obsolete analogue solutions to digital ones. I am talking about IP telephony. By creating a single distributed cloud-based contact centre, we can bring together over a thousand platforms within a single architecture and process an almost limitless number of calls simultaneously. We do hope that the pandemic comes to an end, but we will still need this system once it is over. We have the situation under control, keep in touch with the regions at all times, and assist them as needed. They understand what is being asked of them. It is our understanding that many regions have yet to hit their peak periods. So far, they have been coping with the workload. We are keeping a close eye on the ongoing developments and are hard at work. <…> Vladimir Putin: Let us now turn to Mr Kozlov for a progress report on the Vostok station. Minister of Natural Resources and Environment Alexander Kozlov: Mr President, Mr Prime Minister, colleagues. We are building a new wintering complex for the Vostok station in keeping with the decision you took, Mr President, at the meeting of the Board of Trustees of the Russian Geographical Society in 2019. As we speak, out there in Antarctica a platform is being installed on 36 pillars for building a five-storey building that will accommodate our polar researchers. Alexei Treshnikov, a prominent polar explorer and full member of the Academy of Sciences, opened the Vostok station back in 1957. This is the only Russian station on the continent, located 1,500 kilometres from the coast at an altitude of 3,500 metres above sea level. What makes this station unique is that it sits over Lake Vostok, a subglacial lake with an undisturbed ecosystem that can help us study the climate of the past. Our effort to collect water samples from a borehole reverberated across the scientific community in the previous decade. To carry on with our research, we needed a new wintering complex, designed to provide a safe and comfortable stay for people working in Antarctica. The last time the station was upgraded was back in 1982. It has become obsolete since that time: most facilities are buried deep under snow. Even in the summer the temperature there is minus 30, while during the winter, or for 10 months every year, the temperature can drop as low as minus 80 degrees. The new complex is designed to withstand extreme climate conditions. It is a modular structure where each block can work independently from others. These modules will host research laboratories with their equipment, medical quarters with the capability to perform major surgeries, as well as housing units and recreational areas. Separate modules will house the main and the backup power units. For the first time, the station will have a system for water treatment and mineralisation. During the season, 35 people will be able to live and work there at the same time, including 20 researchers, with others helping them with maintenance. The new station will be 140 metres long, 17 metres wide and almost 14 metres high, like a five-storey building should be. I would like to stress that building a station in Antarctica is an extraordinary undertaking. We delivered all the materials and fuel by sea during autumn 2021. Two container ships, a tanker and an icebreaker brought 6,842 tonnes of cargo to Antarctica's shores, along with 6,000 tonnes of diesel and 112 construction and assembly workers. It took the entire month of December to unload all this in Tala Bay, from where the cargo was taken inland using sledges and tow trucks for a distance of 1,460 kilometres. We have already carried out ten deliveries and are preparing the eleventh. We expect it to be carried out tonight, but it will depend on the weather, of course, because it is essential that people are safe along this challenging route. I would now like to report briefly on the work we carried out this month. We reinforced the snow foundation on an area 200 metres long and 120 metres wide, installed 36 pillars there, each three metres high. This will ensure that the new station is not covered in snow. At the present stage, work is underway to install a platform on these pillars on which the modules will be mounted. There is a window of just two and a half months, from December to mid-February, for carrying out this work. For this reason, construction is expected to take three years. We intend to launch the wintering complex in 2025. <…> Vostok also stands out from a geopolitical perspective. World-class research will be carried out at this station. We will explore the Earth's climate and the gas composition of its atmosphere over the past 1.5 million years to obtain new data on the role greenhouse gases play in climate change. <…> Minister of Science and Higher Education Valery Falkov: Since 2018, the Ministry has been implementing a project on establishing new research laboratories for young scientists. Mr President, the goal you set to ensure Russia's presence among the world's leading scientific and technological powers, defines the researcher's place and role in the economy in a completely new way. The countries that have been in the lead in scientific and technological development in the past few decades are steadily increasing the number of people employed in science. Importantly, this applies to both absolute figures and the number of researchers per 10,000 of the economically active population. This describes the changes in the economic system where new knowledge plays a key role. At the same time, in the post-Soviet period Russia has experienced a decline in the number of researchers. This is one of the main challenges in ensuring Russia's long-term presence among those that set the global technological agenda. Therefore, in recent time we have focused our consistent efforts on attracting young people to science. Much has been achieved in the previous years. The share of people under 39 in R&D is steadily growing. In 2010, they amounted to 35.5 percent, whereas in 2020 their share went up to 44.3 percent. We record a growth every year. It is important not only to introduce new people into well-established teams, but also to give them an opportunity to freely choose their field of research. The history of science, especially the glorious history of Soviet science, provides graphic evidence of this. It is no surprise that the appearance of new areas of research and the renewal of the scientific and, hence, technological agenda are linked with the new and young laboratory heads and new research teams. Since the start of the national project, we have implemented this initiative in three stages. Each of them had its own focus but the basic requirements always remained unchanged. First, the specialisation of laboratories always corresponds to the priorities of the Scientific and Technological Development Strategy of the Russian Federation. Young people are invited to work in them; every lab has at least 10 researchers, out of whom two thirds are under 39. In 2018–2019, emphasis was laid on establishing laboratories in the leading academic institutes. As a result, 300 laboratories were set up with over 3,500 researchers. These laboratories were built in the same institutes that played an active role in the programme for updating equipment. So, on coming to one of these institutes, young researchers immediately received an opportunity to conduct research using cutting-edge equipment. Mr President, I would like to focus on this. Of course, a considerable part of equipment we import is produced elsewhere. We see this as a systemic risk for advanced research and the effort to enhance Russia's appeal as a sponsor of Big Science. For this reason we, jointly with the Ministry of Industry and Trade and our leading universities and research institutes, are discussing approaches to the solution of this problem on a systemic basis and drafting a relevant programme. We are planning to report to you separately shortly. Speaking about the results of the work done at the first stage, I would like to mention the assessment you gave at the October 10, 2021, meeting dedicated to the federal scientific and technical agricultural development programme. Of the 300 laboratories, 100 have been established at agricultural institutes. In line with this initiative, we have managed to enlist over a thousand young scientists, who will engage in agricultural research. In 2020, we chose a different focus, with new youth laboratories created at universities. Fifty-four universities established 80 new laboratories with the annual funding in the amount of 2.2 billion rubles. In 2021, we shifted our focus and created another 120 youth laboratories. The annual funding volume approximated 1.8 billion rubles. This stage has focused on supporting the technological programmes of world-level scientific and educational centres. Pursuant to your instructions, Mr President, we have created 15 scientific and educational centres of this kind. The laboratories were being created with a view to promoting technological projects chosen by the regions, which guaranteed transformation of their regional economies. This is a point of fundamental importance. The regions have launched scientific research based on their practical value for themselves. They are also responsible for the implementation of these projects, while we, accordingly, are supporting them from the federal centre. Apart from the change of focus in creating new laboratories, we, based on the record of the two previous stages, have adjusted and, I should say, somewhat toughened, in the positive sense, the requirements for the laboratories themselves. Specifically, they can be headed by someone not older than 35 years of age, who at the same time has international research experience. It is true that our goal was to secure the return of talented Russian researchers from abroad. Incidentally, not only have our compatriots come back to Russia, but we also see the arrival of young scientists from India, China, Italy, Iran and other countries, who have become laboratory heads at different research and educational centres from the Urals and West Siberia to Southern Russia. Last year, we started implementing a research programme of the national centre of mathematics and physics, which is being created in line with your instructions, Mr President. I am referring to the Greater Sarov project. The Sarov-based institutes have established six new youth laboratories that are pursuing fundamental research in areas essential for the development of Sarov technological potential. Thus, 500 new youth research laboratories have been created to date in three stages: 344 at research organisations and 156 at Russian universities. The funding for all these laboratories amounted to over 8 billion rubles in 2021, total funding exceeded 18 billion rubles, and 6,299 researchers, including 5,306 under age 39, have been attracted to science with the help of this instrument. The first laboratories were established three years ago. This year, we plan to conduct a thorough analysis of the results they have achieved. An initial review of their performance has shown that the scientific effectiveness of these new laboratories is higher than average among the subdivisions of the organisations where they have been established in terms of funds attracted from businesses and special funds, like grants from the Russian Science Foundation, as well as by the number and quality of publications. The professional community regards the experience of these new youth laboratories as very successful. It enjoys demand at academic institutes and universities as an instrument for soft rebooting of the scientific agenda and for ensuring the gradual succession of generations. The regional heads appreciate this experience as an opportunity to influence the scientific and technological agenda in their regions. Most importantly, this instrument has attracted young scientists, who can use it to implement their ambitious ideas, challenge established scientific theories and test their improbable theories. Taken together, this is encouraging young people to take up a career in research, which is ultimately making our country a scientific and technological leader. We plan to create another 400 youth laboratories within the framework of this project by 2024, including 150 laboratories each in 2022 and 2023 and 100 laboratories in 2024. Based on this experience, we believe that it will be expedient to continue this programme and to focus on the priorities you have outlined and about which you spoke in the Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly in 2021. I am referring to new energy uses, new pharmaceuticals and solutions to problems brought on by climate change. This concludes my report. Thank you for the attention. Vladimir Putin: Mr Falkov, thank you. I hope this work will continue. It is very important to mention the role played by the regions, which joined this project at the very beginning in order to make use of its results for the development of their economies. Mr Falkov, I would like to point out one thing. You mentioned publications. Of course, this is a very important way to evaluate scientific results, but we have talked about this many times and have listened to the opinions of the heads of academic institutes, who believe that it is an important but not the only criterion and method for assessing the quality of scientific projects. We have said this as well. Of course, we need to think about additional instruments for assessing this work. Overall, it is progressing very well. I would like to thank everyone who is organising this work. Colleagues, we are concluding this meeting. Do the meeting participants have additional information or any other comments, including anything outside the agenda? No? In this case, thank you very much, and all the best."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67638,Meeting with representatives of Italian business community,2022-01-26T16:00:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region","Vladimir Putin held a videoconference meeting with heads of leading Italian companies. The discussion focused on trade, economic and investment cooperation between Russia and Italy and prospects for further expanding bilateral business ties.","President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, good afternoon. I am delighted to have this opportunity to meet with leading Italian entrepreneurs, our colleagues and friends. When we met in October 2018, we had a constructive conversation about the prospects for expanding trade, economic and investment ties between Russia and Italy. Many of your useful recommendations have been taken into account in our ongoing work to create a favourable climate for growth and development of the economic environment, to improve economic regulation and the business climate that I just mentioned, including attracting foreign investment. Of course, due to the coronavirus pandemic, business contacts have become difficult, and the generally volatile situation in the global economy is not helping with new projects and initiatives. However, we can state with satisfaction that our countries have managed to maintain cooperation on the economic track at a fairly high level. In January-November 2021, bilateral trade grew by 53.8 percent to $27.5 billion. I fully expect it to exceed $30 billion when we finish the calculations. Colleagues, I propose focusing today's discussion on your concerns– topics that are of the essence for our colleagues, investors, entrepreneurs working in Russia and interested in expanding commercial ties with our country, to discuss the most pressing aspects of Russian-Italian economic cooperation. I would like to emphasise that we consider Italy one of Russia's leading economic partners. Your country is Russia's third largest trade partner in the EU. Italian companies' investments in Russia's economy amount to about $5 billion, and Russian investments in Italy are estimated at about $3 billion. The Russian-Italian Investment Platform, which was established in 2019 jointly with the Russian Direct Investment Fund to finance large capital-intensive joint projects, is operating very effectively. There are some 500 Italian companies in Russia. The range of industries where they operate is truly impressive: power generation, steel, oil and gas, petrochemical industries, helicopter manufacturing, high technologies, agribusiness, transport infrastructure, banking, insurance and many other sectors. In particular, we are satisfied with the successful development of cooperation with Italian companies and banks in large-scale energy projects, such as Yamal LNG and Arctic LNG 2, in which over 60 Italian companies are involved. Italian producers of high-tech equipment are also actively contributing to the Vostok Oil project, which Rosneft is carrying out in the Krasnoyarsk Territory in the north of Russia. Russia is a reliable supplier of energy resources to Italian consumers. In 2021, Gazprom delivered 22.7 billion cubic metres of natural gas to Italy or much more than in 2020, when it supplied 20.8 billion. I would like to point out that Italian energy companies continue working with Gazprom on the basis of long-term contracts and can therefore buy Russian gas cheaper, I would even say much cheaper than spot market prices, which have increased considerably against the backdrop of a cold winter and a supply shortage. There are also good prospects for boosting Russian-Italian business partnership in other energy sectors, primarily the development, use and commercialisation of renewable energy sources. Italian business has invested some 500 million euros in the construction of wind farms in three Russian regions: the Stavropol Territory, Rostov in southern Russia and the Murmansk Region in the north. The Murmansk wind power project will be used to produce green hydrogen for export to Europe. Incidentally, Russia has recently taken a number of major steps towards creating a low-carbon economy. You may be aware of our plans, which I have already mentioned, to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 while maintaining sustainable economic growth. Russia has considerable resources and technological potential, which we intend to use for developing green energy. Within the next few years, pilot projects to produce hydrogen with a low level of greenhouse emissions and to use it in the power industry, transport and industrial sector will get underway. The Hydrogen Energy Development Concept is being put into practice, and by 2035 Russia may become one of the world's biggest producers and exporters of hydrogen. We are interested in foreign, including Italian, businesspeople feeling as comfortable as possible in the Russian market. We are taking measures on a systemic basis to improve the business and investment climate. An important role in this sense is played by the Foreign Investment Advisory Council under the Government of Russia. For the last 26 years, this Council has worked on improving the conditions of business enterprise. Russia regularly holds numerous international economic forums. You know all of them: I am referring to the St Petersburg and Eastern forums, the INNOPROM expo in Yekaterinburg, and others. By tradition, Italian companies are actively involved in these events. Last year, a special session of the Russian-Italian business dialogue was organised on the sidelines of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, while at INNOPROM Italy was a partner country. I would like to specifically mention the fact that Russia's capital, Moscow, has submitted a bid to hold the world's fair, EXPO 2030. We know, of course, colleagues, that Rome is also a candidate city. Moreover, Italy already has hosted a world's fair. Our country has never done this, although it has been involved in this event for the last 170 years. Russia is an invariable participant in the international exhibition movement and was represented at the first World Expo in London in 1851. Well, we will compete with you, we certainly will! Colleagues, We believe that the key factor in Russia's investment appeal is its macroeconomic stability, and we intend to prioritise the effort to ensure this stability both now and in the future. I would like to stress that the global economic crisis caused by the pandemic has affected our country less severely, less strongly than other states. Largely, this was possible thanks to the structural reliability of the Russian economy. According to estimates, the GDP growth, as of the end of last year, will amount to approximately 4.5 percent. Unemployment in Russia has stayed around the historical low of 4.3 percent. I would also like to note that the companies operating in our country actively use the most diverse support mechanisms; they use them because we offer them both to our domestic and foreign partners. The foreign corporations that localised their production facilities in Russia are eligible for additional benefits and tax privileges in the special economic zones and can operate on the basis of special investment contracts. In addition, a preferential treatment for issuing residential permits to foreign investors will come into effect in the middle of this year. Of course, the fact that Russia and the European Union have not yet completed the mutual recognition process for their vaccines and vaccination certificates is not at all conducive to more active business contacts and trips. In this context, I would mention the joint Russian-Italian comparison of vaccines carried out at the Italian National Institute for the Infectious Diseases, which showed that Russia's Sputnik V demonstrated the greatest virus-neutralising titre with respect to the Omicron variant and proved again its high effectiveness. Colleagues, The Russian side is represented at today's meeting by the key economic ministers and CEOs of major domestic companies. Naturally, they will take into account all the problems concerning you and keep in contact with you in order to promote your further successful work in Russia. Let us get down to work, I mean directly to our discussion. I thank you and give the floor to President of the Italian-Russian Chamber of Commerce Mr Vincenzo Trani. And, of course, I want to stress again that members of the Russian Government, my colleagues, and, as I have said, heads of our major companies, which are often your partners, are in contact with us right now. And I will gladly give the floor to them during our discussion, as I did previously, so you will directly hear the opinions of your Russian colleagues regarding the prospects for developing Russian-Italian economic ties. Please, go ahead. President of the Italian-Russian Chamber of Commerce Vincenzo Trani: Good afternoon, Mr President. Thank you very much for the opportunity that the Italian-Russian Chamber of Commerce and I have today. Thank you for responding to our request. I wanted to use today's event to involve major Italian companies, including officials from other associations which, together with the Italian-Russian Chamber of Commerce, are creating the Italian system. I especially wanted to engage the main committee of Italian-Russian entrepreneurs, which is headed by Mr Tronchetti Provera, who is sitting next to me. We organised this event. I am particularly grateful to you because the companies that are here with me now find it important to have this opportunity and engage in a direct dialogue. Of course, this is important not only for them, but for many other companies as well. As you said, almost 500 companies are investing and working in Russia. They really wanted to participate in this meeting, but, unfortunately, were unable to do so. This is why we included two associations on the list of speakers that are working with us, building a dialogue and a bridge between Russia and Italy. These associations are Confindustria and GIM Unimpresa. The Italian-Russian Chamber of Commerce has been in existence for 57 years now. Our goal is to create a dialogue, including during times when things are not going too well. Sometimes, the need for a dialogue is even greater during challenging times. However, the ties that exist between Italy and Russia and between our peoples are even older than our states. Even before the Italian Republic was formed, business between Italians and Russians existed. Relations between Russia and Italy in recent years have been unfolding amid complex international circumstances. We have faced challenging situations and developments many times, and every time we overcome them through dialogue. I think at moments like these a dialogue, especially a dialogue between businesses and between us and businesses, is our main tool. I always tell my fellow entrepreneurs, since I am an entrepreneur myself and became an entrepreneur in Russia, I always tell them that the best investment and, of course, the best businesses are created in times of adversity. I have always used this logic in my business. So, today I support and advise many other entrepreneurs who are looking at Russia as a country of opportunity, to have a good look at Russia's potential, which, in the wake of the global coronavirus crisis, is, of course, ready for a""new renaissance,"" including with regard to Italy. I would like to turn it over to my colleague, Marco Tronchetti Provera, CEO and Executive Vice Chairman of Pirelli and Co-Chairman of the Russian-Italian Committee of Entrepreneurs, who will talk about developing and exploring new opportunities and building a new dialogue. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67642,Greetings to the 9th National Congress of Agricultural Cooperatives,2022-01-26T11:30:00Z,NA,Vladimir Putin sent a message of greetings to the participants and guests of the 9th National Congress of Agricultural Cooperatives.,"The message reads, in part:""For many decades, cooperation has played a big role in the economic life of our country. Consumer and production companies actively participated in the procurement, processing and sales of agrarian products, as well as in commercial and household services in rural areas. Owing to their energy, acumen and responsibility, they have done much for the sustainable socioeconomic development of the regions and the improvement of the living standards of our people. Importantly, today the rich traditions of domestic rural cooperation are receiving another lease of life. The cooperative movement is growing and expanding. It is making a tangible contribution to the efforts to ensure Russia's food safety, strengthen the positions of its small and medium-sized businesses and create new, modern jobs."""
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67635,Meeting with members of Russia's Olympic team,2022-01-25T14:15:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region",The President met with members of Russia's national team ahead of the opening of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, good afternoon. I am happy to see you all, if only on the screen. Seeing off the Russian Olympic team is a good and longstanding tradition, and it is gratifying that, despite the circumstances we are all aware of and the remote formats we have to use, this tradition has not been interrupted. I am well aware how important it is to wish someone good luck before a long journey and serious trials, and for them to hear our wishes as well. It is important for every person, for every one of us. The challenges that you are going to face are more than serious: they are a test of character and willpower, a fight against the strongest athletes on the planet. Very soon, you will be representing our country at the Winter Olympics in Beijing, so, first of all, I wish you to stay in good health, and in good, fighting spirit. My warmest congratulations to all of you on being included in the national team. Also, as you probably know, we are celebrating Tatyana's Day and the Day of Russian Students today, so I wish all the best to head coach Tatyana Borodulina and sleigh rider Tatyana Ivanova on their Saint's Day. And to student athletes, of course– there are a lot of them on our team. Each of you– all those who have joined the Olympic team– must be nervous, of course, thinking about the upcoming competitions– a very important and highly demanding event. We know that you have been aspiring for this for years, going through hard exhausting training, defeats and victories, finally earning the right to show off your skills and your talent at the most important competitions for any athlete. You have proved by deed that you deserve to continue the great traditions of Russian sports. The pandemic situation has greatly changed our usual way of life, of course. But you have managed to overcome these difficulties and temper your character even more, to strengthen your will to win and confidently go through all the stages of qualifications for the Olympics. Many have risen to the top of global rankings. Russian athletes will compete in each of the 13 sports in Beijing, including a number of new Olympic sports. These achievements are largely due to the coaches, specialists who tirelessly work with the teams, to the help of our patrons and members of the Russian Olympians Foundation, and, of course, to the efforts of the Russian regions to create the necessary conditions to ensure high quality training of local athletes. It is an obvious fact that the level of local support for sports directly affects the level of fitness and a healthy lifestyle in the region, and makes it possible to find and support gifted children and train new generations of elite sports representatives. Major international competitions are an excellent driver for promoting sports in society. I believe that their main objective is to involve as many people as possible in sports and strengthen friendship between nations. Our Chinese friends, the organisers of the upcoming Games, share this approach. Together we stand against the politisation of sports and demonstrative boycotts; we support the traditional Olympic values, primarily, equal rights and justice. During the opening of the Games, I will meet with President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping. We will outline new plans for future interaction, including with regard to our agreements on holding the years of Russian-Chinese cooperation in physical fitness and sports. There is every reason to believe that the Games in Beijing will be held at a very high level and will be part of the golden records of the world Olympic family. Just like Russia, China has vast and highly useful experience of organising large-scale international events, and I am sure that our friends will create all the necessary conditions, including for the competition itself, issues related to the participants' stay in China and, of course, measures to safeguard the athletes' and spectators' health. In turn, I ask you and all your teammates to strictly comply with the requirements of the Organising Committee and follow all medical advice. The Russian Government, the Federal Medical-Biological Agency and the Olympic Committee will create the necessary conditions for that. I also want to note that over the past few years, China has been paying a great deal of attention to the development of winter sports. Therefore, in Beijing you will meet not only your traditional rivals from Europe and North America, but also promising Chinese athletes. Competition will definitely make the battle for the Olympic gold even more spectacular, keen and intense. But, as we know, in Russia, we do not fear difficulties, for they make us even stronger, more united and confident. I am sure that you will show all these qualities in Beijing. Here, in Russia, we will be rooting for you. We will be proud of your achievements and hope that you will surpass yourselves at the Games and show a top-notch performance. I wish you luck, good health and a great performance at the Beijing Winter Olympics. Good luck!"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67632,Meeting with university students to mark Russian Students Day,2022-01-25T13:40:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region","On Russian Students Day, Vladimir Putin held a meeting, via videoconference, with students from Moscow, St Petersburg, Novosibirsk and Nizhny Novgorod universities.","Taking part in the event were students majoring in mathematics and IT who won national and international mathematics Olympiads and competitions for school and university students, such as the IMO, the IMC, and the International Collegiate Programming Contest(ICPC).*** Excerpts from transcript of meeting with university students to mark Russian Students Day President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends. Today, in line with an ancient tradition, we mark Tatyana's Day, also known as Russian Students Day. I would like to convey my greetings to undergraduate students, medical residents, post-graduate students, and of course school pupils who are only preparing to enrol at universities. It goes without saying that my greetings also go to well-established adults. After all, the memories of student camaraderie and the marvellous university years stay with us forever. It is not surprising that even many years after graduating, today's researchers, doctors, engineers and specialists in various fields stay friends and meet up with their peers to share memories of the wisdom and advice they received from their professors and mentors. It is thanks to this generational bond that Russia keeps moving forward, achieving scientific and technological breakthroughs, including in mathematics and digital technology. In fact, Russia has built a solid track record in these disciplines and has firmly established itself as a frontrunner. Today, we have here with us students who achieved outstanding results in mathematics by winning national and international competitions. They already undertake research projects, publish scientific articles, and teach mathematics at schools. There is no doubt that hard work and talent enabled you to achieve these outstanding, remarkable results. I am certain that unique mathematics teaching methods developed by Russian physics and mathematics schools over decades played an important part. The effort to build these institutions into an integrated system started back in the Soviet era thanks to such prominent researchers and teachers as Alexandrov, Kolmogorov, Lavrentyev, Ovchinnikov and Petrashen. Russian students are regular winners of physics and mathematics contests thanks to our schools with advanced physics and mathematics programmes. An entire network of these schools was created in the Soviet Union. The victories and triumphs of Russian school and university teams demonstrate that it was the right decision at the time. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you, all your teachers, other tournament participants, coaches and mentors for your results. You have done a great job to achieve these results. Well done! What else can I say? Like all people with a passion and true professionals, I think you understand and know better than anybody else that mathematics is not just an abstract area of science. Mathematics is a science of the future and a tool to develop new technologies and the most advanced industries. This includes Big Data and its use in industrial production, finance, healthcare, genetics and so many other fields. Mathematics is also becoming a reliable helper in humanitarian sciences, including history and linguistics. And, of course, it is based on mathematical methods that modern software and AI solutions are developed. Therefore, it is our principled task to ensure that mathematics and computer science studies are accessible, from an early age, so that any school student could study these subjects at an advanced level if they wish. I would like to add that more than half of state-funded places in universities are distributed among mathematics, natural sciences, engineering, technology and other programmes that involve in-depth studies of mathematics. Of course, we will continue to work on scientific and technological projects, including in cooperation with leading experts from different countries. Therefore, I would like to invite you and your professors and teachers to the International Mathematics Congress to be held in St Petersburg this summer. I would like to conclude my opening remarks by congratulating all Russian undergraduate and postgraduate students on International Students' Day and to wish you success in your studies, research, creative projects, sports and, of course, I wish you to have reliable friends and love. I want to stress that loyalty to the student fellowship is extremely important. Congratulations. <…> Vladimir Putin(on the International Congress of Mathematicians): First, I would like to say that I could not but support the initiative of St Petersburg State University to host this international congress– as an alumnus, former professor and former deputy rector of the then Leningrad State University. This is a great initiative. A similar congress was held in Moscow in 1966, I think. Indeed, now it is St Petersburg's turn. You noted that the purpose of the congress is to stress the importance of mathematics as a science for Russia and the entire world today. In fact, not just to stress its importance but to spark more interest in math, to attract more young and talented people that the country needs for development. We know that math is a backbone science for many industries, from artificial intelligence and Big Data to, oddly enough, humanitarian fields. I just talked about this in my opening remarks: without mathematics, it would be difficult today to process the enormous amount of archive materials, and it would be impossible to digitise many things. Statistics is essential for the humanities. Therefore, as one of our outstanding scientists said, mathematics can be found everywhere. Everything is mathematical to one extent or another. By supporting this initiative to host the International Congress of Mathematicians in Russia, we are pursuing the goal of attracting young and talented people to this field, as I said. I hope the congress will help us resolve this particular problem. In addition, the congress will highlight the role of Russia and our brilliant scientists in the development of mathematics in the world. So let's use our past experience in hosting major international political and sporting events to organise this event to the highest standards. Of course, I do rely on you and your colleagues to participate. For my part, I would be happy to attend and welcome the Russian and foreign participants. But I need to check my schedule first. I will try to arrange that. <…> Vladimir Putin(on choosing between research and a career in the corporate world): You know, no matter where you live, you will earn a better living in the corporate world compared to those who dedicate their lives to public service, military careers, art or science. It has always been this way no matter where you look. Everyone must choose what they want to do in life, where to pursue success and where you can unlock your potential. This is an extremely important decision; in fact, this is what matters the most, I believe. Of course, people can and must be creative in the corporate world, but it is also clear that this is a choice each person must face. That said, you are right: a talented person who achieves good, outstanding results in a certain field can expect to earn a decent living, provide for their family, and it is up to the state to provide the necessary support. This is what we are trying to do. The system of grants for young researchers has been effective, in fact. I will not go through all the available opportunities, but you probably know them. It goes without saying that only creative, productive people can be part of this framework. A meeting we had in Sochi with your colleagues comes to mind. These were participants in a congress for young researchers, and I agree with what they said back then. We will do our best to make sure that people who achieve tangible results in research are the first to get state support. There are also everyday concerns we need to keep in mind at all times. Housing is of course the most important of them all. There are many opportunities here, including housing certificates, subsidised mortgages, as well as employer-rented housing. We will keep working on all these tracks to build a multifaceted framework for supporting young researchers. I think you and I can agree on that. In your remarks, you mentioned remote work. There is no doubt that it is essential that we offer young people an environment in which they can do research and at the same time work for our high-technology companies, eager as they are to recruit people like you. All we need is to find an adequate interface between research and practice. I must say that our high-tech companies have been doing this for some time now and have been dedicated in their efforts. In fact, they were quite successful on this front. They have been creating departments in universities for their future employees. Of course, we need to work even closer with them to ensure that they create an enabling environment so they can achieve better results in their hands-on activities and be more competitive in Russia, as well as globally by leveraging the potential of young promising and interesting people like you. We will work on all these matters. If you have any ideas inspired by your personal experience on ways of arranging all this, please share them with us, and we will definitely take them into consideration when taking decisions on these matters at the Government level. <…> Vladimir Putin(on early career guidance): You raised a very important question. Early career guidance is extremely important because it helps students choose a profession to which they are ready and willing to devote their whole life, and in which they hope to achieve personal success. As I have said many times, and we all understand this, personal success of each individual means success of the country as a whole. This is certainly a very important task. It is necessary, in part, to find mechanisms and methods for this early career guidance. In this context, Olympiads are, of course, very important, as well as follow-up support for their winners. They should be able to understand how the world works, what high tech is and what is more suitable for them: either science and scientific research or practical activities. As I have already said, our companies are quite good at creating their departments at the country's leading universities to train their future specialists. We will certainly continue doing this and will fully support such undertakings of Russian high-tech companies. The same applies to Olympiads. I believe the first one took place in Moscow in 1935. Now there is a whole network of these regular competitions. Our schoolchildren and students take part in international competitions with great success. Last year, they even set a record. I recall they won 31 medals. This had never happened before, even in the entire successful history of our students and schoolchildren participating in international Olympiads. Naturally, this shows that much is being done to prepare specialists at schools and universities. The results of these Olympiads and our successes there are clear evidence of this. We will continue doing this. In effect, you raised an issue that we are already focusing on. We will continue working on it. <…> Vladimir Putin(on developing the Olympiad movement in the regions): You have touched on an important issue. I just covered it myself. Of course, training specialists throughout the country, not in just two or three centres across our vast country, is a critically important task. You mentioned Sirius. You know, the idea to create Sirius came to me based on the fact that– I also mentioned this today– an entire system of physics and mathematics schools was created in Russia, even earlier in the Soviet Union. These schools were a very good basis for training specialists in many areas of natural sciences. But, of course, they needed support. One of the purposes of Sirius is to create a network like this throughout the country in order to support teachers and talented youth. Sirius has already created, I think, over 80 sites in the regions, and another 40-plus should be created by 2024. Regional administrations and regional management teams have a critical role to play in this regard. But I have to say that, overall, we see that our colleagues in the regions are interested in supporting this work and we will incentivise them in every way to do so. You also mentioned other opportunities that– every cloud has a silver lining– the pandemic has brought up, such as online training and advanced training, including for teachers. We will move forward in all these areas, including extended learning centres, associations, groups, and so on. This is how we will work. In fact, you mentioned every area that we need to focus on. We are doing this and will continue to do this in the future. <…> Vladimir Putin: It is impossible to imagine advances in applied science without fundamental science. Of course, state support is critical. The fundamental sciences should be, and I want to assure you, will be the centre of attention on behalf of the state. Once again, happy Students Day and happy Tatyana's Day, and all the best. Best wishes."

In response, the Governor noted that in 2021 industrial output started to recover, which is mostly attributable to fish processing following a very good fishing season. As for construction, Kamchatka has been struggling with this sector for a while now. The territory has finally succeeded in ending the stalemate on the substandard housing issue and has drafted several comprehensive housing development projects. It raised funds for improving the utility infrastructure through infrastructure loans, and is preparing to build a total of 200,000 square metres of housing. The construction of single-family homes is receiving special attention. On the coronavirus, the Governor said that the situation has been quite stable in Kamchatka. The Defence Ministry has done a lot to help the territory by deploying an infectious disease hospital, with military personnel stepping in to help the territory during peak periods. Vladimir Solodov also reported on launching the construction of the Kamchatka Regional Hospital, and asked the President for his support in approving allocations for the construction. The Governor went on to emphasise that improved living standards was a priority for the territory, which managed to prevent a decline in real disposable income during the epidemic. Support measures taken under the President's instructions, as well as the decision to increase the minimum wage played a special role in this regard. Unemployment remained relatively low as well, and fewer young people left the region, which is another positive development. Vladimir Putin said the territory needs to install broadband, and Vladimir Solodov replied by noting that the territory's northern areas will benefit from internet connection as soon as 2023, although the northernmost districts, as well as the Komandorskiye Islands will still have to rely on satellite communications. The Governor pointed out that when asked what they need the most, young people in the northern villages ranked internet first, followed by quicker postal deliveries. The territory intends to carry out a pilot project on using drones for this purpose. The Governor spoke about the construction of new facilities, in particular, sport centres. One unique facility has already been completed and will open soon– a year-round winter sports centre, where athletes will be able to train right on the Avachinsky volcano, including in summer. This first major ice arena in Kamchatka has been built with private money. Vladimir Solodov brought up a problem that is common for most regions in the Far East. It has to do with the normative level of the federal government's co-financing of the national projects in the Far Eastern regions. In particular, according to him, standard projects do not objectively take into account the higher construction costs in regions such as Kamchatka. The President suggested that the Governor should formulate the relevant proposals in writing and send them to him in order to instruct the Government to work on this. The Governor also raised a number of questions that are very important for Kamchatka Territory. They concern a fair indexation of fees on aquatic biological resources, investment quotas for the construction of fishing vessels and so on. Vladimir Solodov stressed that the region expected a tangible effect from the Northern Sea Route. Novatek is already implementing the first project for the shipment of liquefied natural gas. Kamchatka is a convenient transshipment point in the east of the country. The President and the Governor also discussed the construction of roads and air transport, especially in the region. In this regard, the Governor asked for federal subsidies to partially finance such non-alternative routes, as the regional government cannot afford this. The President also asked him to prepare relevant proposals. The discussion predictably covered tourism, which Vladimir Solodov called the most promising industry. He said Kamchatka was known to the whole world. At present, work is underway in the Valley of Geysers. The region has seen a 60 percent increase in tourist inflow. New tourist facilities are being added. One of them is a falconry centre. Its first stage has already been completed, and the first batch of birds is going to be delivered soon. The Governor also said that the region was going to host the Ecosystem Nationwide Youth Forum in August, before the Eastern Economic Forum. It will be the first carbon-neutral forum, innovative in many ways. Mr Solodov invited the President to attend it. Vladimir Putin thanked him for the invitation and said he had not been to Kamchatka for a long time and would be glad to come."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67618,Meeting with permanent members of the Security Council,2022-01-21T14:30:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow","Vladimir Putin held a meeting, via videoconference, with permanent members of the Security Council.","The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matviyenko, State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin, Deputy Chairman of the Security Council Dmitry Medvedev, Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Anton Vaino, Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev, Director of the Foreign Intelligence Service Sergei Naryshkin, Special Presidential Representative for Environmental Protection, Ecology and Transport Sergei Ivanov, as well as Acting Minister for Civil Defence, Emergencies and Natural Disaster Relief Alexander Chupriyan. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues. Today we will discuss additional measures to improve fire safety and reduce the risk of emergencies and disasters during the high-water season. Everything must be done in good time, so these will be the main items on our agenda today. But before we get down to work, I would like to highlight another important topic that matters to millions of our citizens. I am referring to pensions. Only recently, we took a decision to raise pensions by adjusting them for inflation for civilian retirees. This came up during the United Russia party congress, as well as at my recent news conference. This is a question of ensuring the wellbeing and preserving the incomes of our senior generation. As I have already said, we took a decision on civilian retirees to increase their pensions, starting from January 1, by 8.6 percent, which is above last year's inflation rate. Of course, we must not forget about those who retired from the military. I believe that we need to follow the same approach for military retirees and those with a similar status. I am referring to the retired employees of the Interior Ministry, the National Guard, the Ministry of Civil Defence, Emergencies and Natural Disaster Relief, the Prosecutor General's Office, the Investigative Committee, and other structures. Overall, this is about 2.6 million people. As you know, the initial plan was to adjust military pensions for inflation on October 1, 2022, with a 4 percent increase. This is clearly below the actual inflation rate. Moreover, these people would have had to wait for this increase for too long. Instead, I suggest that we take the following decision: to adjust pensions for those retiring from the military and those with a similar status from January 1, 2022, by 8.6 percent, like for all other retirees, instead of 4 percent. Let me reiterate that this exceeds the actual inflation rate. I am asking the Government to carry out this decision without delay, including by reassessing pensions that have already been paid for the month of January so that people receive the money they are owed with the next monthly pension. Let us now move on to today's agenda. <…>"

Vladimir Putin informed Sauli Niinist ö about Russia's fundamental approaches in great detail, noting that Moscow was expecting a specific, in-depth written response to draft documents on providing legally binding security guarantees to the Russian Federation, as promised by its partners. The importance of complying with the principle of indivisible security, formalised by basic OSCE documents, was noted. While discussing prospects for resolving the intra-Ukrainian crisis, both parties reaffirmed the importance of consistently and fully implementing the 2015 Minsk Package of Measures, the only basic document for resolving the crisis. The President of Russia noted that Kiev still refused to fulfil its obligations under the Minsk Agreements, including launching direct dialogue with Donetsk and Lugansk and formalising the special status of Donbass in the constitution. The leaders exchanged congratulations on the 30th anniversary of signing the Russian-Finnish Treaty on the Basis for Relations that ushered in a new stage of Russian-Finnish interaction."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67613,Meeting with Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin,2022-01-20T13:00:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin held a working meeting with Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin.,"Sergei Sobyanin briefed the President on the capital's social and economic affairs and transport infrastructure development, and made an in-depth report on the situation in Moscow amid the new wave of the coronavirus caused by the new Omicron strain. The Moscow Mayor reported on the city's healthcare system performance and the measures taken to prepare for peak loads.*** Vladimir Putin: Mr Sobyanin, we remain in touch and always work together, both on the phone and in person during meetings. I suggest that we discuss the overall situation in the capital. What is your assessment? What are the short-term objectives? Sergei Sobyanin Sobyanin SergeiMoscow Mayor: Mr Putin, as you may be aware, there have been quite a few pessimistic forecasts regarding the pandemic alleging that the economy would fail to cope with these challenges, leading to serious socioeconomic problems, etc. However, judging by preliminary annual performance data, the economy has been coping with these challenges rather well and adapted to the new environment we have to work in. In fact, we have improved our results not only compared to 2020 with all its challenges, but even compared to 2019 as the reference year. There was quite a substantial increase in several indicators: investment was up 12 percent, construction added 23 percent, and industrial output increased by 28 percent. It is obvious that these are not mere fluctuations but real growth of the city's economy. Of course, the situation becomes more complicated once we turn to public catering, trade, and services. Trade increased dramatically, including the retail sector. Experts tell us that this may be due, in part, to the fact that many Russians did not travel to Europe and had to shop at shopping centres and shops at home, generating substantial revenue here, while they used to spend this money in Europe. This can be viewed as a positive development. Even the hotel business gained momentum. In 2020, we feared that it would not be able to withstand this blow, but already in 2021, this sector recovered to the level of 2019. Domestic tourism recovered as more people came from other regions, which offset losses, to an extent. We carried out the census. The preliminary data we have indicate that over the past 10 years Moscow's population grew by 1,5 million people, approaching 13 million or even more. The count has yet to be finalised, but it is already clear that the final figure will be around 13 million. One and a half million people is a big number. It was not our intention to attract more people, but for several decades now Moscow's population has been growing by about a million people every ten years. This is a real trend, and all major cities experience this. New Moscow territories contributed another 500,000 people to the total population, which gives us the figure of 1,5 million. Of course, this creates new challenges for Moscow in terms of its social infrastructure: kindergartens, schools, hospitals, and clinics, without forgetting transport. Transport is essential, of course. Thank you very much for your decision to approve an infrastructure loan. We are using the money to buy new metro carriages and new trains for the suburban service, for Moscow Central Diameters(MCD). Pursuant to your decision, the National Wealth Fund has allocated additional resources to Russian Railways for them to invest in the Central Transportation Hub. This has made it possible to develop it dynamically. Apart from the Moscow Central Diameters that we have launched, we are continuing with the construction of MCD-3 and MCD-4. Hopefully, these projects will be launched in 2023–2024. You and I opened 10 metro stations, a unique occurrence in Moscow's history. Never before have so many stations been launched at once. We hope to link up this ring in 2022 and the world's biggest metro ring will become fully functional in late 2023 to early 2024. These projects should, of course, solve many transport problems, although we are still building nearly 100 kilometres of roads and transport junctions. Between 2020 and 2021, without reducing the pace of our construction, we built about 100 kilometres of roads, junctions, tunnels, overhead roads, and so on. This is a lot of work. I would like to thank you for your trust, Mr Putin, in supporting our bid to host the Expo 2030. It was a complicated decision, because our country has long been involved in this exhibition movement, but… Vladimir Putin: We have never hosted a single exhibition of this scale. Sergei Sobyanin: We have never won a bid. There is much rivalry from Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Italy with Rome, and even Ukraine. But we will fight. We have a lot of experience in preparing for the Olympic Games, and the World Cup, which was held in Moscow and other cities. The feedback has been highly positive. Moscow's infrastructure is ready. My colleagues and I have determined the approximate location of the future Expo grounds. This is in the vicinity of Vnukovo Airport. We decided against holding it in the city. Firstly, the city lacks free space of the required size. Secondly, holding exhibitions of this kind is always stressful for residents. We have located it as close as possible to Vnukovo. In Vnukovo, we have a metro service, the Moscow metro service, and the Moscow Central Diameter, and Kiev Highway. Vladimir Putin: And the airport. Sergei Sobyanin: Yes, the airport is within reach. It will be the most comfortable arrangement in terms of infrastructure. Apart from that, it will create a powerful job cluster to help the development of the entire area. So, we intend to fight for it. <…>"

We have been in constant contact since your inauguration, but of course, videoconferences and telephone conversations cannot replace personal meetings. I would like to note that despite the pandemic we increased trade even the year before last. This increase was not big – over 6 percent, but it was still an increase. Last year, our trade grew by more than 38 percent. We are carrying out our major projects in many areas. We closely cooperate in the international arena. We can say that our efforts largely helped the Syrian government overcome the threats linked with international terrorism. Now both you and we are concerned about the situation that is taking shape in Afghanistan. I would like to discuss all these issues with you and hear your position on these problems. Iran and the Eurasian Economic Union(EAEU) are developing relations on a temporary basis, under a temporary agreement. We are doing much to create a long-term foundation for cooperation and a free trade area between Iran and our union. Iran plays a major role as an observer in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation(SCO) as well. Finally, it is very important for me to know your position on the JCPOA. In other words, we have a very extensive agenda. I am happy to see you. As we begin our meeting, I would like to ask you to convey my very best wishes to your spiritual leader – Mr Khamenei. Welcome. President of Iran Sayyid Ebrahim Raisi Raisi Sayyid EbrahimPresident of Iran (retranslated): Thank you very much. In the name of Rahman, I would like to thank you sincerely, Your Excellency, for inviting me to Moscow. I am very happy to have this meeting with you today. Your Excellency, I would like to thank you for supporting the Islamic Republic of Iran in becoming a full member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. In foreign policy, the will of the Islamic Republic of Iran is in cooperation, full cooperation with countries, neighbouring countries in particular. As for relations with the friendly Russian Federation, we want these relations to be sustainable and comprehensive. We can develop our relations in the economy, trade, politics, culture and all other areas that benefit our two countries and our two peoples. So, we can develop and expand bilateral cooperation in all of these areas. We in the Islamic Republic of Iran have no restrictions on developing and expanding ties with friendly Russia and these ties will become strategic. Therefore, these relations will not be short-term or situational – they will be permanent and strategic. I would like to say that in the current, exceptional conditions when unilateral actions by the West, including the US are being confronted, we can create synergy in our cooperation. We have opposed the Americans for over 40 years and we will never stop progress and national development because of sanctions or threats. We are of course trying to have these sanctions lifted. We are working on different mechanisms, and our ultimate goal is to remove restrictions with their help. We have had very good experience in cooperating with the Russian Federation in Syria. We were fighting terrorism in the region, in the Syrian Arab Republic through a concerted effort. We can use this positive experience in many other areas. We have a document on bilateral strategic cooperation, which may determine our future relations for the next 20 years. At any rate, it can explain our prospects. This is why we have given this document to our Russian colleagues. We believe this document will certainly determine the long-term prospects for strategic cooperation between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Russian Federation. We are not content with our trade and economic ties in the current situation. Of course, we can increase the level of trade and economic cooperation several times over, including investment in trade and in the economy. We are working to raise the level of our cooperation in trade and the economy and to raise investment manifold. I would like to say I hope that the agreements made by our colleagues during this visit will be developed further. I know that with your positive view of our cooperation you, Your Excellency, can help translate these agreements into reality. On my part, I intend to instruct my colleagues in the Islamic Republic of Iran to focus on developing practical cooperation that should produce the desired results. Since I have been the head of our Government, I have been monitoring our plan to upgrade our diplomatic ties. Of course, we are working with the Russian Federation and its Foreign Ministry. Our colleagues are cooperating. They welcome this event, and I believe there are no barriers to constructive and mutually beneficial cooperation. We also cooperate in regional organisations, such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the Eurasian Economic Union. Our ties are very deep. I think we can deepen them even further and take productive steps to promote our cooperation in this regard. In think that in these conditions we can launch new cooperation in the economy, politics, culture, science, technology, the defence and military areas, security, and aviation and space, to name a few. We can develop a new level of cooperation in all these areas. I would like to convey to Your Excellency best regards on behalf of the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Imam Khamenei. He also lays emphasis on the development and expansion of bilateral ties and the synergy that we can create together. I am at your service. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. You have a very extensive programme for your stay in Russia, many meetings and speeches. But we are not in any hurry today. We are not in a rush and we will have time to discuss all these issues in comfort. Then we will have lunch and can talk in a more relaxed atmosphere. Thank you. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67604,Meeting with Minister of Culture Olga Lyubimova,2022-01-18T13:30:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with Minister of Culture Olga Lyubimova,"Olga Lyubimova told the President about the progress of the Culture national project and the Pushkin Card programme. She also talked about the development of domestic restoration schools, a nationwide plan for guest performances and music competitions held in Russia.*** President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Shall we begin with the restoration of cultural landmarks? Minister of Culture Olga Lyubimova Lyubimova OlgaMinister of Culture: Certainly. This is one of our most important and difficult areas because it was in crisis for many years. We are working in restoration not only with cultural landmarks but also with film at Gosfilmofond(State Film Archive). We are short of specialists who can restore musical instruments, and we do have unique violins by Guarneri, Amati and Stradivari. Fantastic performers play these violins. We are starting from scratch to train these specialists at the Gnessin State Musical College. We want to acquire masters will be able to restore musical instruments here, in Russia, so that we do not have to take them to Cremona every time. Of course, there are also museum pieces. We are very happy to see that this work is in full swing at the State Historical Museum. A separate area is the revival of the Leningrad restoration school in Peterhof and at Tsarskoye Selo. We are establishing large centres of competence in different areas of restoration. Our cooperation with them is good and smooth in both design and appraisal. Plus, I must say that we have acquired a whole army of volunteers that are helping us. We can see how well they work in reserve museums, helping specialists conserve buildings that we are planning to restore later. Another area of our activity that I would like to describe is our nationwide plan of guest performances. There was a tradition in the Soviet Union to draft a national programme for guest performances. We have revived this at Rosconcert. Obviously, most companies are doing guest performances– in Moscow, St Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Crimea, especially in the summer. Of course, this is a big area– 85 regions for 32 national companies. These photos show how the Lezginka dance company performs in Chelyabinsk or the Pyatnisky Choir in Blagoveshchensk. This is a very important tradition that we have always had and, of course, the public reaction to these performances is incredible. I will talk about the Pushkin Card a bit later. We understand of course that young people who live in different regions and municipalities should be able to see groups of different levels. Regarding our performers again, I would like to thank you very much for the start of the biggest Rachmaninoff competition timed to his 150th birthday. You know, it reminds us of the summer and winter Olympics. Since 1958, we have held the Tchaikovsky competition once every four years. We feel this is too rare. Now we have an interval of two years[with the Rachmaninoff competition]. Valery Gergiev and Denis Matsuev are there, involving their younger colleagues: 500 participants, 35 countries and three categories in which Sergei Rachmaninoff was so renowned– piano, conducting and of course composition. Indeed, there is very little talk about young modern composers. And as a result, we will see unique young performers. First of all, they will perform more together with the Mariinsky Theatre, with Novaya Rossiya[the New Russia], and with the Svetlanov[State Academic Symphony] Orchestra. Vladimir Putin: Over 500 participants, right? Olga Lyubimova: Yes. And applications. Since the Tchaikovsky competition is highly respected in the world… the newly established Rachmaninoff competition will give them a start, an opportunity to prove their worth more often than once every four years. Now, regarding our Culture national project. We are in our third year on this project. In addition to the box office performances, it is very important for us to report that our well-coordinated work with the regions really produces golden projects. We do not have any projects that the governors have to be persuaded to work with. I am referring to cultural centres, to children's art schools, children's theatres, cinemas, and virtual concert halls. Car clubs literally saved us during the pandemic by giving us a chance to come and let people enjoy an open-air holiday. And new musical instruments, of course, 38,000 of them. We know that teachers have worked at children's art schools for years and nothing has ever changed, and suddenly it is such a big day. Vladimir Putin: I have seen how people react to this. Olga Lyubimova: I would like to tell you specifically about two projects. Model libraries are one of our outstanding and favourite achievements. We are telling you today that 611 libraries have been established in Russia, and 142 libraries have been established by the regions themselves, because they saw how people reacted. They are such powerful places; we are attracting all the young people there– they attend extracurricular activities and classes. We want to add classes in Russian language and literacy, something that is sorely lacking. Local history and lore museums are a new project for us. We have allocated the funds following your Address to the Federal Assembly. Even now, as you can see, 73 regions and 434 museums immediately joined this initiative. It would certainly be a good idea to reformat them, to make them more advanced, so that in addition to the""know, love and respect your land"" message, they would use multimedia– children would enjoy that and people who have been working there for years would enjoy it too. I would like to tell you about our filmmakers. This is a very young industry. These young people have been working with us since 2006, and their works have enjoyed incredible success[at festivals] in Cannes, and in Venice, Beijing, Jerusalem, San Sebastian, Locarno, and Rotterdam. I am referring to young teams of producers who have grown and learned to defend their right to represent national cinema in the international arena– as has always been the case with Tarkovsky, Konchalovsky, Nikita Mikhalkov… and now it is very important, it is difficult for them, geopolitically, they have to fight, just like our athletes, and they win fair and square due to the quality of what they do and participate in all conferences. This is on the one hand. On the other hand, I can tell you about our achievements on large international internet platforms. Festivals present independent films whereas here we can release blockbusters and thanks to""digital"" we can see the therapeutic effect a film can have. The film Silver Skates was released and is at the top in Mexico and all over Latin America. People write and say they want the pandemic to end so they can go to St Petersburg in the winter. They want to see this city because it is beautifully filmed. The film is set in the beginning of the 20th century before the 1905[revolution] and shows the city's beautiful carnivals, traditions and the great palaces in St Petersburg. And, importantly, cinema promotes tourism as a kind of soft power. Vladimir Putin: A sort of synergy. Olga Lyubimova: Yes. And we feel very proud of our studios. Vladimir Putin: How are things with Lenfilm Studios? Olga Lyubimova: The situation with Lenfilm is getting increasingly better. Really. And we, actually not us, but the team working there, is doing a lot of work. We have support for three new films, our""golden collection"" is back at Lenfilm Studios, which will help it. We have brought all the masters together. We are generally set to use it as a single space where young people can come, get additional education and watch films. Vladimir Putin: What about the financial side of the issue–debt, etc.? Olga Lyubimova: The non-core assets have been sold off. Now we have funds to restore the studio, bring it to order and renovate it. Its sound stages are all leased till the end of the year, and Russian film producers are queuing up for more. Vladimir Putin: Is everything functioning all right? Olga Lyubimova: Everything is functioning, the work is going well. There is a competition for the sound stages. I get phone calls from producers who ask about getting involved in this. And briefly, the situation is the same at Gorky Studios and Sverdlovsk Studios where we are reviving Ural Cinema. The people who gained recognition and appreciation in Moscow are going back home as big-name filmmakers and will work to bring Ural Cinema back to life. Vladimir Putin: What about Gorky Studios as the studio that makes films for children and young people? Olga Lyubimova: Gorky Studios have also gained support, we have four new projects. We are also steadily renovating all the sound stages since they are all operating to capacity. We are trying to use it more for film production than TV. In addition, we have a children's school there with VGIK[the National State Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography] nearby, and we also have filmmaking classes for students there. Vladimir Putin: What about the Pushkin Card. Does it work? Olga Lyubimova: The Pushkin Card has been a challenge for all of us. We are very grateful to you because it is indeed a very technical procedure and such a challenge for all our cultural facilities. We are working hard with the expert councils that the regions proposed, and we also review it at the federal expert council level because the card must have an educational and enlightening component. Vladimir Putin: Do people visit mostly their regional culture facilities or do they move around? Olga Lyubimova: They manage to do it during holidays. I reported that the first ticket to a show at the Moscow Academic Theatre of Satire was bought by a girl from Siberia. Obviously, she came with her family to see it. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67598,Meeting with Astrakhan Region Governor Igor Babushkin,2022-01-17T13:40:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow","Vladimir Putin held a working meeting with Governor of the Astrakhan Region Igor Babushkin. The Governor informed the President about the socioeconomic situation in the region. The discussion focused, among other things, on the situation in the healthcare system and shipbuilding.","Igor Babushkin began his report with issues related to combatting COVID-19. At present, almost 100 percent of employees in the social sector, healthcare, culture, education, public catering and housing and utilities have been vaccinated. The authorities have organised home visits by medical workers to increase the level of vaccination among elderly people who are given the opportunity to get a jab at home. According to the Governor, all medical facilities in the Astrakhan Region have the necessary personal protection gear, medications and oxygen. QR-codes are required in the region for visits to shopping malls, cafés and restaurants, and for participating in cultural and mass events. However, they are not needed in public transport, pharmacies and grocery stores. The Governor thanked the President particularly for his decision to use the military to build two fully equipped anti-COVID hospitals in the region. This allowed these two hospitals to treat coronavirus patients during the second wave of the pandemic, while regional hospitals provided only planned medical care to patients. Despite the coronavirus restrictions, the Astrakhan Region continues its cooperation with its Caspian neighbours, noted Mr Babushkin. They are very interested in Caspian cruises to Astrakhan, Atyrau, Turkmenbashi and Baku. In addition to cruises, Caspian countries, including, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan are interested in placing orders at the Astrakhan Region's shipyards. In this context, the Governor thanked Vladimir Putin for his help in stabilising the situation at the Krasnye Barrikady (Red Barricades) shipyard. Now it is working at full capacity. Its portfolio of orders is worth 9 billion rubles. The total portfolio of the Astrakhan Region's shipbuilding companies amounts to 50 billion rubles, said the Governor. Special attention is devoted to developing the International North-South Transport Corridor. Caspian states neighbouring on the Astrakhan Region are also interested in this. To develop this corridor, it is necessary to equip the port of Olya and to saturate it with freight traffic. For these purposes, a container terminal is being built at the port of Olya. The second task to be completed to organise full-value goods traffic has to do with deepening the Volga-Caspian Sea canal. Its depth should be increased to 4.5 metres, as stipulated by the canal's certificate, the Governor noted. While discussing the road sector, Igor Babushkin reported that the construction of Astrakhan's eastern bypass motorway had resumed and also noted that the length of another bypass – northern – would be about 20 kilometres. The sector faces a number of problems, including rundown and dilapidated bridges: 160 out of the 313 local bridge structures are in a critical or pre-emergency condition, the Governor added. The Governor also informed the President that the regional authorities intend to transfer a number of the Astrakhan Region's strategic motorways under federal jurisdiction. They include a route for accessing the port of Olya, another road linking the region with the Karauzek checkpoint on the border with Kazakhstan and the Astrakhan-Volgograd route. The President drew the Governor's attention to the problem of dilapidated housing and inquired about the efforts to relocate residents of these houses. The relocation programme, which was formulated before January 1, 2017, and includes 38,000 square metres of housing, is being implemented ahead of schedule, the Governor noted. There are plans to complete the programme by late 2022, he added. In 2019, authorities recorded an additional 698 buildings with an area of 250,000 square metres whose residents should also be relocated. The buildings will be listed in a new programme for relocating residents of dilapidated housing. Vladimir Putin noted once again that it was necessary to prioritise this aspect. In conclusion of the working meeting, the Governor asked the President, on behalf of Astrakhan veterans, to award Astrakhan the title of City of Labour Valour, so as to perpetuate the memory of home front workers' heroic feat during the Great Patriotic War. Vladimir Putin supported this initiative."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67591,Meeting with Perm Territory Governor Dmitry Makhonin,2022-01-14T14:10:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow","Vladimir Putin met with Governor of Perm Territory Dmitry Makhonin, who reported on the socioeconomic situation in the region.","At the beginning of the meeting, the President asked about developments on the labour market and about resettling those in dilapidated and emergency housing. Vladimir Putin had instructed Dmitry Makhonin to pay special attention to these issues at the previous meeting. The Perm Territory Governor reported that the region was one of the first in Russia to reach pre-pandemic levels of unemployment. A large programme to resettle those in dilapidated and emergency housing is underway, carried out not only as part of the federal project, but also as a regional programme. In addition, the rate of housing construction is increasing. According to the Governor, the opening of a greenhouse complex to grow vegetables almost completely covers the territory's needs and was a landmark event. Development prospects for the Berezniki-Solikamsk area, with a population of about 300,000, were discussed; in particular, the construction of a residential area to relocate people whose housing was found unfit for habitation due to a man-made accident. According to the governor, the territory has developed a programme to restore architectural landmarks, for example, Usolye Stroganovskoye: the project to gentrify this historical and architectural museum reserve won a nationwide contest on creating a comfortable environment in towns and historical settlements. Dmitry Makhonin noted that Perm will be celebrating its 300th anniversary in 2023 and invited the head of state to visit the city. The Governor said Perm is planning several large programmes covering all areas of life in the run-up to its anniversary. Specifically, plans include a new infectious disease hospital, children's outpatient clinics, a rehabilitation centre for disabled children, and an oncological centre. Daycare centres and schools are being built, and there are plans for an international education campus for medical students to take in 5,000 people. Also, the Shvetsov Aviation Technical School is being renovated. Goals in the area of culture include construction of the Perm Art Gallery and a music school for gifted children for 350 pupils. The transport infrastructure is being developed, and new rolling-stock is being purchased. To mark the city's 300th anniversary, 140 buildings will have their facades repaired, and 80 cultural heritage sites will be restored. Embankments on the Kama River and other smaller rivers will be improved. In addition, the Governor touched on engine manufacturing issues because the territory has been entrusted with the project to produce the PD-14 aircraft engine, and the new PD-35 engine is also being developed. He said the region has to create the necessary personnel reserve to supply Rostec enterprises with young engineers. In conclusion, Dmitry Makhonin mentioned sports infrastructure development. In particular, the regional head dwelled on the construction of a multifunctional sports arena with 10,500 seats in Perm, which should be able to bid on major sports competitions. He said Perm had submitted a bid to host the European men's basketball competition in 2025. The Governor also asked the President to support the initiative to hold the Russia – Country of Sports international forum in 2023 in Russia, and the President agreed."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67586,Meeting with Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu,2022-01-13T15:50:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",The President had a working meeting with Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Shoigu, please. I would like you to report on the progress and completion of our peacekeeping mission, our participation in the CSTO peacekeeping mission. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu Shoigu SergeiDefence Minister : Mr President, in keeping with the decision of the Collective Security Council and the presidents and heads of state and government of the CSTO member states, we immediately began the planning and implementation of the operation to form and deploy CSTO peacekeeping troops. Our General Staff is keeping in touch with our colleagues from Kazakhstan, of course, as well as with all the other defence ministers. We have organised an airlift. It involved over 80 military transport aircraft, because we needed to airlift peacekeepers from all the CSTO member states, including Belarus, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, as well as Russian military personnel and their equipment. Vladimir Putin: From Armenia. Sergei Shoigu: Yes, certainly, from Armenia. Armenia as the current chair of the CSTO was to play the main role in preparing what I can describe as documented decisions. All this has been done. We began the operation on schedule and airlifted all the troops very quickly. We assumed control of 14 facilities, which are now of paramount importance, of course. They are communication, energy and life support facilities and facilities vital for the activities of the state. Acting at the request of the Kazakhstani authorities and in accordance with your instructions, we have also placed several other facilities, which could pose a serious threat if seized by terrorists, under our protection. We have established a sustainable command system and a headquarters. The officer who has been appointed commander of the forces on the ground is Colonel General [Andrei] Serdyukov, Commander of the Russian Airborne Forces. He assumed office immediately. We did everything in accordance with our training during drills, sending in the lead group, deploying the forward-based forces and taking over control of the infrastructure necessary for the airlift operation and our activities. Today we held a meeting of the CSTO Council of Defence Ministers where we reviewed a plan and made a decision to transfer various facilities for protection by Kazakhstan's security agencies. It was impossible to do this before because our goal was different in the first days – to release those agencies from protecting the facilities. The quick pace of this operation allowed us to release about 1,600 security officers to fight the criminals who brought chaos to the republic. I would like to repeat that as of today, everything is under control, and our coordination is excellent. We endorsed a plan for the step by step withdrawal and transfer of these facilities for protection to Kazakhstan. We will begin our withdrawal today. Tomorrow, we will airlift the forces of all our colleagues – Armenia, Tajikistan and Belarus – with 14 aircraft. Our Kyrgyz partners will withdraw on their own since they are close. In the next five days, as we will be transferring the facilities, we plan to withdraw the remaining peacekeeping forces and complete everything on January 19. Vladimir Putin: Mr Shoigu, CSTO peacekeepers have played a very important role in stabilising the situation in Kazakhstan, our closest partner and ally. President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev made this evaluation himself. Indeed, we managed to take all vital structures and infrastructure facilities under our protection and release a considerable number of service personnel and law enforcement units to carry out special operations inside the country. As I said, the groups who protested for a reduction in energy prices and the armed groups who fought the armed forces for several days, encircling them in their places of deployment, are completely different groups with different goals. It is very important that the CSTO forces have helped bring the situation back to normal and restore law and order. In fact, this is the first CSTO operation like this. We performed a very important task through a concerted effort. This will allow the leadership of the Republic of Kazakhstan to resolve socioeconomic and political problems in a dialogue with society in a calm atmosphere. This is very important. Our military aviation transport played a big role in this respect; this is clear. We managed to deploy and concentrate our military equipment and personnel, our resources, in a short span of time. Everything went like clockwork: quickly, smoothly and efficiently. I would like to thank you, the General Staff, all those who were in charge of the operation for this work and to express the hope that this practice of using our armed forces will be carefully analysed and improved accordingly, if necessary. Now it is time to go home – we have fulfilled our mission. Thank you. Sergei Shoigu: Thank you, Mr President."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67582,Meeting with Uralchem CEO Dmitry Mazepin,2022-01-13T13:00:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with CEO of JSC United Chemical Company Uralchem Dmitry Mazepin.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Mazepin, good afternoon. I know that you and your company are implementing an extensive social programme in the regions where you operate. Could start with that? Uralchem CEO Dmitry Mazepin: Mr President, thank you very much for the opportunity to meet in person during such a difficult pandemic period. I would like to say a few words about the company. Uralchem employs about 30,000 people. Of these, 60 percent have been vaccinated and 20 percent have recently recovered from COVID-19, so doctors have recommended that they postpone vaccination. The company is operating steadily, and there are no problems. We know how to prevent them and how to tackle them, if necessary. Along with our focus on public health, we also undertake as much social responsibility as we can handle and participate in many social projects. For example, we have signed an agreement with the government of the Perm Territory and the Berezniki city administration on relocation of employees and residents from dilapidated housing in the area where an industrial accident occurred 15 years ago. Vladimir Putin: Sinkholes, right? Dmitry Mazepin: Well, no new sinkholes, and the soil has stabilised. But the exclusion zone is still in place. We have allocated 4.2 billion rubles to build an entire new neighbourhood, Lyubimov. The other districts have been revived, and the city is growing. The company has also allocated 3.7 billion rubles over the past two years for the creation of social infrastructure. A clinic, a preschool centre, a sports and recreation centre, and an indoor skating rink have been built. We have completed financing for a major church. We are also building housing for our employees; we have spent about 3 billion rubles to build 730 flats. This summer, we bought 300 flats in the Kirov Region and donated them to social workers. The company also participates in the large federal project Sirius. We have allocated over 3 billion rubles to build a concert hall. Vladimir Putin: A theatre. Is the construction progressing? Dmitry Mazepin: Yes, it is. Work is underway, there will be a huge building near the Formula 1 track. It is a big project that will be very useful to the Sirius Foundation. If I may, I would like to report briefly on the company's performance results. As I have said, the company's performance is stable, and we are leading the way in mineral fertiliser production. We have every reason to be confident that the company will develop because we believe, the Earth's population will increase by two billion in the next two or three decades. Global per capita plowland areas will dwindle. It may be strange, but these arable lands continue to expand in Russia, due to changing temperatures. A decade ago, our fertiliser deliveries to Tatarstan, the Kirov Region, Udmurtia and the Perm Territory were not very impressive. To be honest, we have now tripled these volumes. And we have learned to cultivate these lands, with the climate helping us. Therefore we believe that the national agriculture sector will grow, and, of course, it is achieving impressive results. China, Brazil, the United States, Europe and India consume the bulk of potassium. I would like to note that, as you know, Africa is unable to buy fertiliser because of skyrocketing prices. And we predict that there will be certain demographic problems. Vladimir Putin: Food problems, in the first place. Dmitry Mazepin: Food problems. We are interested in working in Africa, but they have no capabilities. Industrial countries either subsidise or shut down their markets. Therefore you have made the right decision by instructing us to closely monitor domestic deliveries. Vladimir Putin: Are European partners also downsizing production? I mean your partners. Dmitry Mazepin: We have virtually no partners in the potassium sector; this concerns nitrogen fertiliser. Regarding potassium, you will see potassium sales if we go to the next page. These are global potassium producers. Two Canadian companies control 30 percent of the market, Russia and Belarus control 18 percent each, and China does not operate on foreign markets. Vladimir Putin: They consume everything at home. Dmitry Mazepin: And they also buy the same amounts. They consume 16 million and produce eight million. Vladimir Putin: More than everybody else. Dmitry Mazepin: Yes. We sell potassium to 76 countries. These huge deliveries require a solution to logistics problems. I have a separate report on how we have implemented your instruction to freeze prices. We have voluntarily fixed the prices in May 2021. As for potassium, the Government has no grievances, and potassium is not on the list of quota-controlled mineral fertilisers, because I have promised the heads of ministries, and I am keeping my promise. There were certain breakdowns and lapses involving nitrogen and phosphorus fertiliser, and therefore the Government decided to introduce quotas. This is why the situation is stable now, and these charts show that we provide our agriculturists with fertiliser at a third of the price. Vladimir Putin: Our aim is not to prevent the domestic fertiliser producers from benefitting from the market situation, but to provide our own market with the necessary amount of fertiliser for agriculture. I think that both objectives are reachable, although at first sight it seems that they are mutually exclusive. Nevertheless, our companies will be able to profit from the situation and make decent gains. But in the first place, of course, they should meet the needs of the domestic market. Dmitry Mazepin: Mr President, you are absolutely right. As a company, we have increased the supply of nitrogen fertiliser to the domestic market by 20 percent over the last two years. Five years from now, we will celebrate the 100th anniversary of the start of potassium mining. So, we are the oldest company. As I said, Uralkali employs 21,000 personnel. We are based in Berezniki and Solikamsk. The only thing I would like to draw your attention to is that we continue to deal with an old local problem, because there are about 40,000 kilometres of tunnels under Berezniki and Solikamsk. When the construction began, it was under villages that later gave rise to towns. Therefore, we are tackling all these issues jointly with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment and the Ministry of Industry and Trade. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67579,Meeting to mark the 300th anniversary of the prosecutor's office in Russia,2022-01-12T12:55:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin took part in the ceremonial meeting marking the 300th anniversary of the prosecutor's office in Russia.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Krasnov, colleagues, friends, current workers and veterans of the prosecutor's office, Today we are celebrating a major historical event, the 300th anniversary of the creation of the prosecutor's office in Russia. I congratulate you on reaching such a significant milestone and wish you all the best on your professional holiday. I would like to extend the kindest words to everyone who views serving the law and the Fatherland as a matter of life and destiny, everyone who continues to serve people on this holiday, to respond to violations of law and order, to participate in court hearings, protecting the interests of the people, of our entire society. Without exaggeration, a very important and significant body was added to Russia's state system in 1722. The prosecutor's office, formed by Peter the Great, became the country's highest supervisory body.""Supervise hard"" was what Peter the Great ordered in one of his decrees, and these words determined the substance and the very nature of a prosecutor's work. The role of the prosecutor's office continued to grow during Catherine the Great's time, and then during the reforms of Alexander II. That was fully justified because the prosecutor's office worked in an appropriate manner; prosecutors monitored the work of leading state institutions, protected the interests of the treasury and supported prosecution in court. It is impossible to imagine the development of Russian laws and the entire judicial system without their contribution. The names of Pavel Yaguzhinsky, Alexander Vyazemsky, Dmitry Dashkov and others went down in Russia's history as prominent leaders of the prosecutor's office. They set the high standards for many future generations of the office's employees. We also remember that, even after the revolutionary upheavals in the 20th century and during the tragic period of massive repressions, the best workers of the prosecutor's office preserved their professional honour and good name. They shared the hardest trials with many of our people, with many citizens, with all people of Russia. At the same time, I am expecting you to address your tasks even more quickly and competently, and I hopethat you will always be guided by order and justice, by efforts to protect the people, their rights, freedoms and legitimate interests, and that this will serve as your main value. In this connection, I would like to note that, in their work, prosecutors should, first of all, prioritise people's complaints and the solution of the problems that concern them the most. Last year, people submitted about five million complaints to prosecutor's offices, and this means that they can see and appreciate your efforts, and it is important to justify their trust. First of all, it is necessary to quickly and attentively respond to any encroachments on citizens' social rights, to ensure timely and complete payments, the required benefits, compensations and so on, so that people obtain high-quality medical treatment. First and foremost, this, of course, concerns people with disabilities and retired persons, orphaned children, underprivileged families and those with many children. Efforts to fight corruption, extremism and other crimes are one of your high-priority tasks. The prosecution authorities alone are supposed to coordinate the actions of all law enforcement agencies in the struggle against the criminal threat, and it is necessary to use your wide-ranging powers more effectively at all stages, from crime prevention and detection to indicting defendants in the courtroom. You should act skilfully, firmly and consistently. It is necessary to more closely monitor compliance with law in prisons and penitentiaries. This work should be conducted in collaboration with other state agencies, and public and human rights organisations. Protection of entrepreneurs' rights is another important task. We often discuss this matter, and one can even say that we discuss it all the time. Over the past 13 years, since the enactment of the law on state control, prosecutors' oversight has rid businesses of millions of unjustified checks. You should not rest on your laurels, and you should step up this work and continue with it. The business and investment climate, as well as the overall successful and dynamic development of the national economy, largely depend on this. Ecology, environmental protection, above all strict observation of modern standards in this area should permanently remain the focus of attention. I will add that new important powers were conferred on the Prosecutor General's Office in the summer of 2021. I mean representation of our country in interstate authorities, foreign and international courts and arbitration tribunals. Actually, this creates additional mechanisms for protecting Russia's interests and our citizens' rights. I seriously expect the prosecutors to do this job at the highest professional level. And, of course, in all key areas the prosecutor's supervision should be of a pre-emptive nature. I have said this on numerous occasions and want to underscore it once again: it is important not only to stop any violations of law but to reveal systemic issues too– this is also one of the ways to enhance the efficiency of your work. Friends, The three-century-long journey of our prosecutor's office is a history of statehood protection, of service to the law and society, and the state, on its part, will pay the most serious attention to the support and development of the prosecution system, improve the legal framework of your activity, and enhance the technical, information and analysis, and, of course, human resources potential. At all times, at the sharpest turning points in history, the best employees of the prosecutor's office were distinguished by their objectivity and independence, responsibility and personal integrity. On this special day I want to say thank you to the veterans, who faithfully served the law and our country, and to express gratitude to the entire prosecution corps of Russia for finding responsible solutions to serious problems facing our country. I am sure of your professionalism and that by your dedicated work and achievements, you will write new remarkable pages in the history of Russia's prosecutor's office. I wish you every success and congratulate you on your holiday. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67577,Meeting with Government members,2022-01-12T12:20:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow","The President held the first meeting with Government members in 2022, via videoconference.","Taking part in the meeting were Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Anton Vaino, First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov, First Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Sergei Kiriyenko, deputy prime ministers Viktoria Abramchenko, Tatyana Golikova, Alexander Novak, Alexei Overchuk and Dmitry Chernyshenko, Deputy Prime Minister – Chief of the Government Staff Dmitry Grigorenko, Deputy Prime Minister – Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoy to the Far Eastern Federal District Yury Trutnev, Presidential Aide Maxim Oreshkin, Minister of Economic Development Maxim Reshetnikov and Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov. First Deputy Speaker of the Federation Council – Secretary of the United Russia Party General Council Andrei Turchak, Minister of Transport Vitaly Savelyev, Minister of Energy Nikolai Shulginov, Chairman of the Accounts Chamber Alexei Kudrin, Governor of the Kemerovo Region – Kuzbass – Chairman of the State Council Commission on Energy Sergei Tsivilev, and Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller were invited to attend the meeting. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues. I am delighted to see all of you. This is our first working meeting this year in this format. Thankfully, the holidays are coming to an end, and we can see that they have passed calmly and smoothly. Life goes on, though. And the issue on our agenda today is a matter of concern to millions of our citizens – the connection of households to gas supply networks. Alexander Novak will deliver the report, and I would also like Andrei Turchak to say a few words on this matter, because United Russia has been involved in it from the very beginning. However, I would like to begin with the coronavirus response efforts. The virus is still giving us a hard time, and not only us but the world as a whole. We can see what is happening in the United States, where over a million people, or actually 1.3 million, have contracted the disease, as far as I know. The situation with the omicron variant is much the same in several European countries. This offers further proof that our decision to dispatch a group of specialists to the South African Republic was the right one. Once again, I would like to thank the President of South Africa and his colleagues for enabling us to work with this strain right on the spot where it emerged and was detected. I do hope that we will benefit from this initiative in terms of being able to take the necessary decisions in a timely manner. It is also obvious that we are now facing an extremely challenging situation as we anticipate new possible outbreaks, especially since we had these long holidays with people getting together a lot. This will definitely affect the epidemiological situation in the country. I would like Ms Golikova to begin our meeting today. Ms Golikova, the floor is yours. Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova: Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr President, colleagues. I will report on the current developments, as we have agreed. The incidence rate in the Russian Federation at the end of the first week of the year stood at 76.3 cases per 100,000 people, down 19.4 percent compared to the last week of 2021. However, this gives us a misleading picture, since certain regions performed fewer tests in the last weeks of 2021 and in the first week of 2022. In fact, we had 239 tests per 100,000 people in the first week of 2022 with testing levels decreasing in 66 regions of Russia. Let me remind you that under the guidelines issued by the Federal Service for the Oversight of Consumer Protection and Welfare we must have 300 tests per 100,000 people. Yesterday during the Coordination Council meeting chaired by Mr Mishustin we had a detailed discussion on the testing issue, and the Prime Minister instructed all the regions not only to comply with the regulatory guidelines but to exceed them. The logic is abundantly clear: early detection helps stop the virus from spreading and enables us to provide patients with timely assistance and treatment. Let me remind you that, just as we have already reported to you, the Government allocated funds for the delivery of express COVID-19 tests to the regions in order to be able to differentiate between COVID, flu, tonsillitis and other colds that have similar symptoms. Our plan is to deliver three million testing kits in the near future. We have already delivered 810,000 tests to 25 regions. The Government is drafting a new decision to earmark funds for the delivery of 3.5 million express tests each month throughout the first half of 2022. In addition to this, in November 2021, the Government compiled an exhaustive single list of indications for all regions for carrying out COVID-19 PCR tests covered by mandatory health insurance as part of the state programme guaranteeing free healthcare services to the citizens of the Russian Federation. This measure has been renewed for 2022 so that every citizen with flu symptoms or a positive express test undergoes a full COVID testing for free. At the same time, regions can add more indications for carrying out tests at their own expense. (Tatyana Golikova went on to share specific data on the occupancy of hospital beds and herd immunity, saying that this figure for the entire country currently stands at 63.2 percent. She also reported on the declining death rate in the country, which is attributable to the decreasing incidence rate, as well as ongoing vaccination: in December 2021, the death rate decreased 16.4 percent compared to November 2021, and was down 11.6 percent compared to December 2020. Ms Golikova pointed out that the most substantial increase in vaccinations happened in late September and early October 2021, which largely explains the decline in incidence and death rates.) In your opening remarks, you also talked about the developments around the world and in Russia in late 2021. This is when the Omicron strain started to gain momentum. Unfortunately, we now have a clear understanding that a new outbreak cannot be avoided, but our mission is to do everything to contain the infection. The Government drafted a plan of action to this effect and presented it to you in late 2021. In late December, regions received a set of instructions and by now have fulfilled them or are still working on these tasks. (According to Tatyana Golikova, this includes, in particular, stepping up controls for making sure that confirmed and contact cases, as well as people returning from countries with an unfavourable epidemiological situation, remain isolated. This also includes ensuring that the necessary medicines, PPE and oxygen are available, and that medical institutions, ambulance services and laboratories are ready for the outbreak.) Looking at how Omicron is spreading abroad, as well as the fact that it has been detected in and around the capital and in a number of other regions across the country, we see that this new strain is quite contagious, in fact three to seven times more contagious, according to various estimates. We have already detected 698 cases of this kind, most of them in and around Moscow. The capital and its suburbs will most likely suffer from the new strain before other regions, since unfortunately this negative trend is already there. Therefore, we believe that with this contagiousness the transmission and detection rate of the new coronavirus variant can increase several times over. The system must prepare for this blow and promptly take comprehensive response measures so as to provide the necessary medical assistance. What are we doing towards this end? As per the instructions from the Prime Minister, we are coordinating additional, emergency response measures, including financial support for the actions we will need to take in case of an adverse scenario. We will formulate our proposals by the end of the week. Next Tuesday, the Prime Minister plans to hold a conference meeting with the regions, as you have instructed, in order to discuss these measures, including financial support, which will be approved and reported to you, so that they will be implemented in case of an unfavourable scenario, as I have mentioned. Mr President, this is all I have to say about the epidemiological situation. Vladimir Putin: Ok, thank you. All of you have mentioned this, but I will nevertheless repeat the main points. First of all, it is the readiness of our hospitals and industries, including the pharmaceutical industry and the sectors that produce oxygen, face masks, PPE and so on. Second, we must increase the number of tests, of course. You are correct that we must do this, and COVID-19 vaccination must continue. I have talked about this with several governors in the past few days. There are matters we must address, and we must do this quickly. It appears that Sputnik V is quite effective, and possibly even more effective than other vaccines in the world. At least, it can obviously neutralise the virus. And we must also increase the vaccination rate; we must keep this in mind. In this connection, I would like to ask the Prime Minister to discuss this issue with the regions without delay, because we know that an effective response includes the mobilisation of various institutions, including federal, regional, local and industry-specific ones. The issue must be discussed with all of them to get prepared for possible new attacks of this virus at the next stage of its development. We can see what is happening in the world, as I have said at the beginning and as Ms Golikova has mentioned just now. This means that we have several weeks to make the necessary preparations. Some obvious things cannot be avoided, such as communication between people and holiday travel to foreign destinations, including countries where the epidemiological situation is complicated. Therefore, we must get ready. Please, Mr Mishustin, I would like to ask you to discuss this with the regional authorities as soon as possible. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin: Will do. <…>"

Taking part in the meeting were Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan, President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko, President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, Prime Minister of Kyrgyzstan Akylbek Japarov, President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon and Secretary General of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation Stanislav Zas. * * * Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan: Good morning, colleagues. Following an appeal from the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan and with your support, we are holding, via videoconference, an extraordinary session of the CSTO Collective Security Council. Today, the Republic of Kazakhstan has announced a national day of mourning, and before we start our work, I ask you to honour the memory of those who died as a result of the events that took place in the Republic of Kazakhstan with a minute of silence. (Minute of silence) Thank you. Please take your seats. I suggest we continue the session and start with the agenda. There is one issue that has been proposed – the situation in the Republic of Kazakhstan and measures to normalise it. If there are no additional proposals, I suggest we approve this agenda. As I understand, there are no objections, and therefore I suggest that after my brief introductory remarks, which are part of the discussion of the matter at hand, the floor should go to President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who will report on the developments in his country. Next to speak is CSTO Secretary General Stanislav Zas, who will report on the implementation of the decisions adopted by the CSTO's Collective Security Council and Defence Ministers' Council on providing assistance to the Republic of Kazakhstan. After that, I suggest that the floor go to the Collective Security Council members in alphabetical order and next to the Prime Minister and Head of the Executive Office of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic for an exchange of views. Is this order of proceedings acceptable? Then let us start our work. Colleagues, Mr Secretary General of the CSTO. Thank you for your prompt response and for your participation in today's extraordinary session of the Collective Security Council on the situation in the Republic of Kazakhstan and measures to normalise it. In view of the developments in the country, developments fraught with further escalation, the President of Kazakhstan officially appealed to the CSTO Collective Security Council. Based on this appeal and in keeping with the Collective Security Treaty and the CSTO Charter, I, acting in strict compliance with the functions of the current CSC Chairman, have launched the mechanism of consultations with the heads of CSTO member states. Given Kazakhstan's official appeal and taking into consideration the tendency for rapid developments, as well as in view of an emerging threat to the country's security, stability and sovereignty, in order to normalise the situation in Kazakhstan, the CSTO Collective Security Council has adopted a consensus decision to send peacekeepers to Kazakhstan for a limited period of time to guard strategically important facilities in line with the Collective Security Treaty, the CSTO Charter, and the CSTO Agreement on Peacekeeping Activities. Colleagues, now I would like, as we have agreed, to give the floor to President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. Please, Mr Tokayev. President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: Colleagues, The holding of our extraordinary summit is linked with extreme events: for several days in January, Kazakhstan went through a grave crisis that was the worst in its entire 30-year history of independence. Our organisation has not faced a threat at this level, either. I would like to thank our Chairman, Nikol Pashinyan for the prompt coordination of the necessary documents. I would also like to convey my special words of gratitude to President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin for the understanding and quick solution of the issue of sending a CSTO peacemaking contingent to Kazakhstan. Mr Putin, we have been in constant contact with you since the first days of the terrorist attack on our country. I am grateful to Alexander Lukashenko, Sadyr Japarov and Emomali Rahmon for the political and even combat fraternity. Today, we are having a day of nationwide mourning over those killed during the days of tragedy in Kazakhstan. I am sincerely grateful to you for your condolences. I would like to express my gratitude to CSTO Secretary General Stanislav Zas and the entire cohesive team of the Secretariat and the United Staff of our Organisation. In fact, this is the first case where the CSTO has used its peacemaking potential in practice to ensure the security, stability and integrity of one of its members. For us, not only the military but also and primarily the moral support of our CSTO partners is of principle importance. All CSTO member states acted as a united front and resolutely supported Kazakhstan's request. Now I would like to tell you about the current developments in our country and the events of the past few days. Having a full picture of these events, I can say with responsibility that all the events that have taken place since the beginning of this year are links in the same chain. They are part of a single destructive scenario that has been in preparation for a long time. Investigation will reveal whether these preparations were made over one, two or three years. Destructive forces made numerous attempts to undermine stability and start a rampage. The state was tested for stability and resistance. All these efforts were cut short resolutely, but the organisers did not abandon their plans and started preparing for armed action. They used public discontent over vehicle fuel prices as a pretext in several regions. Rallies were held, during which protesters advanced socio-economic and socio-political demands. The state took these demands into account and acted on them. The government withdrew, prices of LPG fuel have been reduced and frozen. We announced the adoption of a package of practical socio-economic measures and a clear-cut plan of socio-political reforms. But it no longer mattered for the organisers of this aggression against Kazakhstan. Spontaneous rallies were used as a pretext for provoking civil unrest. Religious radicals, criminals, outright thugs, looters and petty hooligans filled the streets as if on cue. Socio-economic and socio-political demands were put on the back burner, they were forgotten. Next followed the hot phase, and armed fighters, who were biding their time, took over. The main goal of these events became clear – to undermine the constitutional system, destroy governance institutions and seize power. It is obvious now that these armed activities were coordinated from a single centre, and the carefully planned operation entered its decisive phase. Proof of this is provided by the simultaneous – I repeat, simultaneous – attacks on the buildings of regional governments, law enforcement agencies, pretrial detention centres, strategic facilities, banks, the TV tower and television channels. They seized airports, blocked motorways and railway lines and hindered the operation of ambulances and fire-fighters. During attacks on military units and checkpoints, the thugs attempted to seize weapons and military equipment. Real fighting went on in Almaty and several other cities. For example, the attack on the Interior Ministry department in Almaty went on for two nights. The police repelled the attacks. Seven armourers' shops were seized in Almaty alone. These attacks were staged by trained professionals, including snipers armed with special rifles. The terrorists used special communication equipment and wore military and police uniforms. They cynically used the protesters as human shields. Using their five-fold superiority in terms of numbers, the thugs attacked our police and military personnel, beating them up with extreme brutality, decapitating two of them. There were barbarous attacks on hospitals. Seeking to stretch the state's resources, the masterminds organised their attack across a wide front. Their aggression was taking place across 11 regions simultaneously, but their main blow was directed at Almaty. As you know, this is the largest city in Kazakhstan, the country's financial centre, which also serves as the main transport and communications hub. Losing control of this city would have paved the way to losing the densely populated southern part of the country and then the country in its entirety. Terrorists hoped to stretch thin the law enforcement agencies and then attack the capital of Kazakhstan. We have seen fighters converge on the President's residence. In fact, this was a real war unleashed by terrorists against our state using various methods. We had to take unprecedented measures in response. Kazakhstan's military and law enforcement agencies have succeeded in mobilising themselves, rebuffing the attackers, and taking control of the situation. Unfortunately, this came at a very high cost: there were casualties in the military and law enforcement agencies, as well as among civilians, with 16 members of law enforcement and the military dead and over 1,300 wounded. Unfortunately, there were also civilian casualties, although we have yet to obtain the exact figures. More than 1,270 businesses were affected across the country, with more than 100 shopping centres and banks looted. The police alone lost about 500 vehicles, either damaged or burnt. The physical damage has been huge, and a special government commission has been tasked with assessing it. I can tell you in all certainty that terrorists, including foreign fighters, were directly involved in the aggression against Kazakhstan. It was not a coincidence that the criminals attacked morgues at night to collect and drive away with the corpses of their dead accomplices. They also took the corpses of fighters from the battlefield. We know what kind of international terrorists do this: this is how they cover up their tracks. It is obvious that they want to sow chaos in our country to seize power. In keeping with the resolution of Kazakhstan's Security Council and based on a comprehensive analysis carried out by the law enforcement agencies and special services, we designated these developments as a terrorist threat and an act of aggression. These developments reached a critical point when criminals took control of Almaty and nine regional capitals. This is when we declared a counter-terrorist operation. Kazakhstan turned to the CSTO for assistance, which proved to be extremely timely. When the fighters learned that three cargo planes had arrived in the country's capital, they gave up on their plan to seize the President's residence. This enabled us to send more forces to Almaty and recapture the city from the hands of the terrorists. To date, in accordance with the Collective Security Council's decision, the CSTO Collective Peacekeeping Forces of 2,030 troops and 250 pieces of equipment have been deployed in the Republic of Kazakhstan and have begun to fulfil their assigned tasks. They are protecting and ensuring the security of airports, military depots and other strategic facilities. We will later hear the CSTO Secretary General's report on the situation and progress. As I have said, this is the first CSTO peacekeeping mission. I am sure that the organisation will gain useful, positive experience, will analyse problem areas, draw appropriate conclusions, and make adjustments to its regulatory documents. Overall, I would like to emphasise that the CSTO has shown its relevance and effectiveness as a high-profile military-political organisation, an operational mechanism to ensure the stability and security of our states. The recent events have actually become a turning point in the organisation's development; the CSTO has acquired new qualities as a strong international institution. The threats faced by Kazakhstan are common to the entire collective security space; therefore, it is important for us to further strengthen the organisation's powerful potential, and Kazakhstan will contribute to this. One of the possible recommendations may be to optimise crisis response time. We must also make and approve the Collective Security Council and other bodies' decisions more efficiently. It is also important to ensure maximum political support for the decision to use the CSTO peacekeeping forces, especially from the United Nations and other major international platforms, leading media outlets and think tanks from different countries. We can see already that the legitimacy of deploying the CSTO forces in Kazakhstan is being questioned. This is happening due to a lack of reliable information and a misunderstanding of the entire situation. In some cases, the international community, including foreign media, seems to entertain entirely incorrect interpretations of both the use of CSTO forces and the overall situation in Kazakhstan. Despite the available evidence, some sources are claiming that the Kazakhstani authorities are cracking down on a peaceful protest. This is absolute misinformation. We have never used and will not use armed force against peaceful demonstrators. Being aware of this, those behind the attack on Kazakhstan have orchestrated several waves of aggression. Early on, as I mentioned, peaceful protests took place. Then, political rallies were held in Almaty among other places, after which armed militants rushed into the city from three directions like a huge pack of hyenas. At first, they pretended to be peaceful demonstrators and misled the law enforcement units and even city residents, and what followed will probably go down in history as the Almaty tragedy. In the meantime, the UN Charter recognises each state's inalienable right to individual – I stress – or collective self-defence in the event of an armed attack from outside. Soon, after the preliminary investigation is complete, we will present additional evidence to the international community that corroborates the preparation and holding of a terrorist aggression against our country. As we are seeing, individual media outlets and public institutions continue to plant false information based on fabrications and unverified facts. I am confident that international organisations, including the UN, the OSCE, the SCO, and the CIS, as well as international humanitarian organisations, are interested in a full and impartial investigation into the illegal actions of terrorists, criminals, and wrongdoers. At the same time, we should not jump to hasty conclusions. I thank everyone, who from the very beginning remained confident that Kazakhstan would overcome this difficult stage in our modern history. This is particularly true of the CSTO. I am convinced that acting jointly, we will make the temporary deployment of CSTO peacekeeping efforts in Kazakhstan as safe and effective as possible. The truth of the matter is that the CSTO peacekeeping contingent's mission was extremely effective and useful. I think this is a lesson that Kazakhstan must learn, but I think it will be useful for all CSTO member states as well. In no case should we allow an information vacuum to be filled by instigators or ill-wishers. Unfortunately, this is still the case in Kazakhstan. In these circumstances, our recent decision to establish the institution of a CSTO Secretary General Special Envoy for peacekeeping activities has confirmed its relevance. I would like to make it clear that we will be firm in defending the right of the people of Kazakhstan to freely express their will and to engage in an open dialogue with the authorities. At the same time, we will crack down on any forms of violent extremism and even more so on any hostilities in Kazakhstan like the ones that have been taking place over the past few days. We will not tolerate any attacks against Kazakhstan's state sovereignty or territorial integrity. Let me assure you that Kazakhstan will firmly abide by its international commitments. Friends, colleagues, We have restored constitutional order in Kazakhstan and averted dangerous threats to the country's security. As part of the counterterrorist operation, we are working to identify those who were involved in the crimes. As of today, the police have detained some eight thousand people. The law enforcement agencies and the special services are about to verify whether they were involved in terrorist acts, killings, looting or other crimes. We have confiscated 116 weapons. This is an ongoing operation, and since the fighters on the run are using new tactics to conceal themselves by wearing civilian clothes, shaving their beards, etc., we are also making the necessary adjustments to the way we operate. We have a lot of work ahead of us and have even reached out to veterans from the law enforcement agencies and the military to assist us in these efforts. All state agencies are working hard to bring the country back to normal. Tomorrow I will submit my proposals on the new cabinet to parliament and will set forth specific objectives for overcoming urgent socioeconomic challenges. The large-scale counterterrorist operation will end soon, and with it, the successful and effective mission by the CSTO forces will also end. Most importantly, we need to prevent events of this kind from repeating across our collective security space. I think that this is our core mission for the near future. Kazakhstan is ready to move in this direction and will always stand by its allies. Thank you for your attention. Nikol Pashinyan: Thank you, Mr Tokayev, for sharing this meaningful update. I now give the floor to CSTO Secretary General Stanislav Zas, who will report on carrying out the resolutions of the Collective Security Council and the CSTO Council of Defence Ministers to assist the Republic of Kazakhstan. Mr Zas, please. Secretary General of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation Stanislav Zas: Mr Chairman and members of the Collective Security Council, Based on the current situation in Kazakhstan and the address by President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev and in view of implementing your agreements to send the CSTO Collective Peacekeeping Forces to Kazakhstan, the CSTO Secretariat and United Staff have immediately started drafting legally justified resolutions on conducting a peacekeeping mission and coordinating the deployment of the CSTO Collective Peacekeeping Forces in the Republic of Kazakhstan. On January 6 of this year we sent, for your approval, a draft decision by the Collective Security Council on normalising the situation in the Republic of Kazakhstan. I would like to thank you for the quick adoption of this document, which allowed us to start moving forces to Kazakhstan on the same day. At your instructions, and under the Agreement on CSTO Peacekeeping Activities, we informed the members of the UN Security Council, via the UN Secretary-General, of the adopted decisions on holding a peacekeeping operation in the Republic of Kazakhstan. I have also reported this to my OSCE and SCO counterparts. At the same time, we explained to the media the underlying reasons for the decisions and mechanisms for implementation. Fulfilling your decision on the following day, January 7, the CSTO Council of Defence Ministers established the Collective Peacekeeping Forces. Commander of the Airborne Forces of the Russian Federation Colonel-General Andrei Serdyukov was appointed commander of these forces. By the same decision, the Council of Defence Ministers determined the tasks of these forces and settled other issues. In effect, we spent two days on the organisational procedures. Simultaneously, we were deploying the Collective Peacekeeping Forces. Yesterday, we fully completed this deployment. Over four days, Russian Aerospace Forces planes made over 108 flights. We have deployed contingents of the Collective Peacekeeping Forces in the cities of Nur-Sultan, Almaty, and Almaty Region. We have established command posts in the Military Institute of Ground Troops in Almaty. Logistical support for military contingents is provided by the supporting states or on a bilateral or multilateral basis. In accordance with the plan of operation coordinated with the Kazakh side, the Collective Peacekeeping Forces began to take steps to strengthen the guarding and defence of important military and government facilities, as well as to create conditions for stabilisation in their zones of responsibility. The CSTO crisis response centre, where we are now, provides for a round-the-clock exchange of updates with the Collective Peacekeeping Forces command and the defence ministries of the CSTO member states. An operations group led by the deputy chief of the Joint Staff has been dispatched to Kazakhstan to coordinate the Collective Peacekeeping Forces. I am flying to Kazakhstan tomorrow, as agreed with the President of Kazakhstan and a representative of the Council, to review the situation on the spot and to meet with the commander and the leaders of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Members of the Collective Security Council, To date, all the necessary steps have been taken to fulfil your decision to launch the CSTO peacekeeping operation. Yesterday I spoke with the commander of the Collective Peacekeeping Forces, Colonel-General Serdyukov. According to his report, there are no problems that would need to be addressed at the heads of state level. By the way, it was quite gratifying yesterday to hear the General, the commander of our peacekeeping group, who said that any welfare or organisational issues that arise are resolved right away. Special gratitude has been extended to the Ministry of Defence of Kazakhstan, of course. He said we live and accomplish our tasks as one family. Members of the Collective Security Council, In conclusion, I admit that this is our first experience with such an operation. Later on, we will certainly have time to calmly debrief, learn our lessons and draw conclusions. But even now, one can definitely draw one conclusion, the most important one: the peacekeeping potential and the mechanism for its use, which has been created in our organisation, really works and is suitable for achieving the set goals. Thank you for your attention. Nikol Pashinyan: Thank you, Mr Zas. I now give the floor to President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko. Please, Mr Lukashenko. President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko: Mr Pashinyan, colleagues, First of all, I would like to thank Mr Tokayev for his detailed report on the situation in the republic. Today, the President has announced a day of national mourning. On behalf of the people of Belarus, please accept our condolences in connection with the death of Kazakhstani law enforcement officers, service personnel and civilians. Of course, an assessment of developments in Kazakhstan highlights the presence of an external factor. They have a recognisable scenario, as the President of Kazakhstan has noted. One can mention quite a few other similar developments, including those in Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Ukraine, and Afghanistan. Belarus also experienced a similar combined onslaught not so long ago. Of course, these countries had their own peculiarities, but the overall trend is obvious. Yes, we now talk a lot about foreign involvement, and the President of Kazakhstan is right in saying that the names, surnames, addresses, passwords and secret addresses of these activists will soon be made public. But we should understand that the external factor will not be the only one, and that it is necessary to see domestic factors behind all external factors. We have learned this lesson from Belarusian developments. We should realise that too many entities around the people and the state of Kazakhstan (whom we consider near and dear) also want to destabilise the situation around former Soviet Central Asian republics. Afghanistan was recently added to their list. I would like to note once again that we have reached an inexorable conclusion: many international terrorists have accumulated on the borders with Kazakhstan, as the latest developments show. This is the first thing. Second, it is impossible to resolve this problem solely within the framework of Kazakhstan, a country with a huge territory, in order to overcome these negative trends in our former Soviet republics. As we see it, and I am absolutely convinced of this, the closest peoples – those of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan should jointly try to resolve the difficult problems inherited by them and those created by us during the post-Soviet period. Please forgive me, but, first of all, Uzbekistan should learn the lessons that have been discussed here for quite a while. According to our information, they have already shifted their gaze towards Uzbekistan, unless these lessons are learned; and you can already see this there. Most importantly, we need to learn specific lessons. The leaders of Kazakhstan are assessing these lessons today. They include the above-mentioned external lessons, and the relevant conclusions will be drawn in the near future. There are also domestic lessons to consider. While analysing the situation in Belarus, we assume that external causes, which were fairly obvious in Belarus, are not so obvious in Kazakhstan. Nevertheless, the President of Kazakhstan is trying to get to the gist of the matter. I am confident that he will succeed. But, proceeding from Belarusian developments, we are not forgetting about the domestic causes either. The same is true of other republics. We have to see this clearly. We could witness a relapse, unless we understand this and stop blaming only the external factor. Let me remind you about the risks and threats related to the creation of so-called terrorist sleeper cells in Central Asia. These are extremists who will wake up one day, as Mr Rahmon has said. We have taken note of these warnings but have probably underestimated the risks. Let us be honest: sometimes we thought that we would be spared this scourge. Now we see that professional terrorist fighters make up the core of the protesters in Kazakhstan. This is a very dangerous trend. We need to find out who organised and directed them. I am certain that the organisers and those who directed these events in Kazakhstan will not be easy to find. At the same time, I do believe that in Kazakhstan, just like in Belarus, the result will be the same. As my colleagues have said, the decision to send the CSTO Collective Peacekeeping Forces to Kazakhstan was timely and swift. I am certain that our efforts had a sobering effect on the destructive elements and made our allied ties, as well as the CSTO's viability and capability, obvious for the entire world to see. This is a lesson for us that we need to further improve the CSTO to make it better manageable along with the forces we are ready to use for this purpose. Serious challenges lie ahead. We need to strengthen the CSTO and to be calm and consistent in building up all capabilities, primarily the peacekeeping potential. It is also quite important to make sure that the CSTO retains its agility and ability to respond promptly. In this regard, we must not be shy in any way or look back at the West, the United States or anyone else. If we keep turning our head too far back, we risk breaking our neck. For this reason, we need to focus on our own agenda and our own security. When they face the slightest of challenges, they forget about democracy; they do not look back at us but act in a way that suits their interests best. We need to keep this in mind too. A crackdown at the very outset yields tangible results. Judging by the way the Western politicians have been acting, they are keeping a close eye on these developments. There was a pause of two or three days, maybe it was a weekend or something, but this gave them time to get organised. After two or three days, as the President of Russia and I have been discussing time and again, there came an avalanche of statements that were to be expected: ""democracy,"" ""freedom,"" ""unacceptable crackdown"" and so forth. It is obvious that the deployment of the CSTO Collective Peacekeeping Forces upended the plans of the masterminds who provoked this conflict and those who staged it. Once again, this demonstrates that our decisions were correct. In this regard, I would like to note that we must monitor the situation at all times, act proactively and stop the possible causes that lead to such consequences. The President of Kazakhstan did the right thing when, on the very first day, he held accountable those who let the first symptoms of these events happen. Just think about it: natural gas is in ample supply in Kazakhstan, and yet they doubled or even tripled the price. In this regard, we should act proactively in the media. No one should be allowed to portray the peacekeeping contingent as invaders. We have already seen such attempts. We are not invaders, and we did not go there by ourselves. We were invited by our brother and our friend who is in charge of this vast country, and we provided the support he requested from us. This is a lesson for everyone; this is a precedent, a solid precedent. Colleagues, today as never before, it is necessary to improve political interaction within the CSTO and to coordinate our positions in the international arena. The forms and methods of exerting hybrid influence on our countries are being improved in terms of quality. Acting within the CSTO, we must develop adequate response measures and do so assertively, as I mentioned earlier. It is important to improve information exchanges and to improve the quality of analysis. The mounting tensions are also pushing us to revise our joint measures to counter terrorism and extremism. This is a good reason for us to get together at some point and discuss Tajikistan. For years, the President of Tajikistan has been asking us for material support, primarily with military equipment, and we need to do this so that it does not cost us more in the future as in the case of Kazakhstan. It took almost 200 flights to airlift all of the equipment; fortunately, Russia agreed to do it. I would not like to see this happen in Tajikistan. It is better to help it now, and it will cope with these challenges. This applies to other republics as well. We must learn our lessons. We have focused a lot on fighting international terrorism, possibly underestimating in the process the danger posed by extremism in all its forms. It is necessary to expose the forces that, under certain circumstances, are capable of crossing the red line and embarking on a path of violence, as well as to harshly suppress their destructive activities in a timely manner. With regard to Belarus, colleagues, you can always count on our understanding, individual statements and support; we will always be faithful to our agreements. Thank you. Nikol Pashinyan: Thank you, Mr Lukashenko. I now give the floor to President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin. Please, President Putin, the floor is yours. President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much, colleagues. At this session we are discussing a truly serious issue of concern to all of us – the situation in Kazakhstan and ways to normalise it. And I agree with Mr Lukashenko that it concerns all of us. Regarding the developments in Kazakhstan, all of us know that President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has appealed to the member states of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation for assistance, because his country, a fraternal country and a CSTO member state, came across an unprecedented challenge to its security, integrity and sovereignty. We know that the current threat to Kazakhstan's statehood is not rooted in the spontaneous protests over fuel prices but in the fact that destructive internal and external forces made use of this situation. The people who protested over the situation on the fuel market and their goals are different from the people who took up arms to attack the state and their goals. Actively used were 'Maidan' technologies of armed and information support for the protests. There were organised and controlled groups of fighters, as President Tokayev has pointed out just now, including people who had apparently received training in terrorist camps abroad, and their attack on Kazakhstan, as President Tokayev has noted – and it was essentially an attack on the country, on Kazakhstan – amounts to an act of aggression. I fully agree with him in this regard. All of that called for an emergency response, and the appeal by the President of Kazakhstan was immediately supported by all heads of the CSTO member states and the Prime Minister of Armenia as the current Chair of the Collective Security Council. Crucially, our organisation and its secretariat have been able to take all the necessary decisions in a swift and well-coordinated manner. In fact, we had very little time and had to act in a matter of hours to prevent the foundations of state authority in Kazakhstan from being undermined, and the situation inside the country from deteriorating, as well as to stop terrorists, criminals, looters, and other criminal elements. The President of Kazakhstan has already told me during our telephone conversations that he has been receiving calls all the time from people asking and even pleading for him to protect them from these criminals and terrorists. We coordinated our joint steps to help the brotherly people of Kazakhstan in the swiftest possible manner, fully engaging the CSTO mechanism. The CSTO Collective Peacekeeping Forces have been sent to Kazakhstan. I would like to note that it will stay there for a limited period, as long as the President of Kazakhstan, the head of state, decides. Make no mistake, once it fulfils its mission, the entire force will leave the territory of Kazakhstan. We have succeeded in completing the deployment of this force within quite a short period of time. We view our joint actions as extremely timely and absolutely legitimate. The CSTO forces arrived in Kazakhstan following a formal request from the republic's leadership and strictly in keeping with Article 4 of the Collective Security Treaty of 1992. Under this article, in the event of aggression against any of the member states, all other countries shall immediately provide the affected member state, at its request, the necessary assistance and support, including military assistance. We have been witnessing an international terrorist aggression. Where did these armed groups come from? It is obvious that they were trained in foreign camps and acquired combat experience in hotspots around the world. Our organisation has demonstrated its potential and the ability to take swift, decisive and effective action. Each of our allies contributed to fulfilling this mission within the CSTO forces: they include units from all member states without exception that are already there and are proactively carrying out their mission. This shows that the CSTO's long-term work, I would like to stress that it is truly long-term and painstaking work to establish an integral security system for member states, including, of course, the CSTO Collective Peacekeeping Forces – this work is producing results. Colleagues, it is very important that our countries' service personnel train under common programmes, and that they are issued standard or compatible weapons, equipment and communications systems. We streamlined the deployment of peacekeepers during joint regular exercises. This was done for example during the CSTO's recent Indestructible Brotherhood exercise, organised with due account of Russian service personnel's combat experience in Syria. The exercise highlighted the impressive combat training levels, professionalism and cohesion of our service personnel and their ability to quickly accomplish counter-terrorism tasks and to protect the civilian population. It was precisely these purposeful joint combat training activities of CSTO countries' forces that made it possible to promptly deploy peacekeepers to Kazakhstan and to ensure their most effective performance. The CSTO contingent included the best-trained units of the Russian Airborne Forces, and all of them boast real combat experience. Colonel General Andrei Serdyukov, Commander of the Russian Airborne Forces, oversees the operations of the Collective Forces in Kazakhstan, and he knows what he is doing. The peacekeeping contingent immediately took over key infrastructure facilities, and is ensuring that the Kazakhstani authorities alone have control over them. In turn, Kazakhstani law enforcement and security agencies directly conduct counter-terrorism and combat operations, they protect civilians and exercise policing functions whenever necessary. In effect, our service personnel have replaced them at local infrastructure facilities, allowing the President of Kazakhstan to make effective use of national forces and resources in order to reestablish law and order in the country. As the speakers have already noted, the situation is being gradually normalised as a result of the measures implemented by the leaders of Kazakhstan with our support. Kazakhstan's service personnel and law enforcement agencies have completely expelled terrorists and bandits from a number of vital installations, including the Almaty International Airport. I am confident that our joint efforts will make it possible to fully reestablish control over the situation nationwide and to stabilise it, and that peace and tranquility will, at last, be reinstated in Kazakhstan. Of course, we understand that the events in Kazakhstan are not the first and certainly not the last attempt to interfere in the domestic affairs of our states from outside. I agree with the President of Belarus on this. The measures taken by the CSTO clearly show that we will not allow anyone to stir up trouble at home and will not permit the realisation of another so-called colour revolution scenario. Everybody knows that by means of the internet and social media, attempts are still being made to involve our citizens in protests that will then be followed by terrorist attacks, as was clearly and precisely described by the President of Kazakhstan when he recalled the timeline of the events. This timeline is clear; we have all witnessed these developments. Moreover, the latest developments in Kazakhstan confirm that certain forces are not above using the online space and social media to recruit extremists and terrorists and to create sleeper cells of militants. Therefore, it appears reasonable to instruct the CSTO Committee of Security Council Secretaries to present proposals – as part of the activities of their working groups on information security, countering terrorism and extremism – on the collective prevention of such attempts at destructive external interference in the CSTO's area of responsibility. Most importantly, we must make sure that events similar to the tragedy happening in the brotherly country of Kazakhstan will not catch us by surprise again and that we are fully mobilised and ready to push back against any new provocation. I would like to note the bravery with which the President of Kazakhstan faced these events and took charge of the counteraction, consolidated society, the security forces and citizens of his country in order to confront the external terrorists. I am certain that the leaders of Kazakhstan will do their best to restore normal operation of the country's law enforcement agencies and the economy. I do not doubt that for a moment. Finally, I would like to confirm that Russia intends to further prioritise strengthening the strategic alliance with all the CSTO member states. I am confident, of course, that the leaders and people of Kazakhstan (I want to stress this once again) will be able to handle this situation and respond to these serious challenges with honour. Thank you. Nikol Pashinyan: Thank you, Mr President. I would like to pass the floor to President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon. President Rahmon, please. President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon: Mr Pashinyan, colleagues, First of all, I would like to express our condolences to the people and President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev in the wake of the tragic events in this brotherly country. Please extend our sympathy and support to the families and loved ones of the victims. I would like to thank the President of Kazakhstan for the detailed information about the latest developments in his country. We fully support the measures being taken by the leadership of Kazakhstan to normalise the situation and restore order in the republic. In line with its CSTO obligations, Tajikistan also promptly responded to a request from the Kazakhstani leadership to assist with eliminating the current threat. Members of the peacekeeping battalion of the Tajikistani Defence Ministry currently serve in the CSTO Collective Peacekeeping Forces. Colleagues, I would like to share my view of the situation. The information Mr Tokayev provided clearly shows that decisions concerning pressing socioeconomic matters and stabilizing the situation in the country had been urgently taken. The tragedy in Kazakhstan once again confirms that it is necessary to intensify our joint comprehensive efforts to counter terrorism and extremism, religious radicalism and transnational organised crime, including drug trafficking. We have been fighting the destructive activity of terrorists, extremists, Islamic radicals and other criminal groups for the past 30 years, and we know very well this kind of security threat. Since the early days of its independence, Tajikistan has been fighting these challenges. Our country went through a civil war that took the lives of more than 150,000 people. I have repeatedly pointed out at our CSTO, CIS and SCO meetings that each of our countries are threatened by dormant seats of international terrorism, extremism and religious radicalism. They have never stopped recruiting and propaganda efforts among the citizens of the CSTO member states even for a day. An extremely destructive ideology of religious radicalism is being vigorously promoted in our countries; it is one of the main weapons in the hands of our enemies today. All this dramatically enhances the religious extremist potential and creates the threat of destabilisation in our states. In this regard, one needs to especially note the aggressive activity of the Salafi movement and Wahhabism. As we know, the followers of these doctrines make up the backbone of the Islamic State. In Tajikistan, we are doing our best to fight the propaganda and subversive work carried out by emissaries of these banned organisations; yet we record an increasing number of facts and phenomena that are related to online terrorist resources every year. At the same time, the citizens of our countries, including migrant workers, continue to be susceptible to terrorist propaganda. As a reminder, tens of thousands of citizens from the post-Soviet states surfaced in Iraq and Syria in a very short time; some of them were killed. A logical question is – where are the others? How many have been detained or returned to their homeland? Therefore, our countries need to establish more effective coordination of special services to respond to transnational organised crime, including cybercrime. Earlier, I proposed building an information protection system for the CIS. I believe this initiative is relevant and timely for the CSTO. At the same time, we consider it important to continue searching for and stopping the channels our citizens use to reach regions with increased terrorist activity, as well as the channels whereby persons involved in terrorism and extremism penetrate or return to the CSTO zone of responsibility. We need to focus on our citizens' unregulated travel to foreign religious educational centres, which is a problem because such students often receive extremist training there. Over the past few years, Tajikistan has not only neutralised the channels whereby its citizens had reached such religious educational centres, but also brought more than 5,000 people back.  Colleagues, The invigorated activities of international terrorist groups in Afghanistan are directly affecting the CSTO collective security zone. We know that thousands of their members have been released from prisons in Afghanistan since late August. They were members of ISIS, al-Qaeda, Ansarullah,Hizb ut-Tahrir, and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, to name a few. Since then, they have stepped up their activities and strengthened their combat and subversion potential. We are seriously concerned about the consolidation of positions by ISIS militants, especially in Khorasan Province. In all, according to our secret services, there are over 40 terrorist training camps and centres on the CSTO's southern borders and in the northeast provinces of Afghanistan with more than 6,000 militants. The CSTO states should take very seriously the risk that watching the strengthening of terrorists in Afghanistan and having secured their support, some of our citizens might resort to extreme measures. If participation by our citizens in the unrest in Kazakhstan is confirmed, I consider it important to develop closer coordination of law enforcement agencies in the CSTO member-countries with a view to preventing such cases and taking tough measures against them. I believe terrorists have no homeland, religion or ethnic origin and must be destroyed wherever they are. We fully support you, Mr Tokayev. Our ministers, security and law enforcement agencies are always in contact. Their work is well coordinated. At the same time, I would like to recall that we have not yet implemented the Collective Security Council resolution on compiling a common CSTO list of terrorist organisations. This is a very serious problem. In addition, we are concerned over the absence of a targeted interstate programme on strengthening the Tajik-Afghan border. Colleagues, President Lukashenko mentioned that the situation at the Tajik-Afghan border is becoming more complicated every day. Taliban members are fighting each other along the border. In the past few weeks, approximately 11 of them were killed and more than 18 were wounded in just one section. Therefore, we must create a ""security belt"" around Afghanistan. Colleagues, In conclusion, I would like to express once again our solidarity with and full support for the efforts of President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev to establish law and order in the country. We are convinced that brotherly Kazakhstan is fully capable of achieving this and its wise people will manage to stabilise the situation as soon as possible. Thank you for your attention. Nikol Pashinyan: Thank you, Mr Rahmon. Now I am giving the floor to the Prime Minister and Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office of the Kyrgyz Republic, Akylbek Japarov. Mr Japarov, please.  Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers and Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office of Kyrgyzstan Akylbek Japarov: Mr Pashinyan, participants in the extraordinary session, First of all, I would like to thank Armenia for hosting today's meeting, the relevance and importance of which is beyond doubt. Once again, we express our deep condolences to the Kazakhstani side in connection with the tragic loss of life as a result of the clashes and wish a speedy recovery to everyone who was injured. Kazakhstan is our closest ally and strategic partner, and our duty today is to stand with it in solidarity. The ongoing global changes around the world, political cataclysms, the transformation of challenges and threats to security, and other factors directly affect the military-political situation in the CSTO collective security region. The tragic events that have unfolded in Kazakhstan prove that. Using the ongoing domestic processes, destructive elements are combining their terrorist activities to undermine statehood, security and territorial integrity, and are creating an atmosphere of chaos, permissiveness and rampant crime. In this vein, Kazakhstan's initiative to put into operation the CSTO collective security system's mechanisms in the circumstances at hand undoubtedly confirms the unity of the CSTO member states' approaches to the existing challenges and threats to security. The fundamental principles underlying the creation and functioning of this organisation, its foreign policy and military components, taking into account the accumulated potential, make it possible to respond in a timely manner to the crises in all their hybrid manifestations. However, the complete stabilisation of the situation in the Republic of Kazakhstan remains our main priority. Meeting participants, We have been following with concern the events in fraternal Kazakhstan from day one. We are opposed to terrorism in any form and manifestation, and sincerely want to see the situation in the Republic of Kazakhstan get back to normal and peace and order return to that country as soon as possible. Today, more than ever, it is important to find a mutually acceptable solution and prevent further escalation of the situation. Immediately after President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev's request for assistance in accordance with the obligations under the CSTO, President of the Kyrgyz Republic Sadyr Japarov decided to send a limited contingent of the Kyrgyz Republic's armed forces to Kazakhstan with a mandate to participate in the CSTO peacekeeping operation. On January 7, an extraordinary session of parliament was convened in Kyrgyzstan, where this decision was supported by the majority of the deputies. On the same day, January 7, a 150-strong peacekeeping military contingent of the armed forces of the Kyrgyz Republic, including experienced officers and contract servicemen, as well as eight armoured vehicles and 12 motor vehicles, flew to the Republic of Kazakhstan. I want to emphasise that we are prepared to continue to make every effort to normalise the situation in the neighbouring country. Participants in this session, Instability and growing violence are likely to worsen the socio-economic situation in Kazakhstan and negatively affect all of us. In this situation, we consider it particularly important to provide conditions for the unimpeded movement of people and cargo to promote socio-economic development and maintain stability in the region. It is important to maintain sustainable economic development in the region and take the necessary measures to keep up favourable conditions for businesses and interbank ties. According to incoming reports, criminals have acquired many firearms. There is the risk that the criminal elements who took part in the looting and atrocities could move across our state borders. With this in mind, the current situation in Kazakhstan compels us to take joint efforts to restore stability there and prevent attacks on its military, administrative and social facilities. As a support measure, we have decided to allow citizens of all countries, including Kazakhstan, to cross the Kyrgyz-Kazakhstani border into Kyrgyzstan without presenting certificates of negative PCR tests. During this time, Kyrgyzstan has also provided temporary accommodation for citizens of Kazakhstan returning from Turkey, the Arab Emirates and other states, who are arriving at Manas International Airport out of necessity. They are being transported to the Kyrgyz-Kazakhstani border in an organised way. I am pleased to note that many Kyrgyz citizens do not remain indifferent to this situation and are rendering all kinds of voluntary assistance. All Kyrgyz people are deeply sympathetic with their Kazakh brothers and sincerely wish them an early settlement. At the same time, I have to note that the mass media and social networks have been spreading information on the involvement of foreigners, including Kyrgyz citizens, in pogroms and disorder. In this context, I would like to request and hope for an open and fair investigation into each confirmed case, to be carried out under Kazakh law and in strict conformity with our bilateral and multilateral agreements. Ladies and gentlemen, In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that the Kyrgyz Republic has invariably supported stability, socio-economic progress, stronger statehood and prosperity in Kazakhstan. Kyrgyzstan has always been and will remain close to Kazakhstan. If necessary, and at Kazakhstan's request, we are prepared to provide the necessary assistance to the people of Kazakhstan, proceeding from the strong relations between the two fraternal nations. Please allow me to convey again my condolences to Kazakhstan over the human loss and to wish an early recovery to the wounded. Thank you for your attention. Nikol Pashinyan: Thank you, Mr Japarov. Heads of delegations, Mr Secretary General, Thank you for your substantive remarks and detailed information. Unfortunately, we must state that there is no visible reduction in tension in the CSTO area of responsibility and we continue to face new types of threats. The current situation in the Republic of Kazakhstan is a cause for concern in view of the information about the international terrorist entities involved in the events. In the recent past, we ourselves have faced the emergence of foreign terrorists in our region. We hope that the CSTO-led efforts aimed at helping friendly Kazakhstan will contribute to resuming normal life there as soon as possible. Colleagues, importantly, the key priorities of our chairmanship include strengthening the organisation's crisis response mechanisms. Based on this, we expect the CSTO member states to step up their cooperative efforts to further improve these mechanisms, which, undoubtedly, would serve both the further development of interaction between the member states and the strengthening of the organisation's corresponding entities and mechanisms. Colleagues, We have completed the exchange of views on today's agenda. Summing up the results of today's session, I would like to state with satisfaction the high level of mutual understanding between our countries regarding the situation in Kazakhstan. The purposefulness of our actions towards the earliest possible stabilisation of the situation in Kazakhstan and the return to normal life there is obvious. This is a critical moment for ensuring basic living conditions for its citizens, as well as ensuring the security of the strategic facilities. Thank you. I think our session can be considered over now. Thank you. Please, Mr Putin. Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much, Mr Pashinyan. You know, I would like to close by making a couple of points. First, there is a very high level of interaction and a willingness of our colleagues to work – in the full sense of the word – at any time of day or night. This is what we have seen in the course of the events that are still unfolding. This, of course, is the result of the high level of trust that has developed between us over our years of cooperation. I think all our meetings, including informal ones, and the last meeting in St Petersburg in late 2021 also confirmed the fact that our contacts are beneficial for us and strengthen our interaction. Of course, I would like to thank everyone for this. This is my first point. Second, we need to think about improving the decision-making procedures for the use of joint forces. Our recent decisions were made quickly, but I think they need to be uniform as it would improve the quality of our work, raise it up a notch and make our work even more efficient, even though, in general, we have nothing to complain about. And the third issue, which does not concern all our colleagues. I would like to say just a few words on current issues over the telephone to Mr Rakhmon immediately after the meeting. If you do not have urgent matters at hand, I would like to call you right after the end of our session. Nikol Pashinyan: Thank you, Mr President. Goodbye. All the best."

The Russian Orthodox Church, as well as other Christian denominations make extensive and truly selfless efforts to preserve our immense historical, patriotic and cultural legacy, to strengthen the institution of the family, and educate young people. Their interaction with state and public organisations is developing and inter-faith dialogue is improving, with particular attention paid to social service as well as to charitable and educational initiatives. Such important and comprehensive activity deserves sincere recognition. I wish all Orthodox Christians and everybody who is celebrating Christmas good health, success and happiness.""*** On Christmas Eve, Vladimir Putin attended services at the Church of the Mandylion in Novo-Ogaryovo."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67555,Meeting with Almaz-Antey Corporation General Designer Pavel Sozinov,2022-01-05T13:40:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region",The President met with General Designer of Almaz-Antey Aerospace Defence Concern Pavel Sozinov.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon. Mr Sozinov, Almaz-Antey needs no additional introduction. The company's products are well-known all over the world. Air defence systems are the world's most reliable and most in-demand arms on the global market. This is a universally recognised fact. But I would like to start with something different– the non-military part, the civilian goods that you have begun to produce, with a planned increase in production, keeping in mind that, in general, in 20 years the company has not only actively consolidated all options in the sphere that you are involved in, but has increased them many times over. And we will discuss that today too. Please. General Designer of Almaz-Antey Aerospace Defence Concern Pavel Sozinov: We are indeed celebrating our 20th anniversary this April, bearing in mind the Executive Order you signed in 2002, accordingly, we can discuss specific results and further plans including civilian produce. As of today, the technologies that were predominantly developed over the last 10–15 years for military products turned out to be in demand for civilian products and we continue to develop both assembly operations and process solutions. I would like to highlight, first and foremost, that a significant part, around 30 percent of the 140,000 employees of the concern's enterprises(22 regions are covered by our concern) are involved in civilian production and this number continues to grow. Vladimir Putin: And what is the total number of employees? Pavel Sozinov: It is 140,000. Therefore, a key element amidst specific restrictions, including export orders for armaments and military vehicles, is that we are forced to search for civilian products, including those that meet the needs of other countries rather than just the Russian Federation, and to seek partners and consumers abroad. Not only the'near abroad', as it is common to say, but in the'far abroad' as well. Primarily, this relates to air traffic control. In keeping with your Executive Order, over the past few years we have completed the core elements of the programme to overhaul this system in the Russian Federation. Most airport areas received new equipment. Thus, we have been able to upgrade all electronic equipment used in these systems with products made in Russia in a relatively short period– a little over 12 years. Moreover, we reduced our reliance on third-party solutions supplied by entities that used to operate in this segment, including during the Soviet era. We did not have any problems regarding third-party equipment. Developing weather radars for meteorological services, including for weather agencies, as well as other entities, was our second focus area. Over the past eight years, we delivered about 200 radio locators of this class to customers in the Russian Federation, and exported quite a few devices of this kind. There is great demand for these products. These are research-intensive devices, which is also important. Medical equipment is another civilian segment we are working into. This has always been a research-intensive segment. Even today, we already have the required quality certifications for a number of products and supply medical equipment to several health facilities. I would like to emphasise that today we offer a full range of X-ray devices and systems, which can completely cover the needs of the healthcare systems of the Russian Federation and the former Soviet republics. Essentially, we could fully cover the sector's demand if we received the corresponding orders. Vladimir Putin: How are your relations with the Ministry of Healthcare and other agencies? Pavel Sozinov: This is quite a complicated relationship, which is understandable, because in some cases we have comprehensive contracts, under which specific products have to be offered as part of a product package, rather than separately. Quite often, a tender is held to purchase a large number of equipment items and gear. For example, this can be just X-ray machines, but the tender includes many other items that we do not make, while somebody else does. Of course, it is not uncommon for foreign producers to take part in these tenders, which complicates things. Vladimir Putin: There is nothing complicated about this. This may be a challenge for you, but not for those who place these orders. We need to discuss this matter separately. Pavel Sozinov: Yes, this is a topical matter indeed. We have been proactive in developing another civilian segment over the past two years, taking into account the fact that we have built a major high-precision mechanical processing factory in Nizhny Novgorod. You attended the opening ceremony of the Nizhny Novgorod 70th Anniversary of Victory Plant. Today, we have filled most of its order book with the development and production of complex solutions for Gazprom, including for deep-water devices and hydrocarbon extraction. All this amounts to re-engineering our capabilities. We have been promoting import substitution as per the technical specifications Gazprom sends us. Overall, we already have eight projects involving high-end technology devices and units. If everything goes as planned in the next 12 to 18 months, there could be a substantial, up to tenfold increase in Gazprom's orders, so much of our production capabilities dealing with mechanical processing, metal plating and so forth will be taken up by these orders. Finally, making certain types of mini and micro aerial and ground vehicles is another important segment in today's world. I am talking about drones, which have been such a hit lately. The Defence Ministry uses them for some of its purposes, but they can be used quite broadly and by other agencies as well, not only for traffic management purposes, but also as a civilian product, including as household goods. Will the law provide for this option? I do hope that this will be the case. For this reason, we are already designing an air traffic control system for UAVs covering large territories, including remote locations in Siberia, in Russia's Far East, and so forth. These basic technical solutions can be embedded not only in ground infrastructure, but also into drone elements to be used for urgent deliveries of medical supplies, goods and anything else to remote locations across Russia. I hope that this segment will benefit from all-round support. That said, this is only one side of the coin. The other side of the coin is that we see quite a lucrative market for these products in the Russian Federation, as well as in former Soviet republics. From a technology perspective, we are ready to make systems and devices of this kind. We have everything we need for this here in Russia. These are the main points I wanted to cover. Of course, we have many more products, but these are the key, systemic, cutting-edge solutions. Vladimir Putin: Have you been able to meet the market demand, or have you been focusing on covering the Defence Ministry's needs, while the global market comes only after that? To what extent do your capabilities match the market demand? Pavel Sozinov: Today, we have to acknowledge that 40 percent of our production capacity in high-end radioelectronics, radio locators, radio communications and related equipment has been underutilised. This means that we can add a substantial number of other products, including for the defence industry, as well as civilian goods. There is nothing extraordinary about this. As I have already said, unfortunately, defence exports decreased significantly compared to the previous years, and we have to take this into consideration. Therefore, we are ready to develop this segment. Vladimir Putin: Good. I suggest that we discuss social matters now. Pavel Sozinov: As for social matters, we have been working on two fronts. The first one is related to the fact that more people are eager to work for us, including young specialists. Within our company, we have a science and educational centre for this purpose. It works under the so-called distributed model, with its headquarters in Moscow. We have our own departments or dedicated laboratories at major universities in all our core regions of presence, coupled with our science and educational centre that offers remote learning opportunities, among other things. This year, about two and a half thousand people are enrolled in supplementary education courses. They have some basic schooling and have worked for some time at our enterprises, but can now receive new knowledge and skills for designing high-end electronics and other systems. This is an important magnet for attracting specialists. The second front is that we offer post-graduate degrees and have dissertation boards. This also attracts people who want to specialise in specific disciplines and do research. This deals primarily with radiolocation, radio communications, etc. In fact, apart from operating departments within the leading Russian universities, we run dissertation boards in all the key disciplines for post-graduate students. Of course, average salaries vary greatly from one region to another. Nevertheless, we have reached an average level of 120,000 to 130,000 rubles for the core engineering and design entities. We have set this standard for the engineering staff. As for our manufacturing sites, including the main production facilities and their workers, we are also approaching this level. Unfortunately, the picture gets a little worse once you count in the non-essential personnel, since it all depends on whether enterprises operate at full capacity. Sometimes there is not enough work to fill a shift. We have to reassign people to other tasks, and then move them back, which is quite a headache for us. Overall, there have not been any substantial staff redundancies despite a certain decline in orders. What we do is redistribute orders and reassign people within enterprises in order to address this issue on a systemic basis. I would like to note right away that no single entity could have done this on its own. We shift our workforce within our group, and even work with other conglomerates on staff exchanges. If a company has many orders, we can send our employees there to carry out urgently needed work. Vladimir Putin: Have you been able to help people with housing? Pavel Sozinov: We do help people with housing. This is quite a challenge in Moscow, while the situation is slightly better in Moscow Region and Yekaterinburg. In fact, we have a programme for helping young specialists and essential workers get housing. We co-finance housing transactions or cover mortgage payments in full or in part. Having worked for us for some time, an employee becomes entitled to the corresponding compensation. In some cases, we buy apartments ourselves, and employees later pay us back from the bonuses they get, and so forth. In principle, we use these methods at the corporate level and in specific entities. There are also other, more proactive youth outreach methods, including various competitions for the best engineers, the best projects, and the like. This is also quite an effective tool. Sometimes it is even more effective than trying to deliver on a certain task head-on. Creating ad hoc teams is also quite an effective tool. There is one last thing I wanted to mention regarding our staff. Today, at our enterprises, as well as in the design bureaus, we have the workforce and all the equipment we need for delivering on the design tasks we have, from microelectronics to large-scale systems. I am referring to computer-aided design systems. I have to say that we do have our own, in-house solutions. This is something we did not have before, but now we have computer-aided design systems for developing radiolocation devices, to give you an example. We intend to develop a similar solution for missile construction. These are very important things that we did not have before. Only Raytheon and Lockheed Martin currently have solutions of this kind, and no one else does. This is where we are aiming, and have been quite successful at it, by the way. I believe that this factor also attracts some specialists who want to try unconventional ways of delivering on technological and project tasks. Vladimir Putin: How many enterprises formed the corporation's core in its early days? Pavel Sozinov: At the outset, there were 46 entities employing some 60,000 people. Today, as I have already said, we have 140,000 people across 136 enterprises in 22 regions. Quite an increase, in fact. This enabled us to cover many areas of expertise over this time, including aerospace defence systems, and all the related equipment from space-based systems to very short-range locators, etc. Vladimir Putin: How effective is your corporate governance? Pavel Sozinov: I believe that our corporate governance system is well-equipped for operating in the current environment. We decided not to create any major sub-holding structures. In fact, we have a top-down management system for all the enterprises within our conglomerate. Apart from the official bodies like the board of directors, we also have councils for dealing with specific matters, formed by the leading designers and engineers, as well as scientific-technical councils for finding solutions to issues that may arise during our in-house or external collaborations. In most cases, we do not even have to bring in managers or senior executives, or reach out to the Ministry of Industry and Trade. Overall, we have the expertise to deliver on most of these objectives, except maybe for those that do not depend on us, such as third-party supplies, etc. Vladimir Putin: Very well. Thank you."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67554,Meeting with Director General of Tactical Missiles Corporation Boris Obnosov,2022-01-04T14:00:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region",Vladimir Putin held a meeting with Director General of Tactical Missiles Corporation Boris Obnosov.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your corporation is marking its 20th anniversary in January. Director General of Tactical Missiles Corporation Boris Obnosov: Exactly, it is right around the corner, on January 24. The 20 years since you signed the Executive Order creating our corporation passed so quickly. Vladimir Putin: At the first stage, we succeeded in keeping the main businesses afloat as the core of the future corporation, and built from there. Boris Obnosov: You are right. The first Executive Order covered six enterprises, which enabled us to devise a corporate governance framework, since this was the first corporation of its kind, while Almaz-Antey came afterwards. You issued several other executive orders on our corporation. Today, it is a conglomerate of 38 enterprises with 55,000 employees. We specialise in aircraft armaments, which make up almost 100 percent of our order book, including about 70 percent of naval armaments, and, in part, space weapons. I believe that the corporation has succeeded in saving several enterprises, which would not have survived otherwise. Today, the average salary at our corporation is 65,000 rubles. Of course, it varies from region to region, since some joined the corporation earlier than others. Still, the average stands at 65,000 rubles, which enables us to deliver on our social mission quite effectively. Mr President, I wanted to draw your attention to the fact that many of our production sites have redundant space. As we upgrade and retool our industrial facilities, we have repurposed some of them for civilian construction. In fact, this amounts to building social housing, since we sell these properties at face value. For example, in Ryazan Region we have built an apartment block recently where a square metre costs 29,000 rubles. Considering that people earn 70,000 rubles per month, on average, it is quite understandable that… After all, their offices are just a two-minute walk from their new homes. This way people can make better use of their free time after work, and be more productive at work. We have been building housing along the same lines in Orenburg, Korolyov, Reutov, and are about to finish building an apartment block in Perm. The pace of construction depends on the region. Of course, there is the matter of streamlining procedures related to repurposing areas for civilian construction, especially when we do this for our own employees. After all, the paperwork is quite a challenging process, so I will refrain from sharing with you how long it takes to do that. Most importantly, over these years we have completely retrofitted and upgraded our facilities, thanks to the support from the state under comprehensive targeted programmes for the defence industry, as well as those carried out by the Ministry of Industry and Trade. For example, you would not recognise the Detal Ural Design Bureau in Kamensk-Uralsk. This is our main production site for making target-seeking devices. It also makes altimeters for all our aircraft. I used to call this plant a bedding factory, but today I am proud of it. The average employee there is 37 years old, and people are eager to work there. This really makes me happy. The same applies to Strela in Orenburg: 7,000 people work there, and the factory has been completely retooled and upgraded, and contributes to all our major projects you have been mentioning in your statements, so it is well known. Speaking of our accomplishments over these years, I have to say that not only did we deliver on our social mission, but most importantly, we succeeded in enhancing our country's defence capabilities by developing over 20 various types of weapons, which passed state trials and came into service. We have quite a long order book for exports. A joint venture like BrahMos is probably known not only in Russia, but around the world. I do believe that this is a good example of two countries working together to each other's benefit. This is what I can say about the current state of our corporation. Vladimir Putin: What about research and development? Boris Obnosov: As for research and development, we have been paying a lot of attention to training lately, which includes not only university students, but also schoolchildren. In fact, we have been doing this for the past decade, or even 15 years. Each of our enterprises works with several schools in its city of presence. We have a very strong department at the Moscow Aviation Institute, where we train students in our field of expertise. We also have an entire faculty in Reutov within the Bauman Moscow State Technical University, and several departments within this university. Every production facility, be it in Perm, Omsk or Orenburg, has its own department at universities and institutes of the corresponding region. This has enabled us to attract many young engineers. I have to tell you that over the past five years we have noticed that young people have been eager to become engineers. This is my personal opinion, but I do know what I am talking about, because I also teach. This used to be our weakest spot, since in the 1990s, as you know, there was this major gap with the older generation, since many left during the years of perestroika and, should I say, the power vacuum. Today, people want to work for us, and importantly, there are still people around who can guide them. After all, we have been paying a lot of attention to keeping the family traditions alive. Taking this opportunity, I would like to note that you visited us back in 2007, and I remember this meeting very well. If you find some time to spend with us, I would like to reiterate that by visiting our core production site you would be able to see for yourself what we have accomplished over the past 15 years. We have upgraded our procurement and warehousing facilities. We used to have single-storey structures spread across our territory serving as our warehouses. They took up a lot of space, but now we brought them together within a single building with a floor space of 18,000 square metres. This is where we also installed our automated cutting equipment, which greatly improves labour efficiency. This has enabled us to make it into the top 50 global defence enterprises for the past five years, according to the Defence News annual ranking. This means that considering our headcount we have maintained labour efficiency at a good level. In fact, there has been a consistent increase in output per employee. To give you a number, the annual figure is over 6,000,000 rubles per employee, which is quite a solid performance. Vladimir Putin: Developing the civilian component is quite a challenge for you, but still, how are you doing in this regard? Boris Obnosov: Indeed, I even joke sometimes, among other things, that making reusable missiles is quite a daunting task. However, you may remember your visit to the MAKS Aviation and Space Salon two years ago, together with President Erdogan of Turkey. We were showing a human skeleton with joints made from composite materials. In fact, usually these joints are made from titanium, but it has a limited period of use, and it is harder to implant it into human tissue. Today, we have certified this product, and are preparing a production facility for making these joints. We believe this to be a very promising market niche. In addition to this, take the Avangard manufacturing site in Safonovo. They are also proactive in using composite materials. Today, we make several types of pipe for heating stations from composite materials to replace brick structures that wear out much faster. I believe this to be a very promising market. At the Strela factory in Orenburg we created a corporation-level tooling centre. It already has many customers. This means that instead of importing tools, we make them in Russia and offer them two or three times cheaper compared to foreign tools. This is a very important line of business for us. There are examples of this kind for every enterprise within our corporation. We have made significant progress on medical equipment, as I have already said. Today, we are exploring opportunities for making civilian drones, among other things, to use them as taxis and for deliveries, including the delivery of goods. In all, I believe that by 2025, civilian goods will make up 30, or rather 28 percent of our portfolio. And when I promise something, I always make sure that I can actually deliver on it. Vladimir Putin: Very well. Thank you very much."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67514,New Year Address to the Nation,2021-12-31T23:55:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Citizens of Russia, friends, The year 2021 is drawing to a close. Very soon, time will take us from the past into the future. True, this is something that happens every day, minute and second. But we hear this continuous passage of time most clearly when we welcome the New Year and look forward to it as an important marker in our lives. We are united in the hope that changes for the better lie ahead. But we know that they cannot be detached or isolated from the events that unfolded in the outgoing year. We faced enormous challenges, but we learned to live in these harsh circumstances and solve complex problems. Our solidarity made this possible. Together, we continued to combat the dangerous pandemic sweeping every continent, which shows no signs of receding. This elusive disease claimed tens of thousands of lives. Everyone who lost loved ones, please accept my words of sincere support. Friends, Most importantly, we worked together to overcome the difficulties of the outgoing year. We stood up for those in need. First and foremost, we supported senior citizens and families with children who are the future of Russia. We acted resolutely and consistently to uphold our national interests and the security of the country and our citizens. We took swift action to restore the economy and in many areas we are close to achieving our strategic development objectives. Of course, many issues remain unresolved. But we did well this year. Most of the credit goes to you, the citizens of Russia. This is the result of your hard work, friends. Everyone in their own way strove to do their duty, to do even more than seemed possible, and to help those who had it particularly hard. My heartfelt thanks go to all of you. In challenging times like these, it is particularly important to be creative and committed to your plans no matter what, while working for the benefit of society and your native country. As we ring in the New Year, we hope that it will bring new opportunities for us. Of course, we hope luck will be on our side, but we understand that making our dreams reality primarily depends on us, on what we prioritise in our daily lives, on our ability to commit to our projects and achieve concrete, tangible results. These results will be the stepping stones towards the successful implementation of our national plans. Their main goal is to improve the well-being and quality of life of the people. Achieving these goals will make Russia even stronger, and we will be able to ensure the continued progress and prosperity of our Motherland only if we are in it together. Friends, New Year's Eve is literally filled with good cheer and happy thoughts, as we all try to put our best foot forward. This openness and generosity are the spirit of this wonderful holiday, when it is so important to warm parents' hearts with kindness and loving care, to hug them if they are near you, and to tell everyone around you how dear they are to you and that happiness is all about love, children, family, and friends. These are the important values that largely determine the meaning of each person's life. We all want them to remain a reliable pillar of strength supporting us in the coming year. This is the time to share our innermost feelings for the people who are near and dear to us, to speak those sincere words of love and gratitude which we do not always have enough time for in our busy lives. But the real magic of the New Year is that it opens our hearts to empathy and trust, generosity and mercy. Wherever you may be during these minutes– with your family and friends, or in the squares of your beloved cities– you will hear these warm and sincere wishes. I am pleased to join in these wishes, and to wish a Happy New Year to those who serve in the military or another capacity, who take care of the ill, who are on active duty at their combat post or enforcing law and order. The operation of major transport routes and a large number of plants and critical services goes on interrupted. Hundreds of thousands of our citizens are employed in these efforts. Thank you for your responsible work which is so important for the country and society. Friends, The New Year is about to begin in a few seconds. Many families, including our compatriots outside Russia, will offer the traditional New Year toast:""Happy New Year! May it be filled with new fortune!"" These simple words have a special meaning to us, because they are passed down from generation to generation. My sincere best wishes, and above all for good health! From that, success in your work, studies, creative endeavours and favourite pursuits will follow. May every home have as many joyful moments as possible. May there be new families with new children. May they grow up to be healthy and intelligent, honest and free. May love fill every heart and inspire us all to achieve our goals and scale the greatest heights. For the sake of our loved ones and for the sake of our only country, our great Motherland. Happy New Year, friends! Happy 2022!"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67487,Telephone conversations with US President Joseph Biden,2021-12-31T02:20:00Z,NA,"On December 30, Vladimir Putin had a telephone conversation with President of the Untied States of America Joseph Biden.","The conversation focused on the implementation of the agreement to launch negotiations on providing Russia with legally binding security guarantees, reached during the December 7 videoconference to launch negotiations on providing Russia with legally binding security guarantees. Vladimir Putin detailed the fundamental approaches underlying the Russian drafts of the Treaty between the Russian Federation and the United States of America and the Agreement between the Russian Federation and the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. He stressed that the negotiations needed to produce solid legally binding guarantees ruling out NATO's eastward expansion and the deployment of weapons that threaten Russia in the immediate vicinity of its borders. Vladimir Putin further emphasised that the security of any nation cannot be ensured unless the principle of indivisible security is strictly observed. Both leaders expressed willingness to engage in a serious and substantive dialogue on these issues. It was confirmed that the negotiations would take place first in Geneva on January 9–10 and then as part of the Russia-NATO Council in Brussels on January 12. Negotiations are also to be held at the OSCE on January 13. The presidents agreed to personally supervise these negotiating tracks, especially bilateral, with a focus on reaching results quickly. In this context, Joseph Biden emphasised that Russia and the US shared a special responsibility for ensuring stability in Europe and the whole world and that Washington had no intention of deploying offensive strike weapons in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin gave an exhaustive response to the mention once again by Joseph Biden of the possibility of imposing ""large-scale"" sanctions in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine. He suggested that this would be a grave error, de facto fraught with the danger of a complete breakdown in Russia-US relations. The presidents exchanged New Year greetings and best wishes. Overall, the conversation took place in a frank and business-like atmosphere and it was certainly of benefit to both parties. The leaders agreed to continue regular contacts at the highest level."

Since then, the Fund has done a great deal, has come a long way and has attracted considerable funds to the national economy. You have established partner ties with many sovereign funds around the world, as well as with private funds. You have recently been doing a great deal to promote the Sputnik V vaccine abroad, and you can report good results. Let us talk about all these issues in detail, one after another, and also about your plans for the future. Russian Direct Investment Fund CEO Kirill Dmitriev Dmitriev KirillCEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund(RDIF): Mr President, thank you very much. First of all, I would like to present a book published for our 10th anniversary, which describes over one hundred of the Fund's projects, and to thank you for supporting the Russian Direct Investment Fund and for meeting with our partners regularly. It is thanks to your support that we can make large investments in the key economic sectors. Over the past period, we have invested over 2 trillion rubles together with our partners, who invested 9 rubles per 1 ruble of the Fund's investment. We have attracted US$40 billion to joint funds, out of which US$4 billion have been provided by the automatic investors, who are investing their money together with us. We have also created 100,000 jobs in Russia. Consequently, our profitability is higher compared to many other indices. The Fund is working well, thanks to your support. We are focused on six main sectors, where you have instructed us to invest. First, we invest in improving the quality of life. A relevant example is the Mother and Child clinic, which has increased the number of regions where it is working from 3 to 25, opened 40 new medical centres and created over 7,000 jobs. As many as 40,000 babies have been born there over the past decade. Second, we are improving infrastructure, for example, a railway bridge between Russia and China, the first railway bridge, which has shortened the route by 700 kilometres and increased the throughput capacity by 54 percent. Another major infrastructure project is, of course, the Central Ring Road. Speaking of import substitution, we increased the capacity of the liquefied petroleum gas terminal in Ust-Luga by 30 percent. Turning to the development of the Russian regions, there is the issue of the digital divide. Together with Rostelecom, we provided internet access to 3.5 million Russians. To conclude, I would like to mention efforts to improve the efficiency of Russian companies. In this regard, we built PLT, a logistics company, from the ground up, and it is now one of the top three logistics companies in Russia. As for technological development, there was also a lot of investment here, for example in Doctis, a leading telemedicine provider. Therefore, we have been proactive on all six fronts as per your instructions and created companies that work to Russia's benefit. In addition, many of our partners have never invested in Russia before but have now turned into major investors. Saudi Arabia has already invested in 40 projects with us, the United Arab Emirates invested in 65 projects, and China in 40 projects. Once again, it is thanks to your support that many of our investors have proactively co-invested in these projects. Vladimir Putin: What about Sputnik? Kirill Dmitriev: We have gone to great lengths to promote Sputnik. The data on its effectiveness indicates that this is the best vaccine in the world. Hungary has recently published data showing Sputnik is ahead of all other vaccines in terms of preventing COVID-19 deaths. People vaccinated with Sputnik are 130 times better protected against death from COVID than the unvaccinated and several times better than people with other vaccines. It is also important that Sputnik, including Sputnik Light, are effective boosters and offer increased protection, including in the case of the American mRNA vaccines, which remain effective for only a short period. Most importantly, according to the latest data, Sputnik is quite effective against the Omicron variant, and the reduction in vaccine effectiveness is much lower compared to foreign vaccines, while Sputnik Light greatly enhances protection. For these reasons, we believe that Sputnik is the most effective vaccine in the world for fighting the Omicron variant. Vladimir Putin: Good. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67466,Meeting on heating season,2021-12-29T18:15:00Z,St Petersburg,"The President held a meeting, via videoconference, on the autumn-winter heating season.","The meeting was attended by Presidential Aide Maxim Oreshkin, Energy Minister Nikolai Shulginov, Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller, and Director General of Rosseti Andrei Ryumin. * * * Excerpts from transcript of meeting on the autumn-winter heating season President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues. The New Year holidays are approaching and by tradition, many of our people will spend them at home, with their families and friends. All of us understand how important it is to ensure, during these long holidays, the reliable, failsafe operation of all housing and utility companies, continuous production cycle businesses, transport, and many other economic and social branches that provide services for the daily life of our cities and villages. Today, I suggest discussing in detail how the national energy complex copes with peak loads. This year it is taking place against the backdrop of economic recovery and increasing energy consumption. In December, this indicator hit a historical high. I would like to note that in general the national energy complex is working steadily. That said – I must put it straight – far from all regions keep their grids and equipment in proper condition. Meanwhile, before the start of the heating season, we discussed this situation many times, and I was assured that everything was in excellent shape everywhere. As usual, there are setbacks: some constituent entities of the Federation are facing difficulties in the operation of their housing and utility sectors and require additional material and human resources. During the news conference last week, a journalist from Buryatia spoke about a major utility accident in Ulan-Ude. True, a fire at a station triggered it, but it was still an accident. Because of this emergency, many city residents were left without hot water and heating. I know that the regional authorities and relevant companies are doing all they can to eliminate the consequences of this accident. At the same time, it is obvious that the federal authorities must also keep this issue under their permanent control. I would like to hear what measures to help Buryatia have been taken and what the plan is for them. One more point. Another journalist, from Daghestan, said during the news conference that the region's energy companies are failing to meet the needs of the regional economy and social sphere. I know they have a tangle of longstanding problems such as low payment discipline, a non-transparent and ineffective structure of ownership of generating facilities and grids. I would also like to ask you to specifically look into this problem today. Again, it is our most important responsibility to make sure that every flat and house, industrial and social facility across the country, every city and community is reliably supplied with heat and electricity. We need to ensure that the housing and utilities system works smoothly and accurately, especially in winter, during low temperatures, that energy resources are supplied regularly, predictably and at affordable prices. By the way, unfortunately, this is far from the case today in many countries. The situation in the housing and utilities sector is primarily the responsibility of the regions and municipalities, and it is clear why. This industry is huge, and it is better to monitor locally the state of the heating and power grids, generating facilities, boiler houses, etc., to check what sections should be put into operation and when and what needs to be repaired in time. At the same time, I would like to point out that the relevant federal ministry and the Government also need to constantly monitor the hands-on situation in the regions. Consumers do not have to care whose responsibility it is – it is important that everything functions properly, especially in those places where the climate is the most severe. In those climates, any accident or abnormal situation can have the most serious consequences. It is extremely important to respond to emergencies quickly, as quickly as possible, to help our colleagues in the regions deal with any problem that might emerge. Today I ask you to report on the tools and mechanisms you propose to employ in emergencies, as well as on your systemic work that is being done to improve the reliability of energy distribution. In this regard, let me remind you that housing and utility upgrades are among the key projects eligible for the easy-term infrastructure loans we provide to the regions. I would like to close my opening remarks with yet another important matter. As you are aware, steady gas supply to the domestic market is our top priority when it comes to expanding gas infrastructure in our country, which is why major gas infrastructure development projects are underway in the regions. Residents of communities with pipeline gas availability will have gas brought to their houses before the end of 2022, as agreed. To ensure reliable and stable distribution for the long term, the domestic fuel and energy companies are carrying out long-term development plans and developing new fields. Given the challenging circumstances our foreign partners are now in, Russia can increase gas exports. The first string of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline was filled with technical gas in October. As I understand it – and I want Mr Miller, Gazprom CEO, to cover this in his report – the second string Nord Stream 2 will be filled with gas today. This pipeline's total capacity is 55 billion cubic metres of gas, all supplied to our colleagues in Europe. Again, I would like Mr Miller to cover this in detail. This additional route will undoubtedly help stabilise prices on the European market. I would like you to discuss this at the meeting today as well as the overall situation in Europe, because our main consumers are in Europe. Let's move on to discussing the issues under review. <…> Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller: Mr President, Ensuring a successful heating season in Russia is Gazprom's main task. Prior to pumping gas from underground storage facilities, we had 72.638 billion cubic metres of reserve gas. It is possible to pump 847.9 million cubic metres daily. Reserve gas volumes and daily pumping capacities have hit an all-time high in this country. There was a steep drop in ambient temperatures in Russia from the second week of December. On December 23, the average temperature was minus 17 degrees Celsius in all regions covered by the Unified Gas Supply System. This is 9.3 degrees lower than the average seasonal level. These days gas supplies to Russian consumers on the domestic market and the pumping of gas from the country's underground gas reservoirs have reached an all-time high for the last 10 years since 2012. At the same time, Gazprom has, as always, reliably supplied gas to Russian consumers and to our customers abroad, and it continues to do so. We completely fulfil our export contact obligations under long-term bilateral contracts in accordance with specific requests. As of today, 12.36 billion cubic metres of gas, or 17 percent of all reserve gas, have been pumped from Russia's underground storage facilities which are now filled to 83 percent of their capacity. Mr President, as per your instruction, Gazprom pumped its own gas into Europe's underground reservoirs throughout November and December. In late December, the volume of gas involved will total one billion cubic metres. On December 21–25, European operators pumped record-breaking volumes of gas from underground European reservoirs, reaching the highest levels for many years. Today, Europe's underground reservoirs have been depleted by 44 percent, and those of Germany, by 47 percent. At the same time, it should be noted that reserve gas volumes in Europe's underground reservoirs are 21 billion cubic metres less than for the same period in 2020. They are 28 percent or almost one-third lower. Underground reservoirs have a substantial shortage of gas, and this continues to have a serious impact on the European gas market. Gazprom has completely fulfilled its obligations under a contract to pump gas via Ukrainian territory. We were to pump 40 billion cubic metres of gas, and we have already pumped 41.5 billion cubic metres of gas via Ukraine. On December 24, Ukraine's underground reservoirs hit an all-time low in terms of reserve gas volumes. Today, Ukraine holds less than 14 billion cubic metres of gas reserves, which is ten billion less than it had in late December 2020. Mr President, today at 12.58 pm Moscow time Gazprom completed filling the second string of Nord Stream 2, and now both legs of the pipeline are at the operating pressure and ready to go. The Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline has a design capacity of 55 billion cubic metres per year and is the longest offshore gas pipeline in the world, at 1,234 kilometres. Mr President, the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is ready for operation. <…> Vladimir Putin: I would like to congratulate Gazprom and your Nord Stream 2 partners on the completion of this project to build this large additional pipeline and on this pipeline being ready for operation. Now the start is up to our partners, consumers in Europe, in Germany. As soon as they make the decision on the launch of operation, a large additional amount of Russian gas will immediately begin to flow towards Europe. Let me remind you that we are talking about 55 billion cubic metres a year. By the way, this should immediately affect the price on the market, on the spot market. And all those countries and consumers of Russian gas are bound to feel it right away. This applies to businesses and households alike. Even in Ukraine, this should shift prices downward, because they buy a significant amount of Russia-produced gas at European market prices, which are fairly high – $1,000 or more, $1,000 per 1,000 cubic metres. This will immediately influence the prices in a country like Ukraine, which, for political reasons, unfortunately, refuses to buy gas directly from Russia and has to pay such a high price because of this. But if the Nord Stream begins operation, it will also have a positive effect on prices for a country like Ukraine. But again, now it is our European partners' turn to act, and it is up to them. We have completed a project to develop this additional gas transportation route with our partners, by the way, European companies, with five European companies. Nord Stream 2 is ready to go. So much for our exports. I would like to return to where we started, back to the matters that brought us together today. We need to make sure that Russia goes through the period of the lowest temperatures safely and reliably, without any failures. We know that certain disruptions are inevitable in such cold weather as we observe today. As long as the response is instantaneous, and all repairs are performed as quickly as possible and with high quality, people will not feel any disruptions in the energy system's operation. I would like to ask Mr Maxim Oreshkin and his colleagues to prepare draft instructions following this meeting. Happy New Year, everyone! Goodbye, and all the best."

President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko took part in the ceremony. Later the same day Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko took part in a friendly hockey match held on the ice rink of the Manezh sports school in Strelna. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, good afternoon! Of course, first of all, I would like to congratulate you on the coming New Year. But we are here for a different reason. First, of course, we will play today as we have agreed. And I have something to say at the beginning of the ceremony. The names Yakushev, Kasatonov and Kamensky are very well-known by all fans in Russia and the former Soviet Union – all of them. A big fan of yours from the former Soviet Union is also here today after our today's meeting: President Alexander Lukashenko wished to attend this ceremony. I would like to say that we are not here just as sports fans, we know you very well. We know all your achievements, know how you fought for the honour of our country, how you won the highest awards and how outstanding you were, fighting until the end and winning. On behalf of all hockey fans and sport enthusiasts in Russia, I would like to congratulate you on receiving state decorations. I would like to once again thank you for everything you have done and everything you are doing today. I mean popularising sports and ice hockey in particular and taking part in the activities of the Night Hockey League and developing this wonderful sport. You know how popular it is today not only among people who like hockey but among everyone who follows the development of fitness and sport. You motivate tens of thousands of people with this love. This is very important for every country, and for Russia, too, of course, in no small way. Thank you very much. Congratulations. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67465,Meeting with President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko,2021-12-29T16:35:00Z,St Petersburg,Vladimir Putin met with President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko at the Constantine Palace.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Lukashenko, Thank you for staying for our bilateral meeting after the CIS events held yesterday. For me, yesterday's meetings were very productive. We discussed a whole number of areas for expanding relations with the CIS countries. Today, we will be able to discuss bilateral relations between Russia and Belarus, as well as the results of building the Union State, in a calm manner, without any rush. Indeed, we have made substantial headway this year, while coordinating our positions on key aspects. We have approved 28 programmes for the Union State development. These key elements might not be noticeable at first, but they are quite substantial in the context of expanding modern international and close integration processes between both states. First, this concerns financial matters, taxation, customs and fiscal legislation. This is very important; it will create better conditions for developing the economy of both countries. Unfortunately, bilateral trade volumes dropped by almost 17 percent during the 2020 pandemic, but they rebounded and grew by almost 36 percent this year. In effect, we have compensated for our 2020 losses… President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko Lukashenko AlexanderPresident of Belarus: And we have added more. Vladimir Putin: And we have added almost twice as much. In this connection, I believe we should thank our colleagues from the Government of Russia and the Government of Belarus. We have serious plans for implementing our interaction. You and I have been talking for almost 60 minutes, and we will continue this discussion at lunch. I would also like to thank you for invariably supporting these processes, and I hope that we will continue to maintain the same productive cooperation in 2022, as well. Alexander Lukashenko: Thank you, Mr President. I share your positive assessment of yesterday's event. It may have been an informal meeting, but we were still able to discuss matters of principle, including subjects where there has been a lack of progress, such as humanitarian matters related to science, the Russian language, and so forth. It was quite a pleasant surprise that all our colleagues supported your proposals on the humanitarian agenda. I believe you will share this information with your people when the time comes. This was a positive event, held in an atmosphere of kindness and warmth. Once again, we saw that the leaders of the post-Soviet republics, including Belarus, have a very keen understanding of the ongoing developments and can see through global politics in all its intricacies, thanks to Russia, of course. Russia has always had to deal with this for all of us, and this time is no exception, but in this way you have showed that we can rely on you. All of us, heads of state, showed that we do understand what is going on, and people in our countries understand this too. Trust me, this generates a unifying momentum in our relations prompting us to resolve the issues we face together. You mentioned our recent agreements on developing the Union State. Our governments created groups for fulfilling these agreements and implementing them in Belarusian and Russian law. We are heading in this direction to ensure that the contours you have outlined become reality. This is what our efforts are all about. Of course, you are aware of the developments in Belarus. I am really grateful, and my gratitude primarily goes personally to you, for what you have done for Belarus, and the support you have given us. It is not my intention to adulate you in any way, but whenever we propose or ask for something, you issue instructions to the right people, and Russian companies, the Russian Government and banks always respond and are ready to support us in these challenging times of sanctions. Belarus is still being strangled: they imposed five sanction packages on us and are talking about a sixth round. Needless to say, these are silly sanctions, and no one needs them. Our trade increased, and so did our GDP this year despite the sanctions and the pandemic, which is by and large due to the Russian Federation and, to a lesser extent, our friends on the international stage. I would like to sincerely thank you for that in public. Make no mistake, no matter the state of our relations, the people of Belarus always pay their debts. I believe that there is still much we can do together. I have been asking you for a long time not to stop our cooperation on the military and defence sectors and the defence industry and move beyond them. You have always supported me in this regard. I asked you not to stop our joint exercises, while also creating training centres for teaching our military to use the latest military equipment we buy from Russia. We are doing this, so the exercises must also carry on. I know that you and your military officials are reviewing my proposals on holding exercises in Belarus. I would like you to decide on this matter. This would benefit Belarus-Russia relations. This goes to say that we are cooperating across the board and will keep doing so. Vladimir Putin: As you suggested, we will hold exercises at the beginning of the year. The military command will coordinate the dates– in March or February– I don't know when they will decide. As for the economy, I would like to note that our experts also believe that the Belarusian economy is in good shape, good financials, as far as I know, you are even going to close with a surplus. So in general, Belarus is a reliable partner for us, not only for political considerations, but based on the economic situation in the real sector of the economy. In this sense, I think we have achieved a lot over the past year, and I hope we will continue this in the next. Alexander Lukashenko: Thank you for supporting our cooperation and import substitution. It turns out we can do a lot. Vladimir Putin: Of course. I think we have taken another good step in giving Belarusian enterprises access to state procurement in Russia. This significantly expands the opportunities for Belarusian companies, and is also beneficial for us, because it increases the level of competition in the market. Alexander Lukashenko: We had better compete with Russian companies. Vladimir Putin: Yes, that's right. The level of internal competition must be maintained. In this sense, this was an informed decision that will benefit both Belarus and Russia. Alexander Lukashenko: We have come to an agreement on– we can say this, we have talked for an hour already– thank you again for supporting the cooperation plans in the aircraft industry. We have both civilian and military aircraft manufacturing plants. We can contribute a lot in terms of cooperation, especially since our products are in demand for the Russian aircraft industry and your new airplane. Vladimir Putin: This will also be one of the instructions for the Government following our meeting. Thank you. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67461,Informal meeting of the CIS heads of state,2021-12-28T14:50:00Z,St Petersburg,St Petersburg hosted the annual informal summit meeting of heads of state of the Commonwealth of Independent States.,"The meeting was attended by President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan, President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko, President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, President of the Kyrgyz Republic Sadyr Japarov, President of the Republic of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon, President of Turkmenistan Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, and President of the Republic of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev, as well as First President of the Republic of Kazakhstan – Leader of the Nation Nursultan Nazarbayev. Anna Popova, Head of the Federal Service for the Oversight of Consumer Protection and Welfare (Rospotrebnadzor) and Chief State Sanitary Physician of the Russian Federation, was also invited to attend the meeting. * * * Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, good afternoon. Allow me to begin by thanking you for accepting my invitation and coming to Russia, to St Petersburg, to attend a meeting which has already become a tradition of sorts. Before the pandemic, we used to come together in St Petersburg ahead of New Year holidays every year. This was a special year for the CIS. Only recently, in December, we marked the organisation's 30th anniversary. I had the pleasure to convey to all of you my greetings on the 30 years of your countries' independence, and now I have the pleasure of doing this in person. It is not usual for us to meet in this format since we mostly hold our meetings online. However, presented with this opportunity, we must use it. I fully agree with you on this point and would like to thank those who initiated this meeting for arranging today's event. We are here in Russia, St Petersburg, but despite this fact almost all of you spoke out, in one way or another, in favour of holding the meeting in this format. We have witnessed monumental shifts over the past years and decades. At the same time, let me note that the very idea of establishing this organisation was justified, there is no doubt about that. We have been deepening our integration in its multiple aspects, including in terms of ensuring national security, and in the economy. I must note the lingering positive impact from the ties we have been sharing since the Soviet era. These are common infrastructure facilities, common businesses that work as partners, chains of creating added value with a high level of cooperation – all this has been preserved and, moreover, developed on an entirely new foundation, a completely new base. This allows us to get through the hard times of the pandemic. All countries in the world have faced it, and this has serious economic and social consequences. However, preserving the opportunities and competitive advantages that we have inherited from the past, we are able to overcome these difficulties much better than many other countries. I must say that we in Russia have supported these relations and will support them in the future. One of the main topics that brought us together at this current meeting, which required a more extensive discussion, as I have already mentioned, is our common efforts to counter the coronavirus pandemic. Our colleagues engage in extensive, practical cooperation every day. This applies to joint scientific activities, the development of medications and preventive drugs, as well as exchanges of test kits and means of overcoming this disease. To start our work, I have invited today Russia's Chief Sanitary Physician, Ms Anna Popova. She heads the Government structure that is in charge of all work in this area and cooperation with our colleagues in all CIS countries. She will share her perspective on where we are on this road, and what, in the opinion of our experts, we should do together in order to make progress in overcoming this problem, the pandemic. Ms Popova, go ahead please. Anna Popova, Head of the Federal Service for the Oversight of Consumer Protection and Welfare (Rospotrebnadzor): Thank you. Mr President, Mr Nazarbayev, leaders of the CIS countries. Epidemiological stability and biological safety in the CIS countries is undoubtedly a condition for the region's sustainable social and economic development. Considering the proximity of our states, the commonality of epidemic threats and the level of integration, one of our key tasks is to build a unified system for epidemic response and relief. The significant advances achieved through biotechnology and synthetic biology are spurring progress in medicine, pharmaceuticals, agriculture and industry. Using modern biotechnology, Russian virologists have developed and registered five COVID-19 vaccines. Russia's Sputnik V was the first vaccine registered in the world, and we have been sharing the benefits with our partners in the Commonwealth of Independent States. Russia has transferred vaccine production technology to other CIS states where production facilities have been built, and the vaccine is being produced. The development of biotechnology and synthetic biology, the availability of tools to modify and create viruses and bacteria also pose risks to biological security. The uncontrolled use of biotechnology can lead to unpredictable consequences. I will give just two examples. In 2016, Canadian virologist [David] Evans brought back to life the extinct equine pox virus from components he purchased online and using some regular equipment – he revived the virus to show the deadliest human smallpox virus, completely eradicated in 1980, can be reconstituted the same way. This year, molecular biologists in the UK have created a bacterium (a bacterium, not a virus, a larger biological entity), Syn61, which is a bacteriophage-proof variant of Escherichia coli. Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria and can be used to treat such diseases. But biotechnology can make it difficult to distinguish between natural and intentional threats to biosafety. Destructive forces are trying to implement a radical reform of the international healthcare system against the backdrop of the pandemic. The goal is to create instruments to influence a policy on biological safety, give international organisations the right to investigate infection or virus outbreaks on states' territories, and introduce mandatory external inspections of their biotechnological potential. A response to these steps requires the consolidated position of the CIS states at the WHO and on BTWC platforms. We have repeatedly discussed these problems. Many countries are increasing their investments in creating laboratories with high biological security. Obviously, investment, personnel, infrastructure, research centres and laboratories are needed for research in molecular epidemiology and to ensure biosafety. The following measures are important for countering the threats to biosafety in the CIS space. First, we must build a common regional system of measures aimed at developing research, providing mutual assistance and exchanging technology and research results. Second, we must ensure independence in technology and research and create our own facilities and laboratories. Third, we must strengthen common mechanisms of preventing and responding to biosafety risks, including deliberate threats. Our countries have a substantial advantage over Soviet times – a powerful sanitary-epidemiological service and science, common approaches to epidemic-prevention measures and a similar personnel-training system. Plus we have a common language of communication. We have already done much to create a common epidemiological space in the CIS countries. We are not starting from scratch. We are upgrading our legislation on biosafety, and the Russian Federation has adopted a law on biosafety. Other CIS countries are also drafting related laws. We are closely cooperating with our colleagues to make these documents effective and use their knowledge for drafting our documents. We have seven bilateral agreements on introducing medical and sanitary rules and four memorandums of understanding on biosafety. The CIS countries are jointly developing warning and response systems for sanitary-epidemiological emergencies. Nineteen programmes to assist the CIS countries have been carried out with support from the Russian Federation over the past 10 years, among them the measles eradication programme, fighting the threat of the transboundary spread of the plague, combatting poliomyelitis, expanding the laboratory network, including mobile labs, fighting HIV, AIDS and all forms of hepatitis, and countering the spread of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. The amount of funds allocated by the Russian Federation for these purposes has exceeded 18 billion rubles over 10 years. In all, over 2,000 pieces of equipment have been supplied to dozens of laboratories, more than 5,000 specialists have been trained, millions of doses of measles and hepatitis vaccines and more than 7 million tests for diagnosing various infections have been donated. These efforts led to ensuring epidemiological safety with regard to many infections. So, amid a surge of measles cases in Europe in 2014–2017, we managed to contain its spread and prevent large outbreaks of measles in the CIS countries. Acting as a team, we have prevented the import and spread of the wild poliovirus in the CIS countries, reduced the incidence of HIV and hepatitis and prevented the transborder spread of dangerous infections, primarily the plague, from natural foci. If you do not mind, I have more to say on this subject. There are 45 natural plague foci in the CIS countries. Thanks to the joint programme funded by the Russian Federation, which was created at your instruction, Mr President, we have managed to ensure complete sanitary and epidemiological plague safety in all our countries over the past four years, despite the annual number of recorded cases of plague in neighbouring countries. There were eight cases in Mongolia, 10 cases in China, and nine cases in the United States, of which almost half were fatal. Plague is a big problem worldwide, however, all natural foci of plague are under control today as a result of our interaction. Since 2017, not a single plague case has been detected in the CIS countries. Mobile laboratories, a network of which is being created in our region, is an effective collaboration tool. Eighteen mobile labs mounted on GAZ trucks and six labs mounted on KAMAZ trucks are operational in six countries. They were donated by Russia over the past five years. These laboratories have a proven track record of countering the novel coronavirus. They are being used for running tests with methodological support from Rospotrebnadzor specialists. We are prepared to continue to support the CIS countries in this regard. The mobile labs' high operational level in the region made it possible, in conjunction with the WHO, to hold the first international exercises with mobile labs of various types with the participation of 120 specialists from eight CIS countries and France, Germany, and Belgium. The exercises were held in Kazan in October, and our labs received high praise from the WHO. The approaches practiced during the exercise will form the basis of international standards for WHO-operated mobile anti-epidemic units. The pandemic has tested the entire region, and demonstrated the value of practical cooperation, mutual assistance, and support among the CIS countries. Russia has consistently been up to the task of fighting the pandemic thanks to its top-down system of governance, proactive response model and ongoing commitment to evidence-based public health measures. Today, Russia ranks 94th in the world by the number of cases per 100,000 people, and in the past week it ranked 72nd, also per 100,000 people. The Russian Federation has had leading indicators in terms of testing coverage practically since the very onset of the pandemic. Today, Russia ranks fourth in terms of overall testing figures. In January 2020, at the instructions of the President of the Russian Federation, Russia was the first country to supply COVID-19 testing kits to the CIS countries. It was with Russian test kits that Kazakhstan, Belarus, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan diagnosed their first covid cases. The Federal Service for the Oversight of Consumer Protection and Welfare and the Health Ministry sent more than 40 expert missions to provide methodological and practical support, as well as train staff to fight COVID-19. My colleagues and I meet regularly via videoconference, almost every two weeks, to discuss current issues and work out solutions. These efforts have yielded results. In 2021, with support from the Russian Government, we launched joint studies on herd immunity to the virus and strain variants and their mutations that were circulating in the CIS member countries. Data obtained from these studies enable us to forecast how the situation will unfold and plan our public health measures. We obtained meaningful results in Belarus and Kyrgyzstan. Studies are already underway in Kazakhstan, while Tajikistan and Armenia are almost ready. Overall, we prepared 14 joint publications, while post-graduate studies are underway in several Russian research institutions. Today, we believe it is important to move to the next phase, which is ensuring regional biosafety, or developing self-sufficient regional infrastructure and joint scientific centres with high-security laboratories. The pandemic has shown the inefficiency of the Western practices of decentralising public health services and dismantling laboratory networks. As a result, several CIS member countries are taking measures to enhance their public health services, create new research centres and revert to earlier approaches that were developed by Soviet science. In Russia, in keeping with the instructions of the Russian President, the Government has developed the ""sanitary shield"" initiative in order to strengthen and update the entire public health monitoring system, including the laboratory infrastructure. This initiative also provides for promoting international cooperation to form a single ""sanitary shield"" across the CIS; this is practically being carried out already, including joint research projects, personnel training and efforts to provide laboratories with equipment. The single ""sanitary shield"" requires developed and self-sufficient infrastructure, including laboratories, research centres and sanitary and quarantine checkpoints created to uniform standards. Drawing on our own experience, we are ready to assist in designing, building and outfitting research centres with laboratories that meet high biosecurity standards, train personnel for them and develop research programmes. We know how to create these types of facilities and how to, among other things, create the necessary conditions for ensuring biosafety and biosecurity, and technological self-sufficiency and operation. In response to requests from our colleagues in Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan, Rospotrebnadzor [the Federal Service for the Oversight of Consumer Protection and Welfare] is providing methodological and consultative support in creating research laboratory complexes. My visits to Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan, organised on behalf of the Russian Government, included substantive talks where we outlined further joint steps. Top officials from those countries' ministries and departments have visited Russian facilities; in December, they visited our flagship facility for responding to especially dangerous infections – the Microbe Russian Plague Research Institute in Saratov. Rospotrebnadzor and the Ministry of Health of Uzbekistan have signed a roadmap, and a draft plan has been prepared with the Ministry of Health of Tajikistan. Joint research centres will be established in these countries by 2025, with co-financing from Russia. These centres will be cutting-edge facilities to support research in biological safety, in training national personnel, and developing diagnostic and treatment tools. The main guidelines for developing a unified infrastructure in a common epidemiological space are to strengthen the legal framework for biological safety; to promote collaboration on exploring evaluations of epidemiological situations; to develop a research lab infrastructure; to cooperate in addressing biosafety at United Nations platforms, including the World Health Organisation; and to strengthen control, at the national level, over biological activity carried out by foreign states and their representatives. This approach is consistent with the Statement of the CIS Heads of State on cooperation in the field of biological ыфауен, as adopted on October 15 in Minsk, and with the new CIS Cooperation Agreement on Sanitary Protection of the Territories, signed in May 2021. In 2022, the member states are preparing to sign an agreement on cooperation in response to and relief from sanitary and epidemiological emergencies. The biological and epidemiological security of the CIS countries is indivisible, which means that its response architecture should not be divisible either. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much, Ms Popova. Colleagues, are there any questions for Ms Popova about cooperation, or about the current situation? Yes, Mr Berdymuhamedov, go ahead please. President of Turkmenistan Gurbanguly Berdymuhamedov: May I have a minute. Mr Putin, First, we are very grateful to the Russian Federation. This pandemic has not been recorded in Turkmenistan as of today, and I must say that we owe this to the Russian Federation. We were one of the first to register Sputnik V and EpiVacCorona. Now our people have received both Sputnik V and EpiVacCorona jabs. Just the other day we received Sputnik Light and people are getting booster jabs. So, we are grateful. As for threats to biosafety in the CIS space, it would be good if we studied the issue again and signed a uniform document. Incidentally, we, Turkmenistan, have signed this document with the Russian Federation. I would also like to say the following. We have different zones: Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. These are arid zones and the clinical picture is different, say, from Russia where the climate is more humid. Therefore, it was proposed that we study the genome of the virus in our zones, and this would be correct, of course. As Ms Popova said, we need methodological assistance in this context. It would be good if Russia could give us, in a centralised way, its methodological instructions and manuals on both bacteriology and virology. We could have the same approaches on these issues. This is what I wanted to add to Ms Popova's remarks and, of course, to thank Russia once again for what it is doing for all of us today. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much, Mr Berdymuhamedov. We will, of course be moving forward in this direction. Thank you for this generalisation and the proposal on further cooperation. Colleagues, take the floor please. President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: Mr Putin, First, I would like to thank you for the idea of this report on the status of biological safety. I would like to recall that in the CSTO we have already signed agreements on cooperation on biosafety. I would also like to thank you for your aid to Kazakhstan in the most difficult time. Indeed, we managed to develop joint production of vaccines based on Russian Sputnik V technology in Karaganda as part of our common agreement. The Sputnik V vaccine has played a decisive role in stopping the spread of COVID-19. In this regard, I have a question for the speaker. Everyone is talking about ""Omicron"" now. What attitude should we have toward this new strain? What are the prospects for a concerted response? And, last, what can you tell us about the harmful consequences of this new strain? Anna Popova: Thank you very much. President Tokayev, Indeed, this was an anticipated change in the virus and yet it caught us off guard. The virus has not changed in the course of 2020. We have seen very little mutation. Unfortunately, the virus showed its ability to mutate in late 2020 with the first new Delta variant detected in South Africa and the UK. Viruses change, this is what they do, or they will stop developing. When we saw the unfolded sequence of the most recent variant that had been first detected in the Republic of South Africa, we became concerned, because it had a fairly large number of mutations. I want to thank our President, Mr Putin, who instructed us to go on a mission to South Africa. Specialists from the Ministry of Health and us were there within 24 hours. We were the first and, probably, the only foreign specialists, doctors, virologists and epidemiologists, who went on site. We saw what was happening there. The virus spreads very quickly, since it is highly contagious, much more contagious than the variants and mutations that we have seen before. In the Republic of South Africa we found that this strain does not cause severe illness. It affects large numbers of people at once, but severe cases develop only in non-vaccinated people – this is absolutely true – and in people with concurrent conditions like severe cases of diabetes or cancer. Our colleagues from the Republic of South Africa opened their doors to us, and I am very grateful to them, because our colleagues from Russia had the opportunity to tour the hospitals that were then open to visitors in Johannesburg and the laboratories. Since there are large numbers of Omicron cases around the world, this variant began to prevail over the Delta variant. Clearly, it will be a dominant strain and gradually replace other strains. This is not yet happening in the Russian Federation. We secured our borders from day one. I am aware that our colleagues from the CIS countries did exactly the same. In conjunction with our colleagues, we are following the developments in the CIS, which is critically important for us. In order to improve observation and monitoring, we have teamed up with several countries and made our capabilities available to them. We are conducting research on genetic variability as a team. That is, we are helping improve sequencing in other countries and are ready to engage our sequencing facilities, since, as directed by President Putin, we set up a major sequencing platform in January. We are willing to share our capabilities and to do this work for our colleagues from other countries. We are doing this for our colleagues in Belarus and Armenia, and we are willing to make our capabilities available to anyone to avoid missing the emergence and development of these viruses. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko: Ms Popova, this is all good but some things matter more than others for the heads of state. We will provide people with medical treatment in any case. You gave a very good example: when this new strain emerged in the Republic of South Africa, you were there to see what was happening. After all, the main question for us is predicting. I have demanded that my specialists give us a forecast of the developments from the first months of the pandemic. I wanted to have a forecast for a particular strain, hoping that one of them would take a risk and give a forecast. But frankly, not a single forecast on the strains circulating in Belarus has been correct. Several groups worked on it and they gave different forecasts but not a single one proved right in terms of timeframes. I spoke personally to your lower ranked experts and to scientists and they said it was very difficult to predict this into the future. They said they could not forecast a precise period of a strain's development. Maybe you can tell us what will happen tomorrow. It was Delta yesterday or today and it will be Omicron tomorrow. And what will happen the day after tomorrow? What can we expect? Anna Popova: Thank you very much, President Lukashenko. This question is, of course, extremely complicated. I think that nobody in the world can say unequivocally what will happen tomorrow. But I am absolutely certain that if we do not get vaccinated and take sanitary precautions today, the situation tomorrow will be worse. Considering that Omicron is spreading very quickly, the measures we have taken, and we have two areas… first, people should have as few contacts as possible so as not to pass on this infection to others. Second, people must be vaccinated, or maybe this is the first requirement. They need to be immune to the virus. No matter what strain develops, it will be a strain of the same virus. So vaccine protection will work better in some cases and worse in others, but it will work. So, the policy of the Russian Federation is to ensure maximum herd immunity. This is what we think today. As for epidemiological practice, our approach is as follows: we cannot expect anything for sure, but we prepare to take measures that will prevent a large number of cases. This is the main thing for us now. As for the virus, it will mutate and produce new strains. Scientists are telling us that it is already being or becoming seasonal today. It will come in a season of its choice. This is also uncertain at this point. It came in the autumn this time and will probably return in the spring. We will see what happens next. Vladimir Putin: I talked to the head of the Gamaleya Institute. They conducted a study and concluded that Sputnik V does neutralise the new Omicron strain. He told me only a clinical picture can give us a final answer – to what extent. However, the neutralisation level is very high. I talked to him literally a couple of days ago. They conducted these studies but now they must move to the second stage – clinical studies to establish the extent to which the vaccine neutralises the virus. He said they were a hundred percent certain that the vaccine they developed at the institute is very effective at neutralising the new strain. Alexander Lukashenko: Ms Popova, as I understand from your diplomatic statement, we should be anticipating more coronavirus variants, and Omicron is not the end of it, correct? Anna Popova: Not a single virus stops evolving, so we cannot expect Omicron to be the final variant. Omicron is more contagious, but causes less severe symptoms. No one can say what the next strain will be. However, viruses continue to live only if they evolve. President Putin, I will deliver the report if I may. Experts from Vektor also conducted studies on the effectiveness of Sputnik's post-vaccination immunity, and they are absolutely positive that it remains as effective for Omicron as it was for previous variants. The level of protection remains very high. Alexander Lukashenko: Ms Popova, my last question. I am sorry for asking these questions, but this is important to me. In plain terms, is Omicron lighter than Delta? Anna Popova: From what we see, it causes less severe illness. But so far we have seen it only in the Republic of South Africa with the average age of its population under 30 years, whereas in Russia it is much older. This could be a factor behind the lighter symptoms. We see the same thing in the UK, but their vaccination level is over 80 percent, which cannot be discounted, either. No other serious epidemiological surveys have yet been released, and we are following this very closely. But the fact that it is much more contagious and impacts more people at a time is also important. With the virus being so active, it is likely to affect people for whom getting ill with any variant represents high risk. This includes seniors, patients with severe conditions, including cancer, endocrine ailments, and diabetes. When a virus like this is widely spread among the population, getting sick with it is more likely. This is the scary part when it comes to Omicron. Alexander Lukashenko: This overstretches public health capabilities as well, I guess. Anna Popova: Yes, it can. Alexander Lukashenko: Here is what I was getting at. I wanted to hear you say that you, the researchers, feel that Omicron is a lighter version of Delta, and maybe we are already seeing the pandemic taper off? Anna Popova: Thank you, Mr President, we also really want to be hopeful, but are not getting our hopes up. So far, we have been focusing on the need to counteract the spread of the disease and to protect the public with jabs against the new variant. Alexander Lukashenko: Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Sputnik V is around 90 percent effective in terms of protection. Our colleagues from other countries are striving to achieve 90 to 95 percent immunisation. What is the current level in Russia? Anna Popova: We are getting close to 56 percent. Vladimir Putin: 56? Anna Popova: Correct, 56. Vladimir Putin: That includes people who have been ill with COVID-19 and vaccinated people? Anna Popova: This is all taken together, herd immunity. This is how it is calculated. Vladimir Putin: Herd immunity is 56 percent. Anna Popova: We are approaching 56. Vladimir Putin: But we need 90 percent. Anna Popova: Yes, 90 to 95 percent, as with measles or poliomyelitis, and then we will no longer have to deal with these infections. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Ms Popova, thank you very much. Anna Popova: Thank you very much, all the best. <…>"

Thank you for coming. I have to say, and you know it well, that when we gather with our colleagues to discuss any matter related to the development of the EAEU, the Eurasian Economic Union, we always remember that the idea belonged to you. We are thankful to you for initiating the creation of the union and for being its driving force for many years, at least until it got firmly established. Today, amid the difficult conditions of the pandemic, which has impacted global production, the mechanisms and tools that we developed with you at that time have been working efficiently. Suffice it to say that our relations with Kazakhstan in 2020, the hardest year of the pandemic, did not see a significant economic decline; out mutual trade decreased by just 4 percent. But in the first nine months of 2021, it grew by over 30 percent growth. This is, of course, a very important result of our joint activity with the current leadership of Kazakhstan, its President and Government. I would like to thank you again for the idea and its implementation. Welcome, Mr Nazarbayev, we are happy to see you. Nursultan Nazarbayev Nazarbayev Nursultan: Thank you, Mr President, for the invitation to come as the honorary chairman of the Eurasian Economic Union. Our President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev will come here to discuss various issues on behalf of Kazakhstan. As the honorary chairman, the most experienced representative who was at the front line of history, I will also take part. This is an informal CIS summit, isn't it? I am the only one left of those who created the CIS in Almaty in December 1991, and I remember how it happened. Now, as per your proposal, I was elected honorary chairman. The Eurasian Economic Union has established itself, and will mark its 7th anniversary. Despite the pandemic, we all see that what you said is correct. Especially what you said about the relations between Kazakhstan and Russia: our mutual trade will reach $24 billion, which is a historical record, and we achieved it despite the pandemic. Our goal is to continue to develop the Eurasian Economic Union and accept new associated members and observers. They will see how beneficial it is to be part of this association that is based on a consensus, does not impinge on anyone and takes the interests of all its members into account. I would like to use this opportunity to wish you a happy New Year. The departing year marked the 30th anniversary of independence of Kazakhstan and of many other countries as well. For you, it was the year of the State Duma election. I can imagine how busy you are, given the difficult conditions and the confrontation between the collective West and Russia. Russia and Kazakhstan have a model relationship. Vladimir Putin: Absolutely. Nursultan Nazarbayev: We have built special relations. I hope that they will remain the same under the new President because we are neighbours who have special affinity and it is in our mutual interests to remain as we are. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Thank you for the warm wishes. I also wish you and the entire nation of Kazakhstan happy holidays. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67457,Conversation with President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon,2021-12-27T15:35:00Z,St Petersburg,Vladimir Putin met with President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon at Constantine Palace.,"Emomali Rahmon arrived in Russia for the informal CIS summit on December 28 in St Petersburg. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Rahmon, Thank you for accepting our invitation and for coming. Unfortunately, we could not meet earlier due to epidemiological reasons, but I am very happy to see you here in Russia, in St Petersburg. Tomorrow, we will have the opportunity to talk to our colleagues and friends from the EAEU and the CSTO before the New Year and discuss what has been done and look into future plans. I would like to add that last year, we had a certain decline, as with almost all of our partners, in trade and economic relations: trade volumes fell by more than 15 percent. But this year, we are seeing a 45-percent growth, so we are back to everything we lost last year, and even increased it. Tajikistan is one of our most reliable, loyal and close allies. We have been developing our relations in all areas, including security. The situation on the border with Afghanistan – we are in constant contact on that matter – causes alarm and concern. These are objective circumstances, and I share your concern about it. As you know, we are actively working on improving Tajikistan's defensive capacities. Based on our agreements, we recently shipped new weapons and other equipment to strengthen the country's armed forces so that Tajikistan can efficiently resist any threats that come from the outside. The military base we created at one time is still being developed and is one of the major security elements in the region. I know that you are also in contact with our military, are in control of the situation and help them so that they have good living conditions. We will continue working in this area. And, finally, the important humanitarian aspect. I know that you pay attention to and care for the development of the Russian language, something that is being developed successfully with your support. Many people want to study Russian, and this is understandable because about a million people from Tajikistan live and work in Russia on a temporary basis. In 2019, they sent an estimated $1.8 billion back to Tajikistan. Last year, the number of workers decreased in connection with the pandemic, but about $1.7 billion was sent back. As agreed, you and I address matters related to these migration flows, partly to support the economy of Tajikistan, and the people as well. Russian industry and its entire economy, as well as the construction sector, are interested in attracting skilled and hard-working people. We noted that Russian language courses are the best way to help people adapt so that they can work calmly and feel comfortable. Today we are focusing on these and other matters which form the agenda of our current meeting. I am very happy to see you. President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon: Thank you very much, Mr Putin. First of all, I would like to congratulate you and the fraternal people of Russia on the upcoming New Year. I wish you robust health, new major successes, and I wish peace, wellbeing and prosperity to the people of Russia. Relations between our countries are developing dynamically in all areas. As you just noted, Russia remains Tajikistan's main trade and economic partner. This year's trade volumes topped $1 billion and increased 25 percent over 2020. Cultural and humanitarian ties are developing actively, and we cooperate closely on security matters. I am ready to discuss the state of our relations and their prospects with you, as well as international and regional matters, while focusing on the Afghan problem. Once again, thank you very much for your invitation. <…>"

The boy visited the museum room and received a firefighter uniform as a gift. Later he, along with his parents and older brother, watched a concert marking Rescue Worker's Day. The President heard about Osor's dream to become a firefighter for a day on December 5 during the#WeAreTogether awards ceremony. It is Vladimir Putin's fourth time taking part in the New Year Tree of Wishes national campaign. The President picked three ornaments with children's wishes. One of them was Osor's. Vladimir Putin also spoke to another participant in the charity campaign, Mark Koblenev from the Moscow Region. Mark's dream of getting a guitar for the New Year holiday came true on December 21. It was also then, a week ago, that Vladimir Putin learned from Mark's mum about their hardship. She admitted that they had no home of their own and had to stay with friends. The President promised to help. A few days ago, Nadezhda and Mark moved into their own flat. The large family with which Mark used to live also received help to improve their living conditions. The President spoke with them over the phone as well."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67452,Congratulations on Rescue Worker's Day,2021-12-27T09:00:00Z,NA,Vladimir Putin made a video address congratulating current and former staff of the Emergencies Ministry on Rescue Worker's Day.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrade officers, dear veterans, I congratulate you on your professional holiday, Rescue Worker's Day. First of all, I want to thank you for doing your demanding and difficult work that is fraught with danger, for solving a large array of tasks assigned to the Russian Emergencies Ministry in a laudable, honest and scrupulous manner. All of these tasks are highly responsible, important and meaningful for our citizens, society and the state, and are directly connected with protecting people's health and lives. In the outgoing year, the Emergency Ministry's units faced off flooding aftermath, saved towns and villages from fire in many Russian regions, and solved crucial issues in fighting the coronavirus epidemic. I will specially highlight the fact that the Ministry's specialists were actively and professionally engaged in Russia's humanitarian missions in Afghanistan, Syria and other countries, and delivered coronavirus vaccines to Cuba, Mozambique, India and the Republic of South Africa. I want to stress again that our rescue workers are among the best in terms of professionalism, experience, speed and precision of performing most complicated and extraordinary missions. You set standards for your colleagues around the globe to follow. Russia is rightly proud of you. Our citizens can be confident that Emergencies Ministry personnel are always ready to come to the rescue at any time of day or night and will engage all reserves and all available means, equipment and staff to quickly liquidate any threat and will be fighting for each person even at the cost of their lives. Our comrades who sacrificed their lives for others will remain with us forever in the roll of honour of the Emergencies Ministry's best personnel. Among them are courageous and fearless rescue workers who died at the Listvyazhnaya mine and the Emergencies Minister, Army General Yevgeny Zinichev. I am confident that the Russian rescue workers will always honour, carefully preserve and follow the traditions of selfless dedicated service to their country and people. This is a reliable basis for enhancing the Ministry's personnel, for comprehensive professional training and further growth of young officers who feel deep and sincere respect towards veterans of the rescue service who stood at the origins of the present-day system of the Russian Emergencies Ministry. Their personal contribution to its establishment and development deserves high praise and appreciation. Once again I congratulate all of you on your professional holiday and the coming New Year. I wish you success in your noble and much needed service, happiness and good health to you and your families."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67448,Joint meeting of the State Council and the Council for Science and Education,2021-12-24T17:00:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region","Vladimir Putin held, via videoconference, a joint meeting of the State Council and the Presidential Council for Science and Education. The participants discussed the results of the Year of Science and Technology in Russia and the further development of the country's scientific potential.","President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues, friends. Today we are holding a joint meeting of the State Council and the Council for Science and Education. It is being attended by the heads of regions and political parties, representatives of our science and research community, members of the Government and the Security Council. This expanded meeting is held on the occasion of the end of the Year of Science and Technology. We will sum up the results and discuss our joint plans for the further development of science in general and of scientific education, taking into account the huge attention given to the achievements of our scientists by our society and citizens. Of course, we also need to consider the growing public demand for modernisation of our cities and all other residential areas based on the latest technological and environmental standards and the comprehensive use of cutting-edge scientific research achievements in everyday life. In this context, one more important issue on our agenda– further steps to build up the innovation potential of Russian regions as a key condition of wellbeing and a high quality of life for people across our vast country. This is not just about creating new knowledge and technology. Again, it is extremely important to use these directly in practical terms in healthcare and education, on transport and utility infrastructure, in resolving environmental, social and other socially important tasks. I will say again that Russia and our regions can only develop together with science. This is why for two decades we have consistently tried to expand the scientific geography of the country, focusing on the formation of advanced research infrastructure and the strengthening of universities in the regions. As a result, the number of universities engaged in research has increased almost three-fold. Research and backbone universities in the regions of the Federation have become real flagships for whole territories. Joint objectives are already uniting research universities, institutes and companies from different regions of Russia. We will certainly encourage such cooperation in the future as well, because our enormous country badly needs distributed scientific development, as we have said many times. Not some individual centres located in just a few areas but a truly integral space covering the entire country– as Academician Vernadsky used to say, an area of scientific pursuit, creative solutions, education, support and encouragement of the talents of advanced technical business. This is the approach that lies at the foundation of research and educational centres in the world and is vital for implementing federal programmes on genetics and agriculture. I know that important and innovative projects of national significance will receive a broad regional dimension. They will be aimed at resolving medical and pharmaceutical goals, as well as problems related to climate change and development of new energy sources. What do I consider extremely important? We can set ambitious research goals because we have created strong personnel potential and will certainly develop and strengthen it. In this context, I would like to tell you about the new plans that were prepared after our meeting with young scientists at Sirius in early December. First, the mega grants programme will continue. We will rearrange the requirements to enable prominent scientists to create strong international research teams here in Russia which will attract not only young researchers from within the country, but also our compatriots and foreign specialists. In fact, this is already the case, and I hope that this will carry on in the future. Of course, the mission of these world-class laboratories is to expand and reinforce opportunities across the country. They will be created in universities and research centres in the Volga Region, in Siberia, in Russia's Far East, its central and southern parts, and of course in the northern regions of our country. By the way, biologists, experts in environment protection and other fields, including climate change, are currently working in Russia's Arctic territories, in the challenging environment of the Extreme North. Of course, we must support these researchers, including paying them the so-called northern bonuses in full, not later, in many years, but here and now, the very first month they start working there. This was also among the requests I heard during a meeting with our colleagues at the Sirius centre. Let me note that for most locations in Russia's Extreme North, these bonuses amount to about 80 percent of wages. This is a substantial increase for a researcher, considering that, as you know, scientists must be paid at the level of 200 percent of the average wage in the region. I would like to make a special point on youth support. Thanks to the Russian Science Foundation, we already have a comprehensive programme for allocating grants to young researchers for undertaking various projects, from small studies to running research teams. I am certain that post-graduate students must also benefit from clear and unified incentives of this kind. Of course, I am referring to young researchers who are serious about science and achieve something, who already work for the benefit of their regions and are ready to implement their innovations there. As for housing, during the meeting at Sirius, our colleagues also asked me to expand the housing certificate programme and make sure young researchers and university faculty members who achieve substantial results and succeed in their work are the first to get these certificates, regardless of how long they have been working and what ministry or agency the organisation that employs them reports to. The same principles must apply to apartments these people rent from their institutions. It is hard to argue with that, and I agree with this proposal– the Government must take all the necessary decisions in this regard quickly. Colleagues, Our science is among the world's youngest in terms of the researchers' age, and its capacity is being strengthened at the institutions of higher learning and universities. Importantly, an increasing number of parents are supporting their children in their choice to pursue a scientific career. In our country, researchers under 40 account for 44.3 percent of academia. Almost two-thirds of the parents, two-thirds of adults in our country want to see their children choose a scientific career. These meaningful, positive and, I am sure, long-term trends must be supported. At least 25 university campuses will be built in the 2020s. Importantly, they must be outfitted with advanced equipment for academic and research activities and with proper amenities for playing sports, launching start-ups and operating technology companies. These things need to be planned in advance before starting this large-scale work. This programme must be an example of joint work of the government, business, and constituent entities of the Federation aimed at creating a modern environment for young, talented people. This is the most important condition for advancing scientific research and technology in our regions. Today, we will definitely discuss mechanisms and the best models for creating social and residential infrastructure and public spaces next to universities and research centres in the regions of the Federation with the involvement of development institutions. In this regard, I would like to emphasise that the tools and the federal programmes that were mentioned today will pay off if and only if– and here I want to address heads of the constituent entities of the Federation– if you, colleagues, meaningfully engage in technological, scientific and educational development, and only if you see this area as a powerful resource and understand the importance of these matters for the people and for the fulfilment of young people in your respective regions and cities. So, please make sure to communicate closely with young researchers, students and even school research teams, provide them with weighty support, and create better opportunities for launching innovative projects that will become a magnet for talent from other regions and even other countries. Of course, it is the Russian regions working with large companies, including state-owned companies, that should act as qualified consumers of knowledge and technology, especially since our fundamental groundwork allows businesses to create unique competitive solutions. In order to do this, we need to lift a number of remaining barriers that hinder cooperation between science and the regions, and to create conditions for businesses to invest more actively in technological development. So I would like to ask the members of the State Council and the Council for Science and Education as well as the Government to address these issues. You know what I mean. Nevertheless, let me repeat some things. First, we have to help scientific and innovative teams get through the most difficult stage and do it efficiently, quickly, and effectively; this is the technology approbation stage in real life. Next we need to start implementing them in the city, at enterprises and institutions. I mean up-to-date regulatory control, including application of experimental legal regimes in the Russian regions. Of course, it is necessary to use the resources of our world-class scientific and education centres, which would include direct interaction between science and companies operating in the regions. Second, we need to expand the Russian regions' alternatives for supporting scientific and technology projects, assist regional scientific foundations that provide grants for research and development. Let me also note that the State Duma has adopted, in the first reading, a draft law that allows regional budgets to fund the work at federal institutions, such as universities and research organisations. I would like to draw the attention of my colleagues from the Government and from the parliament: regions with low fiscal capacity should also have this support. I understand the questions that arise in this context, but I still believe that this should be done even for the regions that receive subsidies, if they can justify their expenses accordingly. In general, I am asking you to resolve any existing disagreements as soon as possible and adopt the necessary amendments to the law. Third, we need to create a base of Russian technology solutions that are already in use in the Russian regions and that have already proven their effectiveness; for example, a common digital platform of best practices would serve to ensure interaction between teams of entrepreneurs, scientists, and management teams all across Russia. Finally, I consider it necessary to encourage those regions in the Federation that are working to increase their scientific and technological potential. The logic here is very understandable and simple. Additional support must be given to those territories that make breakthrough developments and launch major research, innovative and education projects. This means that researchers, entrepreneurs and engineers go there to implement the needed projects for developing these territories. I know that at a special seminar with experts from the Council for Science and Education the governors discussed in detail successful approaches and projects in this area and new steps on developing science and technology in the regions. Today, I would like to hear your proposals that, I hope, are a response to those debates. One more point: starting next year, the events of the Congress of Young Scientists will take place all over the country, in different regions. Young scientists at Sirius asked me about this, in part, to enable our research teams to meet with their potential customers, that is, you, your colleagues from regional teams and business representatives. I know that you(I am talking to the regional governors again) will personally take part in these meetings. This is very important, and this is my request to you. Friends, Before we move to speeches and discussions, I would like to turn again to the results of the Year of Science and Technology. I will repeat that the main, key result is a fundamentally new level of scientific education. Using advanced technology, tens of millions of people saw lectures by scientists and hours-long marathons of the revived Knowledge society. It is no exaggeration to say that public interest in science, its history and achievements is tremendous. I think it would be appropriate to make the Year of Science and Technology the beginning of a decade that will further encourage the development of education in Russia. I am confident that all political and public entities will support this decision. Of course, I hope for engaged participation from our regions in this work. First, I would like to ask you to help create centres for research volunteers, including at universities, and provide assistance in drafting education tour routes. I mean taking students and schoolchildren on expeditions and excursions to mega-science class installations, research centres, the Vostochny Cosmodrome and the like. All these are opportunities for young people to become familiar with the work of our scientists and Russian science and to continue its great history into the future. I have no doubt that this is how it will be. Using this opportunity, I would like to once again thank our school students who won all international academic competitions in natural sciences this year– physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics and informatics. Let's wish new success to them together. <…> Vladimir Putin: First, I would like to thank everyone for your hard work this year. Second, I would like to ask the Government and the Presidential Executive Office to finalise the list of Presidential instructions based on the results of our joint work this year and, of course, with consideration for the proposals made at today's meeting. I looked carefully at some things while preparing for this meeting and now, during our discussion, I see some issues that require additional work(I will not torture anyone about it now) on taxation and additional funding. I understand the subtleties of these proposals, and we need to analyse them properly with the Finance Ministry. I would like to ask Mr Siluanov[Finance Minister] to approach this task with due consideration for the importance of the subject we discussed today. I would like to congratulate you on the upcoming holidays. We will certainly continue this work in the future. I talked about a decade, and this is what we should do. This is the road we will follow. But it is important to make sure this idea does not become trite, that it does not simply turn into a declaration that we will be involved with science for the next ten years. Science requires ongoing attention, whether we are talking about the past 100 years or 300 years or in the next decade, but we need to organise this effort in a way that will make it exciting. As my colleagues said it should be made interesting and attract young people. In principle, we are succeeding with this goal, and I have told you about the number of young researchers in our country. This number will grow, and the future of Russian science will certainly be guaranteed if we consistently implement the tasks that we have set. In conclusion, I would like to address Mr Manturov. I think he knows that a salvo launch of the Tsircon hypersonic system was made this night, or more precisely, in the early morning hours. The Tsircon supersonic system is our latest missile that can hit sea- and ground-based targets. Yes, the test was successful, it was impeccable, and it is a great event in the life of our country and a big step towards increasing Russia's security and enhancing its defence capability. I would like to ask you to convey my best wishes and congratulations to the teams that worked on this advance, to thank them for the result. I want to express my most sincere words of gratitude to the developers, designers, engineers and workers, all those who were involved in this. Thank you very much. All the best. Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov Manturov DenisDeputy Prime Minister– Industry and Trade Minister: Thank you very much, Mr President. This event took place at 5.30 am. I will convey your words to all of them. Thank you very much. Vladimir Putin: Thank you everyone and all the best."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67447,Meeting with Government members,2021-12-24T14:55:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region","The President held, via videoconference, a traditional meeting with Government members ahead of the New Year holidays to discuss the Cabinet's performance and the main goals for 2022.","President of Russia Vladimir Putin: We are holding this meeting with only one week left until the New Year. It is right around the corner. We meet in this format every year. You know that the last days of the year usually fly by very quickly. People are busy trying to do more than they usually do, meet deadlines and deliver on their plans. I have no doubt that this is the way the Government is working right now, although probably this is the way the Government always works, not just today, with the New Year holidays fast approaching. After all, we live in challenging times, requiring all of us to be as effective and proactive as possible. With all my heart, I would like to wish you a Happy New Year and thank you for your work. I do understand and I can see that all of you have had to shoulder an additional burden. You have been managing this workload quite efficiently, acting in a concise manner and staying united as a team, as true professionals. Not only did the national economy recover from last year's downturn but it has already exceeded pre-crisis levels and is once again expanding. The situation on the labour market is now even better than it was before the crisis. Unemployment is declining. Our effort to fight this dangerous epidemic is in its second year. We continued to undertake targeted measures to support people, families with children and preserve jobs, as well as assist the key sectors of the economy and enterprises, SMEs and socially-oriented non-profit organisations. This has required a major system-wide effort from us. However, we know all too well that we have yet to rein in the epidemic. Unfortunately, too many people are still falling sick and dying every day. For this reason, I am asking you to continue paying special attention to matters related to supporting the healthcare system and to all epidemic control measures, including during the holiday season in early 2022. In this connection, I would like to say a few words about the system-wide efforts that we will undertake next year. Let me note that overall, national projects have been advancing on schedule despite all the challenges and the adjustments we were forced to make. You and I regularly discuss this. We are almost halfway through with these national projects. They have been in place for three years now, and all the plans we have announced must be fulfilled within the next three-year period. We discussed this recently at the Council for Strategic Development and National Projects. Once again, I would like to emphasise that we must place people and their wellbeing at the centre of all our large-scale efforts to deliver on the national development goals. People must see and feel, as we have been saying all along, tangible change for the better in metropolitan cities, as well as in small towns and rural areas. This is what national projects are all about. Next year, we will all aspire to achieve these tangible and visible results. Russia is mostly past the economic recovery stage. Our economy has shown high resiliency in the context of the pandemic and complex global challenges. Now we move to the next level where we need to ensure high-quality and long-term economic growth right away, without a pause. To achieve this, we have substantial state resources and the high investment potential of private business. We must use all growth factors to full capacity. I am referring to the aggressive development of infrastructure, digitalisation and technological upgrade of industries, promoting energy efficiency and advanced environmental standards, increasing non-resource exports, training forward-looking employees, and supporting people's business initiative. Naturally, our goal is not economic growth per se; that is not an end in itself. It is needed to create new jobs, to create a modern living environment across the country, in our cities and towns, and drive an increase in the people's incomes, Russian families' incomes. Again, increasing people's real incomes is the key issue here. We must employ all economic policy measures, including further suppressing inflation. We have some competing figures here– inflation has increased, but real disposable incomes have also increased. So we need to do everything in our power to keep inflation down, suppress it, while real disposable incomes grow. We need to protect people from price spikes that hit people with low incomes the hardest. You know that decisions have been made to increase the indexation of the minimum wage and the subsistence level. We did that, and social benefits and payments will also increase accordingly. However, this is certainly not enough. This is only the necessary minimum of what the state is obliged to do. We need to work more on creating the right conditions for people to have a solid source of income. This includes reducing the costs of doing business, helping businesses free up capital to raise wages, to maintain existing jobs and create new ones. In the coming year, I ask you to place special emphasis on employment programmes for young people, as well as work more with the regions where unemployment is high due to regional specifics– you know what I am talking about, primarily single-industry towns. To address this, we need targeted and weighted solutions for each specific region that is struggling with this problem. In general, it is important to move from emergency anti-crisis support measures to system-wide steps to stimulate employment and business activity, to attract investment and technology to the Russian economy, to promising projects that should contribute to a decent and comfortable living in all regions of our country. Colleagues, I will not list all the tasks right now, all the challenges facing you, us, the Government, the Presidential Office and the President personally in the new year. There is a lot of work to do, and I am sure that each of you feels a personal responsibility for your entrusted area. At the same time, a team effort is most important in achieving a common result in the interests of the people, of our entire vast country. Friends, Once again, I thank you all for our joint work. I wish a very happy New Year to you, your colleagues, employees of the Government Staff, ministries, government agencies and all executive authority bodies. I wish you good health, success and all the best in the New Year 2022. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin Mishustin MikhailPrime Minister of the Russian Federation: Mr President, we would like to thank you for your kind words and your New Year greetings. Of course, from all our hearts we wish you and your close ones a Happy New Year. We would also like to thank you for being there for us throughout this year in all our undertakings. Let me also assure you that we will do everything to achieve the national development goals you have set. We will do everything for the people of Russia to live a good life. Once again, thank you for your kind words. Vladimir Putin: Mr Mishustin, please take note of the issues the correspondents from the regions raised yesterday during the annual news conference. I am referring to regional matters and problems. A journalist from Daghestan inquired about what to expect in their region in several spheres: energy, water supply, connections to gas pipelines, etc. I also know that efforts are underway to overcome the consequences of an accident at the heat and power station[in Ulan-Ude]. There was also a question on Russian Railways, although the Government is less involved in this sector. Still, the Transport Ministry must help Russian Railways. They are ready to start selling tickets for the destinations mentioned by the Yoshkar-Ola correspondent, which includes trains to St Petersburg and the south of Russia. If Russian Railways needs help, please support them. Mikhail Mishustin: Understood, Mr President. Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much. All the best to all of you. Keep in touch."

I think that we can get down to work. There is quite a distance between us, but I do hope that our technical staff have made all the necessary arrangements so that you can hear me well. I also hope that I will be able to hear you clearly. Mr Peskov, I think that we can begin without any lengthy introductory remarks, since this would be more useful and interesting for everyone. During this meeting, I will try to answer your questions, and, without any opening remarks, satisfy your curiosity and inform you on the outcomes of this year, as well as what we expect in the near future, and what we will strive to achieve in our work. Mr Peskov, please. Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office– Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov: Let us begin. To start with, I would like to give the floor to the true doyen of the Russian journalistic corps– one of the Interfax agency leaders, Vyacheslav Terekhov. Please pass the microphone to the first row. Vyacheslav Terekhov: Good afternoon, Mr President. The sound will be somewhat muffled, a mixed sound, as radio operators say. You just said you will talk about further economic development– the world has been waging a global war on the coronavirus for the past two years, and now we will be fighting the Omicron variant, of course. How has this war affected the Russian economy? It has indeed affected almost everyone in some way. What are the ways out of this economic crisis, out of this pit, what drivers are there? Do we have to wait until everyone gets vaccinated before we can discuss the possibility of economic growth? And the most important question, of course: how do you assess the work of your'general staff'– the Government and the Central Bank– during this'war'? Sorry, when I mentioned the Central Bank just now, I remembered that my questions have always referred to the Central Bank, during the past three or four news conferences, except the most recent one– it just happens. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: If I provide full answers to all your questions, even if I succeed in this task, I believe we could round up this news conference after that. These are very broad questions. In fact, they touch upon our main efforts, as well as those of the entire world, which, as you have mentioned, has been fighting the coronavirus. This struggle continues, and we are aware of the dangers that Omicron, this new strain, poses. I think that we will have an opportunity to get back to this topic during today's meeting. As you may know, a group of Russian scientists and experts is now in South Africa, where their colleagues actually discovered this new strain. They are working there, and are quite successful at that. Once again, I would like to thank our colleagues from South Africa. As for the impact this situation has had on the Russian economy, and what we are to expect in the near future, we have spoken about this, in general terms, many times. Faced with the challenges posed by Covid-19 and the restrictions the economy and the social sector have had to face in this connection, it is obvious that the Russian economy has been better mobilised and prepared to withstand these shocks compared to many other developed economies around the world, if we look at the top five, six, seven or ten major economies, or even twenty. I will discuss this in more detail later during our news conference today. The Russian economy declined by three percent, which is much better than many of the world's leading economies, and we recovered faster than many others. You know the numbers. Even last year, we could see the trends, and today I even have a chart here with me, and will share this information with you in order to be precise. GDP growth is expected at the level of 4.5 percent this year. It has added 4.6 percent as of the end of October, while manufacturing increased by 5 percent, and the processing sector grew by 5.2 percent. Crop yields will be slightly lower in 2021 compared to the previous year, which is due to the weather. We had 133.5 million tonnes in 2020 and now have 123 million tonnes. Still, this is a very robust result which not only enables us to satisfy our needs, but also provides for a substantial export potential. Fixed capital investment was up 7.6 percent as of November. We expect this indicator for the entire year to come in at 6 percent, up from a 1.4 percent decline in 2020. The construction sector performed quite well, with a record high of 90 million square metres built. This is the first time we have achieved this figure in Russia's contemporary history. I would like to congratulate all those involved in the construction sector, from the top executives to on-site construction workers, with this milestone. Thank goodness, average wages have started to grow in real terms. There are also changes in terms of real disposable income. We had a 2 percent decline in 2020, but this year we expect this figure to rise. Of course, we will talk about inflation. We expect the inflation rate to be 8 percent. It is much higher than the forecast. But, even adjusted for inflation, real income has still increased by 4.1 percent. Our experts estimate that real income will show a 3.5-percent annual growth. Of course, this will not be true for all categories of citizens. Naturally, it is an average rate and I want to stress this once again, when people watch this and listen to this, they might say: it's an average again. But we have to talk in average numbers since they serve as a certain benchmark. I think we will cover the topic of personal income in more detail today. We set a goal of returning to the pre-pandemic unemployment rate– and it did go down. The unemployment rate before the pandemic was around 4.6‒4.7 percent. The current rate is 4.3 percent. It may go up a little to 4.4 percent by the end of the year. This is a very good indicator for the performance of the economy in general even though there are certain difficulties and challenges related to the labour market such as, for example, the number of people working at the construction sites we have just mentioned. It is a serious issue. Now, I would like to speak about the trade surplus. Last year, despite all the difficulties, Russia's trade surplus amounted to 94 billion[US$]. This year, the figure has almost doubled, reaching 184 billion, which is also an excellent result. Russia's foreign debt has slightly decreased. It is the lowest level of foreign debt in the world, around four percent. What other important indicators speak for the quality of governance and the performance of the entire state, the Government and the Central Bank, in particular? Our international reserves have grown from US$595 to US$625.5 billion. The National Welfare Fund is growing as well and currently amounts to US$185.2 billion. All these figures are an indication of stability and good macroeconomic results. There are issues that cannot but cause concern, including life expectancy, which has slightly decreased from 71.5 to 70.1 years. We will most likely cover this topic today as well. It is one of the negative consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. Right. So, on the whole, I believe that both the Government and the Central Bank deserve– let us be modest– an acceptable score. The results are positive. Now, about the growth drivers. Your question was about the potential growth drivers, and about vaccination– if we need to have the entire population vaccinated or not. Look, we have already spoken many times about the growth drivers for our country based on the specific situation that has developed over a fairly extensive period. We can even consider the entire post-war period, since 1945. What are our challenges and what are the drivers, accordingly? I have just spoken about an unfortunate decrease in life expectancy, an increase in mortality in our country, and in this regard, one of the most important problems, one of the most important challenges that we face is getting more acute– I am referring to demographics. It is a challenge both from a humanitarian point of view and from the geopolitical perspective as well, I mean the country's population– 146 million for such a vast territory is definitely not enough; economically too, we have a workforce shortage. As far as I know, the working age population is now just above 81 million. We must drastically increase this figure by 2024, by 2030. This is one of the factors of economic growth, let alone– I would like to emphasise this once again– the geopolitical and humanitarian components of this most important matter. Therefore, preserving the people that Solzhenitsyn wrote about is becoming one of our most important tasks and one of the drivers of growth. Second. What other growth drivers? The next driver is infrastructure, infrastructure development. In this regard, I can say that we are making very strong efforts on this track. You know that we are channeling 500 billion rubles of federal funds directly towards the development of infrastructure. Then there are the National Projects; we started with 260 billion, I believe, then more than 400 billion, and next year, we will allocate 460 or so. We plan to allocate another 2.5 trillion rubles from the National Wealth Fund in the next few years– 2.5 trillion overall. Of course, the third growth driver is increasing labour efficiency but this includes a whole set of programmes from education and digital transformation to healthcare, which we have already mentioned. This includes an entire set of programmes. Most of them are ready, so we know what to do. We have earmarked the resources needed to move in this direction, and we provide for regular allocations. The funds to this effect are available. All we need to do is set up this work properly and achieve maximum returns on every ruble we invest in delivering on these objectives. Finally, one of your questions was about vaccinating the entire country. Unfortunately, in Russia the vaccination rate is low, just like in many other countries– take, for example, some European countries where the low level of vaccination is also a matter of concern. This is the case for Germany with its developed healthcare, but even there the healthcare system, one of the most effective in Europe, faces a lot of criticism. What is the vaccination rate in Russia? As of today, or maybe yesterday, it was 59.4 precent. I had no doubt that this would be one of the main topics during today's news conference, so I talked to Ms Popova and Ms Golikova. The figure of 59.4 percent is where we are in terms of achieving herd immunity in Russia. This includes both those who have recovered from the coronavirus infection, as well as those who have received the jab. Some 70 million people have received the first dose, and a little over 70 have had both. This is not enough. We need about 80 percent of our population to be immune to achieve herd immunity. I hope that next year, at least by the end of the first quarter or in the second quarter, we will have reached this level. Some countries are already talking about the need for 90–95 percent to be immune in order to achieve herd immunity. This is how things stand, more or less. Thank you. Dmitry Peskov: Thank you. Moving on, I suggest that we go through Russia's major news agencies. TASS news agency, please, go ahead. Veronika Ichetkina: Good afternoon. Veronika Ichetkina, TASS News Agency. In a way, I would like to follow up on social spending by the state and the budget. The state has recently increased its social spending. Judging by the budget for the next three years, as adopted recently, the state will continue doing so. It is curious that there was a lot of talk some time ago about social spending cuts next year. Can you comment on these allegations? Overall, how would you describe the new budget? Can it be called a development budget or a budget with a social focus? If you will allow me, I would like to finish my question. May I? Are any further increases in social spending possible during the pandemic? If this does happen, have you assessed the risk of inflation spiralling out of control, considering that it is already quite jumpy. Thank you. ladimir Putin: First, about the characteristics of the budget. Of course, it is a socially-oriented budget. Naturally. I extensively discussed this matter with my colleagues from the Government yesterday. If you look at healthcare and social spending, the healthcare expenses, for example, are, obviously, growing. The federal budget expenditures, the compulsory healthcare insurance budget and the regional budgets amount to 1.5–1.7 trillion in total. Moreover, I think we planned to allocate around 3.6 trillion for healthcare from two sources, the federal budget and the compulsory healthcare insurance system. This year we are about to reach 3.9 or 4 trillion in spending. Next year the plan is 4 trillion, and, obviously, the actual amount will be higher. These are completely objective figures. And I did not include regional expenses, which vary from region to region and from year to year. They currently amount to 1.6–1.7 trillion, which is quite significant. If we speak about the social sphere, there has been an apparent increase in spending. Even during the pandemic, when we were developing support measures for the most severely affected sectors of the economy(and the numbers were huge, 4.5 percent of the GDP last year and another percent of the GDP this year, which makes 5.5 percent in total), we did not just give away money randomly. Our support for the hardest hit industries focused on preserving jobs and supporting people with low incomes who are particularly vulnerable in these circumstances. Who are these people? First of all, young families with children. I think I do not have to list all the measures, but I will mention some that are widely known. We added more categories of families to those receiving state support– for example, all families with children aged three and younger. We started paying maternity capital for the first child. Then, we began paying benefits to pregnant women who are experiencing hardship. We paid additional benefits for children aged three to seven. We paid one-time benefits of 5,000 and 10,000 rubles to different categories– primarily people facing financial difficulties. It is an entire toolkit of measures– worth 4.5 trillion rubles last year, and we continued this kind of support into 2021. Again, we did it all to either directly support people, or support them through businesses– we provided financial support to companies that kept people on board and maintained a certain level of wages. Among other things, as you know, we have recently increased the minimum wage and subsistence level. At first glance, this might not be a significant increase, but the idea is to have social benefits indexed immediately, and this affects millions of people. All social benefits are calculated on the basis of the minimum wage or subsistence level, and by the way, this also leads to indexation of certain pensions. Therefore, without a doubt, this budget can be described as socially focused. Answering your colleague's question about growth drivers, I have mentioned some of our absolutely unprecedented, grandiose infrastructure development plans. Look at the massive resources to be invested: we plan to allocate 2.5 trillion from the NWF alone; 500 billion has already been allocated; and 460[billion] will be additionally allocated next year. We will also invest hugely in labour productivity and digitalisation in all industries, practically from top to bottom. Therefore, as I am saying, this budget is socially focused, but it is also focused on development. This much is absolutely obvious if you look at the figures. Veronika Ichetkina: May I clarify something? Vladimir Putin: Yes, of course, go ahead. Veronika Ichetkina: I have also asked how higher social spending will affect inflation. Vladimir Putin: Yes, right. Sorry. You are absolutely right, and this is one of the key issues with maintaining macroeconomic stability, because many of the world's leading economies have relaxed their macroeconomic policies and have significantly accelerated their money printing presses. This is an obvious thing, and it has led to a fairly high inflation in the leading economies– this much is also obvious. Everyone sees this– these are the numbers everyone can see. Budget deficits are growing in all leading countries, all of them, higher in the United States, slightly less in the eurozone, but still, this is a significant and unusual change. For example, the inflation rate in the world's leading economy, the United States, is 6.1–6.2 percent, if memory serves, whereas the target figure was 2 percent. In other words, the inflation rate is three time above the target figure. Inflation is high in Russia as well, 8 percent, while the target was 4 percent. Our inflation rate has grown twofold, whereas it has tripled in the United States. This is serious. I believe that the FRS[US Federal Reserve System] will have to do something about this. This soft monetary policy is having an impact on macroeconomics and ultimately cancels out the positive goals of this policy, including support for the economy and the citizens. We have this problem as well, because 8 percent is too high, and we certainly need to attain the target rate of 4 percent. Of course, we can criticise the Central Bank. I am aware of this, because I maintain daily contact with our colleagues from the real economy sector, and I know that they are criticising the Central Bank, and I know their arguments. Trust me, we meet nearly every day, although this is not reported on television. They sit three metres from me, and we discuss problems. Television only shows a small part of my contacts and meetings, when we work in front of cameras. I hold such meetings and conferences nearly every day. They just sit down further away from me, just about three metres away. But we discuss things every day. I know that the real economy is not happy with increased interest rates. But if we do not do this, the situation will be like in Turkey. This is the problem. It is a serious matter and a major challenge. Of course, this instrument should be used carefully, but the Central Bank has an independent policy. This may seem strange to you, but I do not interfere with the Central Bank's operations. However, I have a positive view of them, and I believe that we usually manage to find a middle ground. Why? What are the risks of raising interest rates? This can hinder growth. We must grow faster that the world's average, by 3.4–3.5 percent a year in the near future, not even as high as now– by 4.6 percent. The target of 4.4–4.5 percent would be great. But increased interest rates are decreasing the possibility of attaining this goal. We cannot see this now, because the lending volume is not decreasing, and banking possibilities are growing. Sberbank will report 1 trillion rubles' worth of profits this year. In other words, we have found a middle ground, by and large. Dmitry Peskov: Let us move on. I suggest that we turn to RIA, the third of Russia's major news agencies. Mic to the central sector, please. Yelena Glushakova: Yelena Glushakova, RIA Novosti. Mr President, just now you were talking about social support measures, but the business side of the question is of no less importance. In your opinion, how can we balance anti-COVID restrictions with the need to keep the economy going? Not only major corporations suffer from restrictions, but small businesses too: retailers, small restaurants, cafes, small shops, the cinema industry, and the entertainment sector. If you allow me, I have a second question in this connection. How well did the governors perform? They received a lot of authority during the pandemic but used it in different ways, introducing various restrictions. In your opinion, how well did they perform? What grade would you give them for their efforts? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Let me start with the question on businesses and how we have been supporting them. You said that major corporations are not the only ones to suffer, and that small enterprises suffer as well. In fact, it is primarily small businesses that suffer, even if major corporations also felt some negative consequences. We devised support measures for these sectors, in fact, for all major sectors of the economy, if you remember, for all major corporations. I specifically asked the Government last year, at the very beginning of the year, and the Government complied. Our key industries and major corporations have clearly benefited from a number of measures. After all, they operated without any or virtually no interruptions, and in some cases even increased their output. This is the case for the defence industry, which reported higher production volumes. As for small and medium-size enterprises– catering, gyms, cinemas, and even theatres, museums, etc., all the enterprises in the service sector– of course, they were the first to suffer. However, they were also the first to receive our support. There was a whole range of measures. I do not know whether I need to list them all. This included subsidised loans, direct support to save jobs and wages, reduced interest rates, loan payments in installments, lease subsidies, etc. By the way, some of these measures are still in place, and you know this. We have allocated and continue to allocate large sums of money from the federal budget to this effect. The Government is doing this intentionally and understands what is going on. That said, it may well be that some things should have been done in a more sophisticated and responsive manner. Still, I would like to praise my colleagues' work. After all, this is all happening in direct contact with the business community. As you know, I recently attended events held by the Russian Union of Entrepreneurs and Industrialists and had meetings with the heads of other business associations, including those working with SMEs. Overall, these people have expressed their understanding and overall were quite positive about the Government's efforts to support businesses. Incidentally, the result was not bad at all. As I have said, we overcame the crisis faster than many other world economies. Our fall was not as bad and we came out of the crisis quicker. This is a result after all. Now, as regards… what is the second part of the question? Yelena Glushakova: About regional governors. Vladimir Putin: Assessment of the heads of the regions. You know, I have said many times and I would like to reiterate– I think you will agree with me: many countries have followed our path. Indeed, we were the first to say that ours is a large country and the situation in various regions is different and is developing in different ways. So, with overall guidance from the federal centre, and a government commission was set up for this purpose, we must still give the regions the opportunity to regulate the situation locally, considering the subtle nuances. Is it possible to compare, say, Chukotka and Moscow? They are completely different, and the epidemiological situation has been different from region to region because of our vast territory. Let me repeat, like any complex issue, some things could probably have been done better and with more urgency, but in general, the heads of the regions showed the utmost responsibility and were not afraid to make difficult decisions. In turn, the Government and the federal centre has always supported the regions that made the required decisions and needed assistance, say, from the federal centre. Assistance for the regions has been increased many times over. Cooperation between the federal centre and the regions has produced positive results, the results we needed. Dmitry Peskov: All right, let us go on. Let someone from the regions speak. There is a girl in a yellow blouse there. It says:""A City for Life."" Go ahead, please. Lyudmila Danilkina: Good afternoon, Veliky Novgorod, Lyudmila Danilkina. Our city that you, Mr President, have visited more than once, is not big but it is very beautiful and has an ancient history. I am talking about the city for a reason because my question is part personal and part business, about the urban environment. Which city would you personally choose to live in, except St Petersburg and Moscow? This is the first, personal part of my question. The second part is about Novgorod Region. Our region is very fortunately placed between the two capitals, which is, of course, a plus for our territory. But we would develop much faster if there were a high speed railway not far from Novgorod. There is a lot of talk about it now at both the federal and regional levels. I would like to know the prospects for the development or, to be more precise, implementation of this project on our territory. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: As for my place of residence, you said""other than Moscow and St Petersburg."" Why did you exclude Moscow and St Petersburg? These cities are part of the Russian Federation as well, and I was born in one of them. It is my hometown, so when you asked this question, my first thought was about St Petersburg. Our cities, large and small alike, are developing at a fairly fast pace, although we should focus primarily on developing small cities. We have been discussing this lately and are making efforts to expand infrastructure, primarily, to ensure transport connectivity both by rail and road, as well as by air, sea and river transport. I have already spoken about this, it is one of the growth drivers in which we plan to invest enormous resources. Much depends on connectivity, because one can and should be able to live in a favourable environment– I am not talking about myself– and to commute to work or change where you work. Increasing mobility of the population is one of our goals. So, it is possible, and I would, of course, think of St Petersburg first and foremost as my hometown. Krasnodar in the south of Russia is developing quite well. Look at how the coastal area and Crimea are developing. Now, speaking of infrastructure, we are talking about developing the Eastern Operating Domain, but not only. Let us say, Moscow–Kazan, and we plan to extend it further to Tyumen and then make it a loop. All of that makes the people feel they live in a favourable environment with easy commutes from their places of work to their homes, where they can meet with their friends and go to places catering to other aspects of life, such as cultural centres with internationally recognised museums, and so on. I think we have many beautiful and worthwhile places where people can and should feel comfortable. High-speed rail is a separate topic that is still in the works. First, if there is to be a high-speed railway, I think Veliky Novgorod should feel its presence, because even though it is high-speed rail, the train must stop somewhere. Veliky Novgorod is one such place where the train can make a stop. Moscow–St Petersburg air service will clearly cease to exist, because it will take just three hours to get from central Moscow to central St Petersburg, whereas now it can take up to 90 minutes to get to the airport in Moscow. So, air service on this route will no longer make sense. We need to weigh everything, think it over and have a look at high-speed rail in other countries. For example, the People's Republic of China has many such railway systems. Until recently, they were all operating at a loss, even in China with its population of 1.5 billion people. This is economics, and numbers must be taken into account. This is important for our country and can provide a solution for traveling certain distances. Air travel is a better solution in some places. These things are still being studied at the expert level. Thank you. Dmitry Peskov: Alexander Gamov, Komsomolskaya Pravda, please. Alexander Gamov: Thank you. Mr President, thank you very much for coming here today. Dmitry Peskov said it was your idea. If you do not mind, I would like to go back to the topic you and Mr Terekhov touched upon in the beginning. You meet with our academicians and experts. In your opinion, what is the reason for the new COVID-19 waves? Every new wave seems to be worse than the one before it. Just how confirmed is the effectiveness of vaccination really? How do scientists explain the fact that people contract this virus again even after vaccination and booster jabs? Why is the mortality rate so high? I do not think that the number has been mentioned today. The fact is that around 1,000 people in Russia die of coronavirus every day. I made a horrific discovery the other day. I looked at the global mortality rate, which was around 6,700 on that day. I realised that one in every six or seven deaths happened in Russia. Can we really allow this to continue? Mr President, I am saying this because, for example, in democratic Austria there are fines for those who refuse to get vaccinated. Perhaps we should introduce some criminal charges for those who campaign against doctor visits? You know, it occurred to me: you often say that Russia is having a hard time; that we are surrounded by enemies. I think we never could, and especially today, we simply cannot afford to lose one thousand people every day. Thank you very much. Perhaps, what we need is the political will of the country's leadership. Mr President, we will support you. You know what I mean. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Yes, I know what you mean. As for being surrounded by enemies, have I actually said that? True, there are military bases around us. To the east and to the south, and the north of Russia, new military systems have been installed, including at sea, to say nothing about the west. I think we will talk about this in the international relations section. Encircling a territory like ours is not an easy thing to do, although modern tools probably make it feasible in theory. Well, this is a separate topic. Speaking about new coronavirus strains and waves, what causes them is the virus's ability to mutate, nothing else. The answer is simple. Ever new strains emerge where there are problems in the healthcare system and low immunity. For example, in Africa, there is a high incidence of immunodeficiency, the human immunodeficiency virus– hence new coronavirus strains. It is not surprising at all. This is why I keep saying it is important to mutually recognise vaccines and make them available around the world as soon as possible in sufficient amounts. Otherwise, we will not be able to tackle this problem on a global scale and humanity will always live with this virus and sustain huge losses. We even have a new term: excess mortality. You know, this is simply terrible, but it is difficult to estimate the number of COVID deaths, and not because somebody is trying to hide the facts. Not at all. On the contrary, I have encouraged our healthcare system and the Government to keep everything as open as possible, clear and transparent, and also– I am absolutely sincere about this– because people must see the importance of vaccination. Why is the death rate so high? Vaccination coverage, herd immunity is quite low in the country, only 59.4 percent. Our neighbours are talking about the necessity of increasing the rate to 90–95 percent, while our figure is 59.4 percent, which explains the current situation. Should we try to prosecute people? No, I don't think so. The point at issue is not political will. The fact is everything has an equal and opposite reaction. When you apply pressure, our people, who are very ingenious, immediately devise methods to evade it, and they will do so in this case as well. We must pursue an alternative. We must respect people, whatever their position, and we must patiently explain the importance of taking specific measures. Take vaccination. You asked about the reason for COVID reinfection, etc. It is true that reinfection can and does happen. But do you know the reinfection rate among those who have recovered from the disease? People do get reinfected– your colleagues in this room, and our international media are writing about such cases. They write that those who have recovered from the virus can fall ill again. Yes, they can fall ill. But how many do? Only 1 percent of those who have recovered from COVID. And how many of those who have had the jab fall ill? Only 3 or 4 percent. And the number of vaccinated people in intensive care is much lower compared to non-vaccinated people. These are objective figures, and we simply need to tell people about them, to keep them informed. I have mentioned this before, but back in the Soviet era nobody asked your permission for vaccination. They just gave you the shot, and that was it. Those who stood at the helm of our big country in the Soviet period and contributed to its dissolution are now among the leaders of the anti-vaccination campaign. They are doing this to increase their popularity among the part of our people who are questioning the necessity of vaccination. This is a dishonest position. If they are competent and clever people who act responsibly with regard to their electorate, whom they must protect, they must take a principled stand rather than sit on the fence and try to gain popularity on the nation's health. It we act in a principled manner, trying to explain the necessity of vaccination to the people consistently, intelligibly and respectfully, I believe we will attain the desired effect. Any other method will be counterproductive. As for tightening accountability and so on, they are doing this in Germany, yet the vaccination rate is low. So, why do it? We must fight crime rather than law-abiding people. For example, there are falsified vaccination certificates. Over 200 such cases have been initiated, most of them under two articles: forgery and malfeasance. I believe that over 270 such cases have been opened. This is what we must fight. But on a more fundamental scale, we must explain and persuade. BBC, please. Petr Kozlov: Good afternoon, Mr President. Petr Kozlov, BBC Russian Service. Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon. Petr Kozlov: Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation and headquarters were designated as extremist organisations and disbanded this year. He is in prison now, after being poisoned, conducting an investigation into the poisoning and claiming to have identified the individuals involved. Over 100 media outlets have been put on the foreign agents' registry. Most of them were listed this year, actually, during the past six months. What happened in Russia recently for the number of those who the authorities consider extremists, undesirable organisations or foreign agents to have grown so fast? Let me say a few words about history. You often talk about history, and you know it. Probably, you remember that each time power in Russia was concentrated in the hands of one person in the absence of active opposition, when Russia was in a state of active, acute confrontation with the West, ultimately this situation prompted a response which plunged the country into the abyss of wars and revolutions. Do you not think that you, possessing all the power, are now laying the foundation, perhaps, for such wars and revolutions? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: First of all, speaking of history, as a reminder, our opponents have been saying throughout the centuries that Russia cannot be defeated, but can only be destroyed from within, which they successfully accomplished during World War I, or rather, after it ended, and then in the 1990s, when the Soviet Union was being dismantled from within. Who was doing it? Someone serving the interests of others that run counter to the interests of the Russian and other peoples of the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and the Russian Federation today. You mentioned the person who was allegedly poisoned. The Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation has sent multiple official inquiries asking to provide at least some materials corroborating that he was in fact poisoned. There are none. How can this be explained? Not a single thing about Novichok or whatever you call it. We suggested that our specialists go there and join the investigation. I spoke with the President of France and the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, asking them to allow our specialists to come, take samples and verify things, so that we can at least have some grounds to open a criminal case. No response whatsoever. We ask them: how can this be explained? Silence. So, there is no need to discuss it, let us turn the page if there is nothing to say in response. As for inmates, every country has always had them, and that is never going to change. Do not commit criminal offences under the guise of political activity. Next, regarding the list of media acting as foreign agents and media outlets designated as foreign agents. I agree with you, it's not good. But let me remind you once again that this law was not invented here; it was invented in a state that– you represent the UK here, and the UK is the closest ally of the United States– a state everyone considers to be the beacon of democracy. The United States adopted this act back in the 1930s, but this is not the point. What is important is that it is in effect now. It is in force today. About 0.034[percent] organisations have been labelled foreign agents there. Is this surprising now? We have the same share of foreign agents, 0.034, the same number. What is the difference? The difference is that in the United States, if you have not shut down, you face criminal liability, up to five years in prison. Even if you stop any activity and close the organisation it does not exempt you from criminal liability– five years. We do nothing like that. We do not prohibit the work of these organisations; we just want organisations that are engaged in internal political activity in Russia to clearly explain and disclose the sources of funding for their operations. That is all, they can continue doing what they are doing. Our law is much more liberal. If you think this is not enough, if, like your colleague here, you think we need to introduce liability, administrative or criminal, for failure to get vaccinated– why don't we introduce criminal liability for foreign agents' operations if the organisation fails to close, like in the US? But we do not even demand termination of their operations– we just want them to be honest about their sources of funding. There may be questions about the understanding of'political activity.' I agree with you here. There may be questions about regulating this kind of activity. We have 74 organisations designated as foreign agents of 200,000 registered NGOs– that's 0.034. Just like in the States, but we do not have such severe penalties, which include criminal liability. Now, regarding keeping power in the same hands. We have distinct branches of power– the executive, legislative and judicial authorities. Clearly, the delineation of authority between these branches can have minor variations depending on the specific country at a specific stage of its development. We will strive to ensure that they are independent, so that the country is cohesive, efficient and forward-looking. And in the end, it will be up to the Russian people to choose their system of society and state, not up to those who you serve today. Next, please. Dmitry Peskov: Let us continue. I suggest giving the floor to the television channels Vladimir Putin: Of course. Dmitry Peskov: I see NTV, Irada Zeinalova. You do not need to introduce yourself. Irada Zeinalova: Good afternoon, Mr President, colleagues. Since we were talking about history, I would say that things are happening almost according to[Alexander] Gorchakov, who said,""Russia is focusing."" Of course, we would like to focus on our internal problems, to address our internal affairs. However, over the past few weeks the global media have been fuelling tension, saying that the Russians are coming, Russia is planning to attack Ukraine and wants war. Serious people call you, and you talk with them and explain our position, but they do not calm down. As a result, we send our proposals, establish our'red lines' and, roughly speaking, explain the rules of the game, which, you must agree, did not exist before. For the past 30 years, we have been living in a swamp and have been told that we do not meet certain standards. We have set our red lines, and we know that we have outlined our security priorities and interests. But we also remember from history that any agreement reached during negotiations can remain on paper, the way it happened many times in the past. The smallest provocation after such talks can lead to a big war, and the agreements remain on paper or are forgotten again. So, here is my question. Mr President, what should we prepare for? What is a realistic outlook, and since the word""war"" has been said out-loud, have we estimated the probability of war even as the result of a provocation? Vladimir Putin: You brought up Gorchakov and the end of his phrase,""Russia is focusing."" You may also recall that the first part of the phrase– in reply to a question about whether Russa was angry– was,""No, Russia is not angry, Russia is focusing."" I will try to give a short answer, yet I will have to begin at the beginning. The aggravation began in 2014. Before that, even though the Soviet Union had ceased to exist and part of historically Russian territories with a historically Russian population, primarily in Ukraine, had found themselves living outside Russia, we accepted that as a fact of life and felt more or less comfortable about it. We even helped those new republics to get back on their feet, and we worked, were ready to work and are still working together with their governments, whatever their foreign policy priorities. Suffice it to recall our relations with President[Viktor] Yushchenko and Prime Minister[Yulia] Timoshenko, who indicated, like the current Ukrainian leadership, their absolutely pro-Western position. But we worked with them anyway. It is true that we argued over gas, and there were conflicts, but eventually we came to an agreement, and we worked, and were ready to continue to work together, and we never even thought about doing anything about Crimea. But what happened in 2014? A bloody coup, people were killed and burned alive. I am not talking now about who was right and who was to blame. Obviously, Ukrainian citizens were rightfully indignant and displeased at what was happening in the country. The then president, Yanukovych, had agreed to everything. Three foreign ministers– of Poland, Germany and France– guaranteed the peaceful development of the situation and the peace process. I talked with the US president at that time at his initiative. He asked me to support this process as well. Everyone agreed but then a coup took place in a day or two. What for? There is no answer. Why was it needed? President Yanukovych agreed to everything anyway. He was ready to give up power anytime. The elections and the victory of the opposition were inevitable. Everyone knew this very well. Why was it done then? Then Crimea happened. But how could we turn down the request of Sevastopol and Crimea, the people who lived there, to take them under our protection, under our wing? It was not possible. We were simply put in a situation where we could not have acted differently. Or were we supposed to just look on passively at what was happening in the southeast, in Donbass, which has only ever thought of itself as part of Russia, even during the formation of the USSR in 1922–1924? But Lenin and his comrades wedged Donbass in there by force. At first, they decided to make it part of Russia and then said the decision had to be revised. They revised it and created a country that had never existed before. We will not talk about it now, but this is what happened then. They crammed in there the historical lands of people whom nobody asked how or where they wanted to live. All right, this is what happened, we agreed. But we had to do something in 2014 and this led to the crisis that is unfolding today. All right, the Ukrainian authorities twice attempted to resolve the Donbass problem by force although we persuaded them not to do this. I personally persuaded Mr Poroshenko: Anything but military operations! Yes, yes, he said and then resorted to force. What was the result? Encirclement, losses and the Minsk agreements. Are they good or not? I think they are the only possible way out. So, what is the problem? There is no desire to implement them. They adopted a law on indigenous people and announced that the Russian people who lived on this land, on their own land, were not indigenous. Incidentally, the same was done to Poles, Hungarians and Romanians. Hence the disputes in Ukraine's relations with these countries. They exist. They do not get a lot of attention, but they are there. Language came next. The Russians and the Russian-speaking population are being forced from their historical lands– that is what is happening. All right. Everyone says: Russia must abide by the Minsk agreements. We agreed. But they, the government suddenly submitted to parliament a law on a transitional period. How does it tally with the Minsk agreements? Instead of amnesty, this law provides for a ban on amnesty, all but criminal liability for amnesty. Instead of elections, this law introduces military government, and instead of amnesty– lustration. What is all this about? And they got it approved by the Venice Commission. So, how are we supposed to react to all this? This is the domestic policy component. But then we hear: war, war, war. You could get the impression that maybe a third military operation is in the making. Moreover, they are warning us in advance:""Do not interfere, do no protect these people. If you do interfere to protect these people, certain sanctions will follow."" It may well be that they are preparing for this. This is the first option we need to respond to, and act, while keeping this in mind. The second option is, in general, to create, as I said in my article, an anti-Russia of sorts on this territory by constantly stockpiling the latest weapons there and brainwashing the local population. Just imagine how Russia must live and carry on, from a historical perspective? Do we have to live, while constantly keeping an eye on what is going on over there, and what new weapons' systems were delivered? Under the cover of these new weapons' systems radicals may well decide to settle the Donbass issue, as well as the Crimean issue, by military means. Why did they support the Crimean Platform? On the sidelines they keep saying:""Fine, let's forget about Crimea."" But no! They mean to get even there. After all, we have to be mindful of our own security, not just for today and not just for next week, but in the short term. How is Russia to live with all this? Do we always have to stay on guard, watching what happens there and when a strike might come? This is a serious matter. I have just spoken about our plans for infrastructure development, social policy, and healthcare. But what does it all mean if we end up in the conflict you are asking about? This is not our choice, and we do not want this. It is for this reason that I responded to President Biden's proposal, who suggested appointing responsible representatives to lead strategic stability talks. Stability and security, ensuring security on this territory and in this area is one of the key matters on today's agenda. We must understand how to ensure our security. With this in mind, we spoke out clearly and directly against any further eastward expansion by NATO. The ball is in their court. They need to respond in one way or another. In this connection, I would like to emphasise that the overall response we have been seeing has been quite positive. Our American partners are telling us that they are ready to launch this conversation by starting talks early next year in Geneva. Both sides have appointed representatives. I hope that the situation develops in this very direction. Dmitry Peskov: Let us take questions from regional media. Vladimir Putin: Mr Peskov, allow me. I see China. Dmitry Peskov: Xinhua, I assume? Vladimir Putin: I do not know. It says""China."" Please. Dmitry Peskov: Please, pass the mic. Xinhua, please raise it higher. Vladimir Putin: I meant that person though. But alright. They are not giving you the floor. Dmitry Peskov: I apologise. Vladimir Putin: I am sorry, they are not giving you the floor. Bureaucracy is to blame. Ao Li: Good afternoon, Mr President. Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon. Ao Li: Xinhua news agency, China. You recently held talks with President of China Xi Jinping via videoconference. You remarked that Russia‒China relations are a true example of cooperation between states in the 21st century. Today, in view of the current complicated international situation, how should we understand this description? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: That is exactly how you should understand it. There is no hidden meaning. Indeed, the relationship between the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation has evolved to be as I described it. Perhaps you noticed that President Xi Jinping and I always address each other as""my friend."" And it is true: we have a very trusting personal relationship that helps our professional relationship as well. In terms of the economy, first of all, Asia is a rapidly and successfully developing region, and China is the absolute leader of both the global and Asian economy. It is only natural that we are developing our economic relationship with China. Bilateral trade currently exceeds US$100 billion, which is above the pre-pandemic level. China is our biggest trade and economic partner with which we cooperate in many different fields. In terms of energy, both China and Russia committed to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. But before that deadline, we will be supplying all types of energy resources to China. We are willing to continue beyond the deadline because life will not stop in our countries in 2060, and there are many ways to achieve carbon neutrality, even while still using hydrocarbons, provided that they are used appropriately. We continue to cooperate in nuclear energy, high technology and space– in almost every industry, including technology-intensive sectors. Our people-to-people cooperation includes organising mutual years of youth exchanges, years of science, education, culture and so on. These initiatives, of course, bring people together at the most basic level, in humanitarian sphere. We cooperate on security. The Chinese army is extensively equipped with the most advanced weapons. We even develop some technologically advanced weapons together. We cooperate in space and aviation, on both airplanes and helicopters. Finally, we promote cooperation between our armed forces through joint military exercise and international military games, joint maritime and air patrols. Ours is an overarching partnership of strategic nature that has no precedents in history, at least not between Russia and China. This daily hard work benefits both the Chinese and Russian people. It is, of course, a strong stabilising factor in the international arena. There is a sign saying""Children"", so we will not go further into international affairs.""Protection of children"". Dmitry Peskov: Yes, the sign saying""Protection of Children."" Shamil Guliyev: Good afternoon, Mr President. I am Shamil Guliyev from Tobolskoye Vremya. The problem of harmful content that children find on the internet remains a pressing one, as you have said before. This results in bullying at schools and various types of incitement, among other provocations. Some time ago, the introduction of registration on social media with passport data was discussed. Could you please say if this will happen eventually? And what other measures might be taken to protect teenagers from potentially dangerous content that they might come across on social media? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: I totally agree with you, Shamil. This is a problem not only for Russia. Look, this topic is being debated almost in all countries, both in the media and in representative bodies of power. This issue is being debated in the US Congress, and representatives of these global networks and global platforms are summoned there. What does this mean for us? Business above all and, unfortunately, money at any cost. It means evading national oversight, evading the need to give some thought to children, as your question indicated. The priority for them is making a profit. Hence all the negativity associated with it: the encouragement of suicide, the same tragedies in schools over and over. Consider it, we have prevented over 100 cases of such serious crime at educational institutions recently. Unfortunately, these tragedies happen and we have to contend with a steady stream of them. However, more than 100 have been prevented; 127 if I am not mistaken. Of course, this is an enormous problem for the entire world, including us. And it naturally results in demands to""ground"" these platforms so that they have to open offices here to comply with national laws. Speaking about ending anonymity on the internet, this is also being debated in our society and all over the world. The internet is part of our lives, and an ever bigger part of it at that. So, everything happening on the internet must comport with the general rules of human life, both moral and legal ones. Of course, all that is required is to observe the golden mean, as in many things, not to suppress freedom of expression and freedom to distribute information on the internet, while also protecting our society from possible negative effects, which you have just mentioned. I hope that the golden mean will be found and we will also continue to insist on working with global platforms so that they follow our laws. As you know, a lot of countries slow down traffic; there are also other ways, including essentially blocking them completely. We are very reluctant to take such extreme measures, but if we are forced to, we will have to make greater demands on those who work in this area and neglect the interests of the Russian society. Dmitry Peskov: By the way, I saw some bloggers on the list of accredited journalists. Are you here? Show me please, if there are any bloggers present. Please introduce yourself. Anya Khilkevich: Good afternoon. My name is Anya Khilkevich. I represent a social network called Yappy. I heard what my colleague said, and I have a question. The development of all these digital services opens up enormous opportunities, including in education. Teaching and communicating information to young people is possible through entertaining and game-based content. Yappy is a convenient app for viewing and creating original videos, for trying creative ideas. So my question is: what do you think about interacting with young people through this kind of environment? Or do you think the younger generation is degrading? Vladimir Putin: Why degrading? Anya Khilkevich: I mean they are not developing, evolving. Vladimir Putin: Of course not. Humankind is always evolving and children are always better and smarter than their parents. It is an obvious fact because more information is accumulated and communication improves. People have more and more opportunity to be creative. They do not just run faster or jump higher but also think in less conventional and more creative ways. What is the core of education today, especially for younger children? Games. Of course we must use the opportunities you are talking about. This is why, by the way, we are working to expand the broadband internet network to the entire country. We have a specific plan and funding. We are about to finish connecting schools to the internet and will soon start with rural areas. I believe we have allocated about 24 billion rubles for this project, and Russian Post will be involved. Despite the debate about whether a commercial organisation like Russian Post should be supported, I think it should. Then people living in rural areas will be able to use its facilities and enjoy the opportunities you mentioned. This is not a problem. The problem is that the content should be useful. Young people should not become addicted to the internet. Browsing the internet from dawn until dusk should not be a substitute for real life. There needs to be some kind of movement, a full life, with sports, museums and theatres. The internet opportunities you mentioned and the various networks must complement real life rather than cause people to plunge into a virtual world and live a virtual life all the time. That would indeed lead to degradation. To prevent this, representative government bodies, parliaments, public organisations and non-profits must work together to develop certain rules of behaviour. Dmitry Peskov: Maybe we should give the floor to foreign media. Sky News. Diana Magnay: Thank you for taking my question. I am afraid it is in English. You have talked a lot about security guarantees, and now we have seen your proposals. You also say you have no intention of invading Ukraine. So, will you guarantee unconditionally that you will not invade Ukraine or any other sovereign country? Or does that depend on how negotiations go? And another question: what is it, do you think, that the West does not understand about Russia or about your intentions? Thank you Vladimir Putin: Regarding your question about guarantees or whether things depend on the negotiations, our actions will not depend on the negotiation process, but rather on unconditional guarantees for Russia's security today and in the historical perspective. In this connection, we have made it clear that any further movement of NATO to the East is unacceptable. Is there anything unclear about this? Are we deploying missiles near the US border? No, we are not. It is the United States that has come to our home with its missiles and is already standing at our doorstep. Is it going too far to demand that no strike systems be placed near our home? What is so unusual about this? What would the Americans say if we stationed our missiles on the border between Canada and the United States, or between Mexico and the United States? Haven't Mexico and the US had territorial disputes in the past? Which country owned California? And Texas? Have you forgotten? All right, nobody is talking about this now the way they are talking about Crimea. Very well. But we are trying to avoid talking about the creation of Ukraine as well. Who created it? Vladimir Lenin did, when he established the Soviet Union. This is set out in the 1922 Treaty on the creation of the Soviet Union and in the 1924 Constitution. True, this happened after his death, but in accordance with the principles he formulated. But the matter at hand concerns security, not history, but security guarantees. This is why it is not the negotiations themselves but the results that matter to us. We remember, as I have mentioned many times before and as you know very well, how you promised us in the 1990s that[NATO] would not move an inch to the East. You cheated us shamelessly: there have been five waves of NATO expansion, and now the weapons systems I mentioned have been deployed in Romania and deployment has recently begun in Poland. This is what we are talking about, can you not see? We are not threatening anyone. Have we approached US borders? Or the borders of Britain or any other country? It is you who have come to our border, and now you say that Ukraine will become a member of NATO as well. Or, even if it does not join NATO, that military bases and strike systems will be placed on its territory under bilateral agreements. This is the point. And you are demanding guarantees from me. It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now, instead of talking about it for decades and doing what you want, while talking quietly about the need for security guarantees to everyone. This is the point. Are we threatening anyone? Now to your second question. Repeat it, please. Diana Magnay: What is it that you think that the West does not understand about Russia or about your intentions? Vladimir Putin: Does the West understand or fail to understand something? You know, sometimes I get the feeling we live in different worlds. I just talked about things that are obvious. How can you not understand them? They told us: there will be no expansion, but they expanded. They promised us equal guarantees for all under several international treaties. But this equal security has failed to materialise. Look, back in 1918, an aide to US President Woodrow Wilson said that it would be a relief for the entire world if instead of one huge Russia, that a separate state in Siberia and another four countries in the European part be created. In 1991, we divided ourselves into 12, I believe, parts, and we did this ourselves. Still, it seems that this was not enough for our partners. They believe that Russia is too big as it is today. This is because the European countries themselves turned into small states. Instead of vast empires, they are now small states with 60 to 80 million people. However, even after the Soviet Union collapsed, and we were left with just 146 million, it is still too much for them. I believe that this is the only way to explain this unrelenting pressure. Take the 1990s, for example. The Soviet Union did everything to build normal relations with the West and the United States. I have said this many times, and I will repeat it, so that your listeners and viewers understand. I do not recall what media outlet you represent, but this is not the point. We had representatives from American intelligence services at our nuclear, military facilities; monitoring Russia's nuclear weapons sites was their job. They went there every day and even lived there. Many advisors, including CIA staffers, worked in the Russian Government. What else did you need? Why did they have to support terrorists in the North Caucasus and use organisations of a clearly terrorist nature in attempts to break the Russian Federation apart? But they did this, and as former Director of the Federal Security Service, I know this all too well. We worked with double agents, and they reported to us on the objectives set for them by Western intelligence services. But why? They should have treated Russia as a potential ally, and made it stronger, but it all went in the opposite direction; they wanted to break it down even further. And then they started expanding NATO eastwards. Of course, we told them not to do this, arguing that they promised not to. But they asked us:""Do you have any paper record? No? If not, go away, we don't care about your concerns."" This continued year after year, every time we showed our teeth and tried to prevent something and voice our concerns. But no: they did not want to hear anything, saying that they would do what they considered necessary. There were one, two, three, four, five– five waves of expansion. What is it they don't understand? I don't know. You can say that this is all abundantly clear. I do believe that it is clear as daylight: we want to ensure our security. Dmitry Peskov: Regions. I see you, Kaluga. Tatyana Zimushina: Good afternoon, I am Tatyana Zimushina from Kaluga Region, Nika TV. I would like to go back to the topic of coronavirus. The danger this virus poses has already been mentioned here but other diseases have not vanished into thin air. Therefore, it is important to also think about regular healthcare. It is being affected by a shift towards designating more hospital beds for Covid patients, and there are also other restrictions. Regular healthcare is being cut and, judging by media reports in other regions, it was suspended altogether in some municipalities during the pandemic. Can we avoid this outcome? Or will we see more closures in the event of another serious new wave of the disease? Can this be rectified? My second question is about post-Covid medical screening. It was announced last summer and it has also been launched in our region. Are you keeping track of it and are you being updated on its outcomes? Has this medical screening proved to be effective and did it help many people? Vladimir Putin: As for regular healthcare, indeed, it was severely affected during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. But it was expected, as we had to modify some hospitals and clinics to free up beds for Covid-19 patients. This is my first point. The second, as it was necessary to have enough healthcare professionals, or doctors, some of them had to undergo retraining, including general practitioners and specialists, to learn how to fight Covid-19. They were also in short supply. Now, in connection with this, the scheme of referring patients for treatment had to be changed, that is, if some healthcare institutions switched to Covid treatment, patients were referred to other hospitals or clinics to make sure that routine medical care is provided without interruption. Some clinics ended up closing for good, while others closed for cleaning after treating Covid patients. There were quite a few problems. During the initial phase there was a shortage of masks, medical gloves and the necessary clothing. This put an even greater strain on the healthcare system. I hope we have dealt with all the challenges. I hope we will no longer have any shortages, although we recently had some issue with oxygen. But the Armed Forces and industry have helped us with this challenge. Once again, I hope that none of this will happen in the future. Volunteers have joined us, university professors and senior students, too. On the whole, we have rallied together and got a grip, to be able to effectively respond to these threats. One thing we focus on besides preventive measures is post-COVID rehabilitation. We have allocated the necessary resources. How is this work going? Unfortunately, not as efficiently as we would like. I don't remember whether I already said this or not– only 1 million Russians have taken advantage of this check-up system. This system should actually work steadily and systematically, unaffected by any COVID restrictions, difficulties or other challenges. But post-COVID rehabilitation, post-COVID check-ups are quite effective. Here, too, there are certain difficulties and prejudices, maybe. People are often afraid to visit medical centres like this, afraid of new infections. I want to say that our specialists, doctors are doing everything they can to ensure the health safety of people who come in for rehabilitation, for a medical examination, as well as to provide help because people who have had COVID really need it very much. We all know that COVID hits all body systems– the vascular system, the internal organs– the heart, the kidneys, the liver and brain can be affected, so patients need rehabilitation. A very good system has been created and tested. I hope it will expand, I really do. The conditions have been created for this. Dmitry Peskov: Let us continue. Channel One, please. Pavel Krasnov: Thank you. Pavel Krasnov, Channel One. Mr President, the issue of gas is dominating minds, above all in Europe, of course. We are seeing an extremely acute gas crisis. However, when it broke out and prices soared, we started to hear endless accusations directed at Gazprom and Russia in general with ever increasing frequency. Another round of accusations on restricting supplies via the Yamal-Europe pipeline came the other day. Generally speaking, the accusations are contradictory: we are accused of monopolising the market, while also not supplying enough gas. Yesterday, our Ukrainian neighbours made some news. Naftogaz again asked the European Commission for nothing less than to compel Gazprom to offer more gas for sale. This seems funny, of course, but the Europeans are not in a laughing mood. The situation in Europe is very difficult: gas prices set an absolute record– more than $2,000. This never happened before and was impossible to even imagine. But is Gazprom to blame for this? Mr President, here is my question: is there at least a tiny grain of truth in these accusations against Gazprom? Vladimir Putin: Certainly not. There is no truth to them. This is like trying to say that down is up. Our colleague here asked what the West does not understand. They lie all the time. This is why they are muddying the waters. Gazprom supplies all the gas requested by our counterparties under their contracts. Moreover, it has even increased supplies by almost 12 percent, I think, or by about 20 percent if we exclude Russia's immediate neighbours. Overall, it is increasing supplies to Europe as well. In my opinion, this is the only country, the only global company that behaves like this. I have already said at many meetings, including international events, that American suppliers withdrew considerable amounts from Europe, from the European market, I believe. I think the total amounts to 14 million tonnes of LNG. They took it to premium markets, first to Latin America, to Brazil, and then to Asia: China, South Korea and Japan. Because they pay more for this gas. The Europeans thought they had premium markets, but no. It appears that these markets are in other places as well. Prices began to soar. There are many factors: bad weather, a long and cold spring last year, a shortage of gas in underground storage facilities and windmills failing to work. All this contributed to the shortage. In the process, government authorities are harassing their oil and gas companies, which do not invest enough in expanding production as a result. This is how the shortage emerged. They did not pump enough gas into underground storage facilities and now they are taking it out in a big way. Of course, this is a problem. Now some Western operators are storing their gas in Ukraine's underground facilities. They are actively withdrawing it and using it in their own countries. This is understandable since the gas from underground facilities is many times cheaper than on the market. We were saying– and I want to repeat it– that there was no point in destroying long-term contracts. The European Commission was telling us: no, it is necessary to move to market relations, the market will set it right. This is how the market made its adjustment– over $2,000 for a thousand cubic metres. Take it. No! You are correct, just yesterday they were shouting: help, this is Russia and Gazprom expanding and taking over the market. We are not taking over anything. Indeed, we supply a lot, but we are not the only suppliers to the European market. However, we are probably the only ones who are increasing our supplies. We are being told to pump to cover the needs of the spot market, since they need to first meet the demand of their counterparties under long-term contracts. Look at what is happening. Germany is our largest consumer in Europe. I might have my numbers off a little, but they take about 50–51 billion cubic metres a year. We supplied an extra 5.6 billion cubic metres there, which is more than 10 percent. Listen, this is a decent amount. We supplied an extra 4.4 billion cubic metres of natural gas to Italy. You just mentioned the Yamal–Europe natural gas pipeline. I see Russia and Gazprom accused of Gazprom failing to book capacity for gas supplies to Europe via the Yamal–Europe route for the second or third day in a row. That is disgusting, how should I put it… Well, okay. This is just totally out of line. After all, it failed to book capacity, because its counterparties and companies, mostly German and French, who buy gas from this route, failed to submit bids for purchase. What is there to transit if Gazprom has not received purchase requests? What did they do then? They turned on this route in reverse mode and have been pumping gas from Germany to Poland for several days now. I think everyone would find it interesting. Why? Because we supply gas to Germany under long-term contracts at prices that are three, four, six, or even seven times lower than on the spot market. Should you resell even 1 billion cubic metres of gas, you will make almost a billion dollars, 900 million plus. This is business. This is my first point. They have stocked up on gas, having received from us 5.6 billion cubic metres on top of what is provided under long-term contracts, and are now reselling it. But there is more to it. After all, they are pumping gas in reverse mode, so how can it be supplied in the other direction? Gas cannot move in both directions in one pipe at the same time. So, they: a) failed to place an order; b) turned it on in reverse mode. But this is only a portion of the information. There is a connecting pipe that connects the Polish pipeline system with the Ukrainian system. The volume is about 3 million cubic metres per day. This is exactly the amount that Germany is supplying to Poland. I have every reason to believe that this gas is eventually supplied to Ukraine. Consumers in Europe and Germany should know what is really happening, and, perhaps, ask certain authorities to clarify their stance. Instead of supplying gas to Poland and then to Ukraine in an effort to help someone tide over, it would be better to continue supplies to Europe, Germany, for instance, and to reduce the spot price, because the more product on the market, the lower the price. No, they began to pump in reverse. This is the problem. How is Gazprom involved in this? So let them tend to their business and address their issues in time and not think that they are so smart and that God fell asleep on them. They should address the problems of their own making, and we are willing to help them do so, which is what we are doing. I think I just made a convincing case for it. Dmitry Peskov: Let us continue in this sector. Mir Channel, please. Guzel Kamayeva: Good afternoon, Mr President. Good afternoon, colleagues. Guzel Kamayeva, Mir Television and Radio Company. Mr President, your meeting with the President of Belarus is scheduled for the end of this year. You are going to meet for the sixth time this year. When will the citizens of Russia and Belarus feel some tangible results of the Union State roadmap? Free mobile roaming maybe, a unified document flow, as an option? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: We actually have a long list of cooperation options to bring our economies closer together and to make them more competitive. There is more than just roaming, although it definitely should be on the agenda. I certainly agree with you– people should actually feel the changes. But we have already done a lot, especially on social matters. I am referring to free movement, the labour market situation, and even social security in a number of areas. At present, we are trying to synchronise taxes, customs procedures, and laws. This is extremely important to ensure a uniform understanding of how we should work together to achieve the best result. These are, in fact, fundamental things– the fiscal policy, laws and customs. It has been a long and difficult process of coordinating our approaches. I must say that Mr Lukashenko and his entire team are not easy negotiators, but we have generally reached an understanding of the pace we should move at and the steps we should take in this direction. This concerns access to the procurement market for goods and services organised by the state, by Belarusian economic operators. This concerns transport and many other matters. Therefore, I am sure that our citizens will feel it, feel the impact on their lives. You know, it is not going to just fall from the sky, like manna from heaven, all of a sudden. But there are obvious things that ensure our competitiveness. We are building the Union State. But the level of integration is still far lower than in the European Union; it is simply incomparable. I am not even talking about a single currency, never mind that. Perhaps it will be a subject for the future if our respective economic services come to an agreement on this score. But first, we need to synchronise our economic laws including antimonopoly laws, and tax and customs regulations. We have agreed on this; we have agreed, and now we will start working. I am sure that there will be results. I see a sign that says""Rubbish."" It is such a mundane thing but it concerns millions of people, and we should talk about things that people are concerned about. Kristina Burmakina: Good afternoon, Mr President, Good afternoon, colleagues, Kristina Burmakina, Online47, Leningrad Region. Here is my question. The Leningrad Region is actively reforming its waste management system: local officials are shutting down landfills and selecting sites for waste recycling facilities. But there is a problem: the same activists who advocated shutting down landfills are now protesting against recycling plants. Whatever spot you show them on the map, they will say:""Anywhere else, on the Moon– but not here."" So the question is: how can we persuade people and what should be our communication strategy? Vladimir Putin: You should address this question to the governor of the Leningrad Region. I want to say that overall, the so-called rubbish reform is moving forward, despite the difficulties. Of course, the main goal is to resolve this issue in general but one of the essential midway tasks is to set up operators. By now, they have been set up in almost every Russian region. They are operating and the number of sites has increased multiple times over. One of the first steps was to ensure that different types of waste are collected and stored separately. In some regions, we are ahead of schedule on this task. The current progress is around 40 percent, according to the reports I have. This is ahead of schedule. The same goes for waste recycling facilities. The same goes for new modern landfills. Rubbish has to be disposed of somehow. There are options such as recycling, burning and other methods of disposal. There is waste that is impossible to destroy at this point so it has to be kept in landfills– but these should be modern landfills that are properly equipped and are located far away from residential areas. We are working on all these options and working fast, ahead of schedule. It is not a bad result. Of course, there is always the issue of explaining to people that building waste management facilities is a reasonable solution for economic and environmental considerations. We need to show people how these facilities operate. Modern waste recycling facilities do not have to be located far from St Petersburg or major residential areas in the Leningrad Region. They can be located in big cities. Take Japan, for example: their waste recycling plants are located in the middle of cities with millions of residents, with hardly any negative impact on the environment or living conditions. We simply need to show this. Instead of doing it on the sly, explain it to people beforehand. There may be other advantages to it like more jobs and higher wages. This is the way to go and the way to reach consensus. Dmitry Peskov: Let us hear from Volgograd, the very top. Vladimir Putin: Wait, I see the FSIN[Federal Penitentiary Service] sign here. Let that lady have the microphone. Kseniya Sobchak: Mr President, after it was published… Dmitry Peskov: Please introduce yourself. Kseniya Sobchak: Kseniya Sobchak, Ostorozhno Novosti. Vladimir Putin: I cannot see you; you are too far away. Kseniya Sobchak: That is why I am wearing red. Vladimir Putin: Fine. Go ahead. Kseniya Sobchak: After the Gulagu.net website made the archives of torture public, you fired the head of the Federal Penitentiary Service by executive order. My team and I have just returned from Irkutsk. We continue following the video archives, and people there are talking a lot about General Leonid Sagalakov, who is the head of the regional FSIN. He was promoted to general not long ago. Clearly, you sign lots of executive orders like that, but I would like to know if you are getting objective information about these people? Because there is much evidence that this person took part in the torture, according to available testimony. Here, too, it is important who is bringing you files to build a case for promotion. More recently, a draft law was introduced to the State Duma to expand the notion of""torture"" and toughen punishment for practicing it. Mr Peskov has already said, I quote:""No presidential initiative is anticipated with regard to this draft law."" What does that mean? Do you agree that torture in Russian prisons has become systemic? How can we deal with this state of affairs? You have seen or have been shown for certain or were told about these video archives. Do you have your own personal and emotional attitude towards this problem? The number of inmates who have been raped or tortured to death is high, more than 300 people at the most heinous SIZO-1 detention centre in Irkutsk alone. The law enforcement officers whom we communicated with told us there are different ways to overcome this problem, one of which is to strip the pre-trial detention centres of the preliminary investigation function, because they are just torture chambers with developers assigned to them. The developers are people who should be convicted on serious felony charges, but have been instead making a home at these pre-trial detention centres for years and engaging in torturing inmates. Each of these torture chambers is assigned to a particular department in order to improve crime solving statistics from the Investigative Committee and so on. Tell us about this; what will be done and will you personally supervise this issue? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Regarding torture and, in general, degrading and cruel treatment of inmates, unfortunately, this is not just Russia's problem. If you look at what is going on at correctional facilities in other countries, you will see that they have as many problems as we do. This is a worldwide problem. Probably, there are countries and facilities where things look problem-free. However, there are lots of facilities in Europe, France, for example, or the United States, which, I think, do not exist even in third world countries. This is my first point. Second, we are talking about developing the penitentiary system and the construction of new facilities. Take the Kresty prison in the Leningrad Region; we did build new blocks. Incidentally, this was done, in part, after I visited it– a long time ago though– and issued instructions. This must be done, because even the exterior of prisons is important. As for the essence of the question, what information am I using? I use information from various sources. Not that someone brings me a document that makes me happy and I sign it. No, I analyse proposals like this based on the information that comes from different sources– I would like to emphasise this, after which I put my signature on it. Are mistakes possible? Yes, it happens sometimes; life is complicated and diverse, and nothing can change this. But in this case, and considering what you have told us, the assessment of this situation must be based on information acquired during an investigation. Seventeen criminal cases have been opened and are being investigated. You have mentioned one or two persons, but I believe that over a dozen people have been fired and are being investigated. Let us look into the matter and figure it out. I can assure you that not a single investigator has a personal interest in that case. This is the reason we separated the Investigative Committee from the Prosecutor's Office. They are not connected, these two organisations, let alone prisons, which are subordinate to the Justice Ministry, not even the Interior Ministry, although it has been said many times that the penitentiary system should return to its old place to ensure effective investigations. Yes, there is a problem. We should work at it calmly with a scrupulous and comprehensive investigation, at least an investigation of crimes that have been committed, and what we are talking about is definitely a crime. And the investigation must be brought to its logical conclusion, so that everyone can see that punishment for such crimes is inevitable. I believe that in this case we can reach a positive result. Of course, we must also use the capabilities of human rights organisations. These questions are always raised during my meetings with members of the Human Rights Council, and I try to respond to them accordingly. This includes prison conditions, healthcare in prisons, and treatment of inmates. I would like to point out once again that of course, people in prisons are criminals, and the inmates in pretrial detention centres are suspected of having committed crimes, but they are Russian citizens, they are human beings and must be treated humanely. Let's work together to improve this situation. Dmitry Peskov: This is to remind everyone that it is probably time to replace your facemasks. Let us follow doctors' recommendations and replace our masks. Ekho Moskvy, please. Maxim Kurnikov: Maxim Kurnikov, Ekho Moskvy. Mr President, I would like to continue with the topic that my colleague from Sky News began. She asked for some guarantees, and you said we would not give any guarantees. But you have already spoken with Biden several times, at least twice, as far as we know, and I want to understand how you see this situation. Do you have the same vision for the future of Donbass, and the future of the Minsk agreements? Because when later we hear statements from the White House, and statements from Mr Peskov, it sounds as if many things coincide, or seems to coincide, and yet the word'war' is heard increasingly often. Here we are, discussing the possibility of war. But at this very moment, Ukrainians are probably watching us and spitting at the screen, because war already came to their land in 2014, and they actually hold you and me responsible for it. They might not be aware of the details of who issues which orders, but they actually believe Russia is already at war with Ukraine. You refused to give guarantees. How do you see it? I received calls from listeners the day before yesterday, and we talked about how their families were discussing a possible war with Ukraine. And actually, it is shocking enough just to say the words. How do these thoughts appear inside your head, what do you think about this, is it possible? How can one give an order to a Russian soldier to shoot at a Ukrainian one, and vice versa? And one more short remark. There are people who could not attend this news conference, and my colleague from Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Muratov, a Nobel prize winner, gave me a question for you. I will read it out, so as not to miss a single word:""Mr President, do you personally know the names of those who ordered the murders of Politkovskaya and Nemtsov?"" Vladimir Putin: Let us start with the last part. I made every effort to see these cases solved; all the necessary instructions, directives and orders were given to every law enforcement and special service. As you know, people have been convicted and incarcerated for the crimes they have committed. Some say they are contractors, not the employers– the latter got left out of the equation, went into hiding or were given shelter, but investigative bodies have no knowledge of this. They have made every effort to expose the perpetrators of these crimes, and some of them died while being apprehended. I think you are aware of this. And in general, I think that this score-settling is not just unacceptable, it does nothing but harm our country. So, I am absolutely sure that, even if there were some political motives, that can also be accommodated in the minds of those who do not understand what they are doing. But they must understand that the state will fight this kind of crime. We will continue doing everything within our power. If it was really ordered by someone that we do not know about, we will look for them. This is my first point. Now, the first part of your question, the future of Donbass. The future of Donbass must be determined by the people who live in Donbass. There is no other way. We see ourselves as mediators for creating the best conditions in which the local population can determine its own future. Are there problems? Yes, because, according to the Minsk agreements, Russia is to act as a mediator but somebody else wants to make us a party to this conflict. There is no such provision in the Minsk agreements and it is not something we agreed to. Speaking about those who may be spitting at the screen while watching this or any other event, there will always be people to spit at the screen, whether it is showing today's event or what is happening in Ukraine: horrible poverty and the prospect of a harsh winter. When Verkhovna Rada deputies visit regions, they meet pensioners who ask them:""Why are you killing us?"" Of course, they spit at the TV when they hear the bragging of the current Kiev regime. No matter the cause, there will always be people who spit, on both sides. How can someone issue orders to shoot? You should ask the political leaders of Ukraine how they bring themselves to issue orders to fire on Donbass every single day. You know, some time ago we reached agreement that only senior officials, all the way up to the relevant ministries, are allowed to issue orders to retaliate if either party fires. In one case it is Donetsk and Lugansk, and in another it is Kiev. Why that decision? To make sure that attacks cease. The Kiev officials later back-pedalled and authorised field commanders to issue this kind of order. The shooting resumed. Ask them why they did that and how they brought themselves to issue orders to shoot at their own citizens since they consider Donbass residents Ukrainian citizens? Their own citizens. Not some other country. As for the future, the Minsk agreements state that the Ukrainian Constitution must be amended to grant these regions autonomy, to hold elections and grant amnesty. As I said, what do we see in the draft law on transition period? A military government instead of elections. Lustration instead of amnesty. Returning troops to their permanent bases instead of elections and political solutions to political issues. This is the reality. What does it mean, returning troops to their permanent bases? It means sending troops to the territory without any political process or elections. Look, as I have already said, there is a requirement in the Minsk Agreements to amend the Constitution. Where are these amendments? It is written there that these amendments must be coordinated with the representatives of the LPR and the DPR. They must be coordinated. I remember this perfectly well because I took part in drafting these solutions. Far from coordinating anything or making any proposals on amending the Constitution, they are refusing pointblank even to talk with Donbass representatives, although when these agreements were signed in Minsk, they insisted that Donbass representatives sign this document. And they did. Frankly, they were refusing to sign it. We had to talk to them to persuade them to do it. They did but now nobody is even talking to them. They are called terrorists and any possibility of talking with them is rejected. Can you explain why? Because instead of responding to the call for peace in Ukrainian society, which Zelensky exploited to come to power, he chose not to keep his promises, having fallen, like previous leaders, under the influence of radical elements that are called""natsi' in Ukraine. What is the problem for us? I think I have said about Donbass. We want to build friendly relations with Ukraine, moreover, we want to achieve this at any cost and will go to practically any lengths. But how is it possible to develop relations with the current leaders, considering what they are doing? It is practically impossible. However, we are ready to work with those who would like to develop relations with Russia in the spirit of friendship. What is happening with these forces? Extrajudicial executions, sanctions against Ukrainian nationals in violation of Ukrainian law and Constitution, or simply killings in the street. Nobody is looking for the murderers. You just asked me about murders that sadly took place in our country. You asked, where are those who ordered the contract killing? People are in prison. Whether they ordered it or not, they are in prison in any event. And what happens there? If a murder takes place in the street, nobody searches for the culprit at all. People were burned alive in the Trade Union House in Odessa– has anyone lifted a finger to find the criminals? Not in the least. In other words, we do not have any chance of working with those people who want to move relations forward. The people who want to work with us are being destroyed– this is the gist of the problem. Now about my agreements with President Biden. Yes, I have already said that he suggested appointing official representatives for discussing strategic stability issues including our concerns over the growing threat from Ukraine. He made an offer, we countered, and I think it was a very constructive and quick deal. Incidentally, I told him during our conversation: I promise you that we will send you our proposals in the near future. And we did this, we sent them to both the United States and NATO. We are ready to discuss them at the OSCE platform as well. I hope this first positive reaction and the announcement that work will begin shortly, in the first days of January, will allow us to move forward. Dmitry Peskov: Moving on to the central section… Vladimir Putin: Can you put it there? Lift it:""Tatars,"" right? Go ahead, please. Kirill Shlykov: Good afternoon, Mr President! Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon. Kirill Shlykov: Kirill Shlykov, KazanFirst internet publication, city of Kazan, Republic of Tatarstan. Like many other regions of Russia, Tatarstan has a programme to allocate plots of lands for families with many children– I am sure you know about it. The programme is working, plots are allotted, and everything is going well with this. But now it is necessary to develop these areas. They need hospitals, kindergartens, schools and roads. Families with many children are eager to have a separate federal programme that would provide for the development of these areas because, unfortunately, the regions do not have enough funds for developing these""villages with many children."" Maybe, it is worth drafting a separate federal programme, a subprogramme under a national project? Is it possible to do this? What do you as President, as the head of state, plan to do for developing the programme on allocating plots to families with many children and providing facilities for these areas? Thank you very much. Vladimir Putin: You raised a very important question, Kirill. I said in the very beginning that we allocate huge funds for developing infrastructure. It is simply necessary to include these requirements in the projects you have just mentioned and in the infrastructure development projects for the surrounding areas. I made a note for myself and I will certainly set this task for the Government and the regions, so that the regions submit their applications for the development of the regional road network among other things. For the time being, the level of the regional road network is below that of the federal network. I am referring to its compliance with standards. But we have plans, for every year, on how we should bring these roads in line with standards. All this is supported by funding, and it is only necessary to tie in the problem you mentioned with our development plans. I will certainly raise this issue before the Government. Thank you for telling me about this. You are absolutely right. Kirill Shlykov: Yes, thank you, Mr President because society… Colleagues, just a minute. I wanted to add that the army of families with many children is a big part of society. Vladimir Putin: I understand. Kirill Shlykov: We tell our audience about them and write about them all the time. They are raising these problems. They say practically every day that the state is giving them plots but, unfortunately, without developing the surrounding area. Vladimir Putin: Yes, I understand. These 500 billion that have now been allocated for developing infrastructure, plus another 460 billion under national projects and plus the money from the National Welfare Fund must not be just spent but used for comprehensive solutions, including support for families with many children. I made a note for myself. This is absolutely correct. I fully agree with you. Kirill Shlykov: Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Can you move further up? Some of our colleagues are sitting far up, I cannot even see them. Dmitry Peskov: Let us go to the back row. Volgograd is here, correct? Raise it higher, it is a dark red sign. Go ahead. Anna Korokhova: Good afternoon, Mr President, My name is Anna Korokhova, Volgograd municipal television. Our hero city is a major centre for patriotic education. You have repeatedly focused on the significance of the Battle of Stalingrad, the need to preserve historical memory, and the exploits of our ancestors during the Great Patriotic War. Preservation of memorials is an important part of this work. The Motherland is Calling sculpture on Mamayev Kurgan had been renovated in time for the 75th anniversary of Victory. However, many sites at Mamayev Kurgan need attention badly, including the Battle of Stalingrad Museum-Reserve and its sites. Is it possible, in the lead up to the 80th anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War, to receive federal support in order to renovate these sites? One more question, if I may. It is really important. It is about an exoskeleton. The Volgograd researchers have developed Ekzar-34– an exoskeleton that helps with rehabilitation of patients with severe musculoskeletal disorders. I will give you an example. Alexandra Agafonova, a person with a Group I disability, was struggling with congenital arthrogryposis for a very long time. She was even unable to hold a spoon. She is now a four-time Paralympic Swimming World Champion. People came to us for rehabilitation from other Russian regions and foreign countries. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to organise this work locally. We would like to ask you to help us create the first all-Russian centre for building endoprostheses in the Volgograd Region. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Let us start with your last question. Of course, we need to give it some thought. After all, we have programmes that provide people with disabilities with the necessary technical devices, and money is allocated to this end. Of course, the most effective, modern and expensive equipment must be purchased, and it is being purchased also from abroad. I am absolutely sure that the people you mentioned and their invention, of course, are priced several times lower than the equipment that is purchased abroad. If it is as effective as you are saying, I will definitely let the Government know about this and we will see where it goes from there. First, we will see how to support them additionally and review the possibility of creating this centre. I am sure you understand that I cannot say right off the bat whether we need this centre or not. They do already have something that allows them to work, they have already done it. If it is so effective, support can be provided in different ways and in different areas, including by providing support to small and medium-sized businesses, under social policy projects and through supporting people with disabilities. Different tools can be used here. I will issue an instruction to think about which of these tools can be used in order to support them. This covers your first question. Second, federal support for cultural sites. Of course, in the run-up to important dates such as this, even more so in Volgograd, we should focus on the monuments that you mentioned. I made a note for myself. We are providing this kind of support, I have no doubt that it is being provided in Volgograd as well, but I will double check it. If this is not enough and if something extra needs to be done in time for these significant dates, we will, of course, do it. Dmitry Peskov: I saw Mari El. Anastasia Petrova: Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr President, colleagues. My name is Anastasia Petrova and I represent the Republic of Mari El, the Mariyskaya Pravda(Mari Truth) newspaper. Mr President, you suggested declaring 2022 the Year of Folk Art and Non-Material National Heritage. The Republic of Mari El is a multinational region where many talented people, like in many other regions of the Federation, are developing our culture. Our newspaper, Mariyskaya Pravda, regularly writes about them. By the way, it is among Russia's top ten newspapers this year. Here is my question. Mr President, do you think it is worth drafting and adopting some support measures in the law on folk crafts so that the development of folk art is supported on a regular, permanent basis? And one more thing. I hope the administration and my editor-in-chief forgive me, but for the first time in 20 years I am asking you a question and am very happy about it. I will allow myself a small personal request. Mr President, you know that the train from Yoshkar-Ola goes only to Moscow. I took the train yesterday at 7.26 pm, which is the only one, to come to the news conference today. It would be great if we could travel from Yoshkar-Ola to Nizhny Novgorod, Samara or Vladimir. You know, I went to Nizhny Novgorod in May. I do not have a car so I ordered BlaBlaCar and received fake links asking me to transfer the money. I am from the younger generation and I understand that customers of this service can be scammed. Unfortunately, older people who would like to go to Nizhny Novgorod or Vladimir from Yoshkar-Ola may get scammed into sending money. Maybe it is worth expanding the railway to make it possible to go from Yoshkar-Ola not only to Moscow but also to Nizhny Novgorod and Vladimir, as I have already said. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Anastasia, I will surely talk today or tomorrow to Mr Belozerov, the head of Russian Railways, and he will definitely be instructed to look into the connectivity of these neighbouring areas. Naturally, every company including Russian Railways works in market conditions, always looking at the economic component: will there be enough passengers. But I agree with you that if nothing is done, nothing will change, so let them try it. I am sure he will hear me, it is not even necessary to call him but I will call him nonetheless and talk with him. We will see what can be done. I hope that it will be possible to do something about this. Given the vast expanses of our country, the issue of connectivity is very important for Russia for both economic and individual reasons. Now about folk crafts. I think we have still made a number of decisions recently concerning training for those who are involved in folk crafts and want to continue working in that field. That said, I have to agree that we have not done enough. After all, Mari El and other adjacent republics are unique in their own way. I remember my visit there. I looked at how people lived there, using all they inherited from previous generations, and how careful they were with all of it. Of course, it always evokes a desire to support all this. You know, I made a note for myself and we will try to do what can be done additionally. Thank you for raising this issue. This is very important for our diverse multi-ethnic country. It is extremely important to support the languages and cultures, the authentic cultures of the peoples of Russia. Dmitry Peskov: We should not forget those who do not have signs. Please, young man, go ahead but, first, introduce yourself. Artem Vilovatykh: Hello, Mr President. Artem Vilovatykh, Krasny Sever newspaper, Vologda Region. I have the following question: you know that the Vologda Region is the homeland of Father Frost. Of course, you have been to Veliky Ustyug. Yesterday, a resident of St Petersburg sued our Father Frost for failing to grant his wishes over the previous 23 years. Mr President, what do you think about how some of our compatriots recently seem willing to use any topic to gain public attention, or, as they say now, hype themselves. This is my first question. Accordingly, my next question is about your relationship with Father Frost. Does he grant your wishes? Do you have New Year wishes this year? We are going to celebrate the New Year before long, so it is time for a funny and light-hearted question. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Is this an adult person? Artem Vilovatykh: He is a lawyer from St Petersburg. If he says Father Frost has failed to grant his wishes for 23 years, he must be quite grown up. Vladimir Putin: He is a lawyer from St Petersburg, an adult. I am also a lawyer from St Petersburg– there are some similarities. What can I say about this? Here is how I would answer: since I am also a lawyer, I can act as Father Frost's legal counsel and remind the plaintiff that Father Frost only grants wishes of and gives presents to good girls and boys. He should take a look at his behaviour and he might find out what is keeping Father Frost from lavishing New Year gifts on him. That would be the main line of defence. As for hype, what is most important is that it is not for wicked reasons. As long as there is a dash or element of good humour, there is nothing bad about it. Artem Vilovatykh: Still, what about your relationship with Father Frost? Does he grant your wishes? Vladimir Putin: So far, we have maintained cordial relations and I am grateful to him for the opportunity to meet with you today in my current role. I am even more grateful to the people of the Russian Federation for entrusting me with this high office. Hopefully, Father Frost will not only give presents to each of us but, most importantly, make sure that the plans of the whole country and every citizen of the Russian Federation are realised. Artem Vilovatykh: Thank you. Dmitry Peskov: Rossiya 24. Vladimir Putin: Excuse me, Mr Peskov, it is clear that Rossiya 24 is always on duty, but I see a girl holding a poster saying""Relocation."" It is always a painful issue. Darya Shuchalina: Good afternoon, Mr President, colleagues. I am Darya Shuchalina from Syktyvkar, the Republic of Komi. I represent the newspaper Panorama Stolitsy. I have been a social activist for 11 years. I am head of the Housing and Utilities Control centre in Komi too, and I am also a journalist. One of the issues people bring to me has to do with relocation from dilapidated housing. I would like to use this occasion to express gratitude to you, because our country has accumulated unique experience of using budgetary funds to finance this method of settling our people's housing problems. Vladimir Putin: I think no other country is doing this. Darya Shuchalina: Yes, this is true. A second nationwide programme is underway now for all regions. First of all, I have a proposal for you. Mr President, we are asking you to consider the possibility of extending this programme. The current programme was launched in 2019 for five years. If possible, we suggest that its funding should not be reduced, because more houses are being identified as dangerous every year simultaneously with the relocation of people from dilapidated buildings. In other words, our housing stock is becoming dilapidated even despite major repairs. This is our proposal. As for the question, I would like to ask your opinion of relocation conditions set by the federal centre for the regions. Do you think they are achieving the desired result? Will you tighten or simplify them? We would like to ask you to pay special attention to relations between relocated people and banks, because many people took out mortgages to buy flats in the houses that have been declared substandard, and it is not always possible for them to coordinate reduced lease payments with the banks or to find some other solution. Vladimir Putin: Just a minute, what do mortgages have to do with this? What is the connection between relocation from dilapidated houses and mortgages? Darya Shuchalina: Many people bought their housing with mortgage financing several years ago, and it has recently been declared substandard. This means that until the next programme is adopted, if it is adopted, they will have to continue making mortgage payments while living in dilapidated housing. They do not understand what to do with their flats, which cannot be sold, because they have to wait until the next relocation programme, and in the meantime, they will have to pay off their mortgages to the banks. Very many people are concerned about this detail. A large-scale inspection of housing was held this year, because our municipal authorities have been inspired by the first two programmes. This took place not only in the Republic of Komi. I have talked with my colleagues in other regions, who said that all municipal authorities inspected their housing stock to identify substandard houses, mostly wooden ones. But they will not be included in the current programme, which only covers houses that were declared dilapidated prior to January 1, 2017. Therefore, we are pinning our hopes on a new programme, which would include the houses that have been declared substandard this year. At the same time, we need to settle the problem of people with mortgage flats, which are their only housing. Vladimir Putin: Indeed, our first programme focused on the housing that was recognised substandard until a particular time period, and then recognised as substandard prior to January 1, 2017. I have mentioned this many times before and I will say it again: we must get people out of this situation and out of the slums they are living in now. Flats or houses that had been bought with a mortgage and were later recognised as dilapidated housing are a special case. This is about bad construction quality. We need to decide what to do with the builders, the construction oversight authorities, and so on. But, of course, we need to help people as well. In this regard, the first question is about joint participation in this work and co-financing by the regions. I understand that the regions prefer to minimise their share of participation, this is understandable, and to have the federal budget assume the bulk of expenses. We need to look at this depending on the region and the financial circumstances of a particular region. In the grand scheme of things, people do not care much about relations between the Finance Ministry and the corresponding regional financial body. They need to have the problem solved. The state power, if it claims to be called such, must, first of all, be guided by this super goal which is to meet the people's interests. Of course, we will be setting this mechanism up, bearing in mind that the regions' financial capabilities are growing, and the regional budgets' revenues are up significantly. The Finance Ministry has these numbers. So, our efforts will be grounded in the actual state of affairs. Anyway, I will bring this to their attention. We are dealing with it all the time, believe me, we are watching it all the time and discuss it in the Government. Your question is a reason to revisit this issue. We will definitely discuss this issue and give it a thought. It is necessary, of course, to look into the situation where people live in hazardous flats they have bought with a mortgage. I do not have an answer to that right now, but we will look for one. If this problem exists, we will look for an answer. Frankly, this is the first time I have heard this. I have always thought that dilapidated housing is about buildings dating back many years, to the 1950s, which are crumbling and people need to be relocated from these slums as soon as possible. However, if the problem exists, we will look into it. The most important part of your question is whether these programmes will continue, that is, will housing be recognised as substandard after January 1, 2017, and will the appropriate fund be allocated? The answer is yes. A programme to this end is being drafted. Dmitry Peskov: Mr President, Rossiya 24. Vladimir Putin: Let us take Spas TV first. Sorry, Rossiya 24 will go next. All right? Dmitry Peskov: Rossiya 24 will go next. Veronika Ivashchenko: Good afternoon. My name is Veronika Ivashchenko, Spas TV channel. Here is my question. Mr President, you started talking about demographics today, specifically, about large families. The question is, we all know that demographics are the biggest unsolved problem with Russians. Why? Because at this point Russia no longer wants to have children. Living standards are going up, everything is fine, things are good outwardly, but for some reason, people decide against having children, and if we look at divorce statistics, we can see they have also forgotten how to build relationships. What do you think the reasons are? These ailments, one might say, are not of economic, but of spiritual nature. This is something we used to be proud of, my great-grandparents had seven to ten children, I mean, in my family, we have always had many children and we have always respected the traditions of a strong family. What measures could be taken, apart from economic ones, such as the maternity capital and other benefits– what measures do you think could help change this situation? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: You mentioned the Russian tradition of having large families. I can tell you that both my parents also come from large families, and their parents' families had many children, nine to ten, both boys and girls. Incidentally, almost all of them– not all, but nearly all– perished during the Great Patriotic War. That was a huge tragedy and a crushing blow to our demographics. As a reminder, Russia suffered one demographic gap in 1943–1944 and another in 1991, after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Why? Because the planning horizon narrowed dramatically, and oddly enough, in 1991, after the collapse of the USSR, people apparently had the same sentiment as during the Great Patriotic War. The family planning horizon narrowed to a few days, and this is what happened. As for Russia no longer wanting to have children or not knowing how, we recorded far more births in 2004 and 2006 than in 1991, and later too, the birth rate began to grow. And, prosaic as this might sound, that had to do with an improvement of the economic situation and the expansion of the planning horizon. Getting children on their feet is no easy business and quite a challenge from a financial standpoint. It is for this reason that in everything we do, including during the pandemic, we seek to support families with children. I already mentioned this at the beginning, and I would like to say it one more time. I will not repeat everything, because there is even more to it: our objective is to develop an entire motherhood and childhood support framework for accompanying children from the moment they are born right until they graduate from school. This must be done soon, next year and the following years. We will enact the relevant support measures at every stage. They already exist, but there are certain age gaps. We will bridge them within the next 18 months. I do hope that this will play a positive role in terms of improving the demographic situation. Of course, there are also delicate issues that lie far below the surface and are hard to understand at first sight. In fact, all post-industrial nations face the same demographic problem. Just look at Europe: it is the same everywhere. What is causing this? It is not that people are not interested, but they, including women of childbearing age, have other priorities: education, post-graduate education, careers, and only then kids, but by then they are already 30 years old. There is hardly any time left for the second child. This is a general trend, and quite a delicate issue. Demographers study this professionally and have been working on this subject their entire lives, but even they lack definitive and clear answers to these questions. This is how things stand, more or less. As for the spiritual side of the question, you are right of course that careers and wellbeing are important, but we need to drive home the message that the happiness and the joy of fatherhood and motherhood are more important than the financial wellbeing you may enjoy today. We need to impress this on the people gradually and calmly, without imposing anything on anyone. Let me reiterate that we must refrain from imposing anything on anyone, but we still need to give positive publicity to the idea of a large, friendly, good-spirited, and beautiful family, and show that happiness is about having children, in order to convince people that there is nothing in the world or in life that can bring more happiness. However, this requires a creative, talented approach that must also be eye-catching and sophisticated. This effort must include the mass media, artists and NGOs. We need to offer financial support to people who decide to have children. Let us all come together and move in this direction. There is a young lady raising a poster with the word""Pain"" on it. What happened? Asya Gukasyan: Good afternoon, Asya Gukasyan. Tivikom TV and Radio. Republic of Buryatia. There is a very urgent issue in our region. Our infectious disease hospital is in a very bad shape. It is 80 years old and has undergone major repairs only once. It has only about 200 beds and now during the pandemic the problems have become even more pressing. This is why we decided to ask you for help. We need a new building. Both the Republic and municipal authorities are working on this problem and have already found a site for a new building but, unfortunately, construction is very expensive. Our Republic's budget does not have such funds for this. Vladimir Putin: This is Buryatia? Asya Gukasyan: Yes, Buryatia. Vladimir Putin: The money is, of course, there but it is always tempting to save it. Well, your bosses did the right thing by prompting you to ask this question. I promise you that I will certainly look into what can be done to resolve this issue. It is a very pressing one and is connected not just with the current pandemic but with potential future events. In previous years, when everything was fine, we withdrew some funding from this sector of healthcare and many things were ruined. But I will certainly look into it and try to respond. Thank you very much. Asya Gukasyan: May I ask you one question? We had a big utility accident in Ulan-Ude, the capital of Buryatia, recently. You probably heard about it– a fire at a heat and power station. I can give the floor to my colleague with your permission. She would like to talk about this problem. Vladimir Putin: In other words, you want to replace Mr Peskov? All right, go ahead, be the press secretary. Bayarma Radnayeva: Sain baina, Mr President, Sain baina, colleagues. Hello! Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon! Bayarma Radnayeva: My name is Bayarma Radnayeva, Buryad TV. The problem is that we had a utility accident in Ulan-Ude at 3 am. There was a fire at a heat and power station and almost half the city's population was left without hot water and heating. Now we are counting the losses. But we already know that major repairs are ahead, and it is likely that there will not be enough funds for that. The administration of our region is asking for help in resolving this problem. And I have one more question. There was a recent discussion about Baikal becoming a special federal territory. We already have an example of the Tunka National Park where local residents have constant problems with legalizing their land and other issues with life-sustaining activities. Is there any news on the fate of Baikal? Will it become a federal territory? Will Baikal'move' further away from the residents of Buryatia in this sense? Thank you very much. Vladimir Putin: As for the heat and power station, we will look into what is going on there. I promise you we will close this issue right now. After the news conference, I will find out what is happening there and what assistance is required. This is the first point. As for Baikal, I have not even heard of it becoming a federal territory or that this is being discussed. I would like to emphasise that in any case it will not be less accessible to the people. If somebody has raised this idea(frankly, I am hearing about it for the first time) they are certainly referring to the allocation of additional funding, or a way to allocate funds to preserve Lake Baikal's unique ecosystem. That's it. The goal is to develop economic activity without interfering with anyone's life and help people organise their life and work there. I would like to emphasise that if those who live near Baikal have any doubts they should forget about them. They should have no apprehensions. There is only one reason to raise this issue– to help preserve the unique ecosystem of Lake Baikal and to assist the people who live there. Let's go to the back rows again. Mr Peskov, can you see anyone there? Dmitry Peskov: I can. Raise the blue poster higher. Go ahead. Indira Asanova: Good afternoon, Mr President, colleagues. Indira Begaydar, Kazakhstan TV channel. Mr President, which items on the regional and international agendas will Russia prioritise in the near future in its dialogue with Kazakhstan? As far as we know, this year you planned a visit to Kazakhstan, which did not take place due to the unfavourable epidemiological situation. Are you planning to visit our country next year? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Here is what I would like to say. Kazakhstan is one of our closest allies. We have a unique relationship with Kazakhstan which was laid down by its First President Nursultan Nazarbayev, and the new President[Kassym-Jomart Tokayev], with whom I have very close and friendly relations, picked up these policies and maintains the quality of our relations. Indeed, the pandemic prevented Kazakhstan from carrying out the planned activities, but I hope that the President of Kazakhstan and the First President of Kazakhstan will accept my invitation and come to St Petersburg next week for the traditional, informal meeting of the EAEU and CSTO member states. I am very much counting on this, and the leadership of Kazakhstan has preliminarily accepted the invitation. Our cooperation focuses, primarily, on the economy. Relations with Kazakhstan in the economic sphere cover a variety of areas but changing the structure of our economic ties and focusing on high-tech areas are among our key goals. This includes, above all, digitalisation, and other important areas such as genetics and medicine, as well as joint space exploration since we continue and will continue to work together at Baikonur. There are many areas of focus between us. Nevertheless, I agree with the way our Kazakhstani friends framed the question, namely that if we work together, Kazakhstan should be more than a platform for launching spacecraft, it should be involved in broader and more meaningful space exploration and develop its own competencies in this area. I share this approach, and we are now exploring options. I am confident that we will get to implementing these plans. We have deep ties in culture and education. I am grateful to the leadership of Kazakhstan for their efforts to support and develop Russian language studies. You are aware that many people in Kazakhstan are studying Russian. This is a Russian-speaking country in the full sense of the word. The number of schools where children studying the Russian language and university branches that teach Russian, is on the rise, and the number of applicants applying for admission to these education institutions is quite high. We cooperate with Kazakhstan as an active member of the CSTO as well. Notably, military equipment and materiel are supplied to Kazakhstan mostly at domestic Russian prices. And, the First President of Kazakhstan was the one to initiate the creation of the Eurasian Economic Union. So, I very much hope that the pace we have gained and the quality of our work will be maintained. Dmitry Peskov: If Buryatia gave me back my responsibilities for a short while… Vladimir Putin: That's not me, it is Buryatia that his given them back to you. You should thank them for it. Dmitry Peskov: Thank you, Buryatia. Now we have Rossiya 24. Vladimir Putin: Rossiya 24, of course. Anastasia Yefimova: Rossiya 24 is here. Good afternoon, Mr President. My question concerns the situation with RUSNANO. According to some experts, it is unfolding under a negative scenario, let me quote,""Little information, a lot of debt."" In fact, the company itself considers the debts to be exorbitant and talks about restructuring them. Meanwhile, Fitch believes that the developments around RUSNANO is a kind of a test for the government referring to the loans issued to the company with state guarantees. Consequently, the state now must act on them. But will it back up such high-risk investments? What would your answer to this question be? In other words, will the state somehow settle RUSNANO's debts and, overall, what do you think about the company's prospects? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: This is indeed a challenge. I will not quote the figures now– some say the debt amounts to 140 billion, others say 102 billion. These problems are assessed differently in terms of value by the Government and the company itself. You know that the company's new leadership has set to work. They have a free hand in conducting an objective evaluation and engaging the best experts to assess the real situation in the company. There is indeed a fairly big volume of guarantees provided by the Government of the Russian Federation for their projects. I have to say that RUSNANO is actually a venture company. I will not hide that I was among the proponents of establishing this company. Back in the day I also pushed the Government and its finance and economy block towards funding the creation of our constellation of satellites and the GLONASS constellation. Otherwise, we would have been in zugzwang, like when satellites were being decommissioned after a protracted operation on the orbit due to their technical capabilities, and with the existing funding volumes we would never have created a fully operational constellation that would have allowed us to resolve the issues facing GLONASS. However, we did it. Our GLONASS appeared straight after GPS, before our Chinese friends launched BeiDou. And the company is operating and developing, albeit not without problems. The same is true of RUSNANO. Obviously, they were largely blazing a trail. Clearly, some of the projects were fulfilled successfully whereas some of them, regretfully, could not be finished. Those are risky investments. This is why the state decided to provide its guarantees to ensure this work. But we have to look into the real state of affairs. The company, not the government, should work with its creditors, with the banks. Sberbank, for instance, got rid of most loans; it sold them away. Sberbank's top management probably had some insider information but they did it somehow. The state guarantees, nevertheless, exist, and they must be enforced which does not mean the company should not work with banks or work to enhance and improve its economic performance. By the way, as far as I know, the company recently satisfied some of its obligations, its securities, with its own funds. It means that overall the company is viable. It is just a process that should continue steadily in view of the economic situation and the projects and programmes which must certainly bring a profit because the company must operate in the market. We will definitely support the process. Dmitry Peskov: We have so many regions represented here… Vladimir Putin: There was a sign that said""Coal"" over there. Can we? It is important. Go ahead, please. Alexandra Cherdantseva: Good afternoon, Mr President. Thank you for the opportunity to ask a question. My name is Alexandra Cherdantseva, PolitSibRu news agency, Barnaul, Altai Territory. I will not speak at length about the issue of coal, as you are perfectly aware of it. The Altai Territory, along with probably many other regions, faced problems when municipal authorities were unable to start the heating season on schedule, some due to fuel shortages, while others due to fuel price hikes. The municipal authorities have somehow overlooked this issue. My question is not about assigning guilt; the question is what is to be done. What can federal authorities do to help the regions live under these new conditions, with new coal prices? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: I would very much like to hear from you more details about what is happening and where. Why? Because both regional and federal authorities reported to me recently that everyone is completely ready for the heating season. Where did the failures occur, can you name the places? Alexandra Cherdantseva: No, at present everyone is ready, the heating season is in progress. There was a period when municipalities claimed it was too expensive to buy coal. The heating season is under way, everything looks fine, but the prices remain high and the municipalities will have to find that money somewhere. Vladimir Putin: Naturally. You see, we have subsidies for that. By the way, you know, I will approach this issue from another angle. It was no accident that we introduced an amendment to the Constitution that all levels of public authority are a single system. And if municipalities lack something, it does not relieve the region's authorities from responsibility; they must respond adequately. Regardless of the price hikes, the required volumes should have been provided for so as to start the heating season on schedule and go through its autumn-winter maximum. Coal prices went up– that is all well and good, but purchase volumes and work with companies should have been addressed in proper time. I assure you that the companies which make good profits from exports and pay good wages to their workers, would certainly have arranged a proper pricing policy for the regions where their workers actually reside, provided they had been asked about it. So this is just an oversight– both by the municipalities and the region. You do not want to name the exact municipalities. I do not mean to force you but will you please write to me, and I will figure out what happened there. Alexandra Cherdantseva: At the regional level coal reserves are quite good, but the population faced this problem. Vladimir Putin: That's what I am asking– where exactly, which municipality? Alexandra Cherdantseva: There were many complaints from Loktevksy District. People say buying coal is too costly and they just cannot afford it. Vladimir Putin: There is a simple way out– subsidies. We provide subsidies including for the autumn-winter season. This should just be addressed in due time, that is all there is to it. There is nothing unusual or difficult about it. Let me reiterate: in the run-up to the heating season all the regional and federal authorities reported that the country is ready for the start of the heating season. Apparently, some failures are possible. I shall check how things are in different places. Agreed. Alexandra Cherdantseva: Thank you. Dmitry Peskov: Let's ask the only person sitting without a banner. Introduce yourself, please. Murad Gazdiev: Murad Gazdiev, RT. My question is about system-wide problems in Western society that you spoke about recently. This is cancel culture, rejection of usual concepts like""mum,""""dad,""""family"" and even""gender."" You might have heard that Joan Rowling also got her share when even Harry Porter actors ganged up on her because of her radical stance that a woman is a woman and a man is a man. What do you think of the new ethic? Will this""caravan of values"" arrive in Russia and will the state's fighting for traditional values turn into a fight against youth subcultures and organisations, the way it was in the USSR? Vladimir Putin: First, it is inevitable that the""caravan"" will travel. It is inevitable in the contemporary world with the internet and modern communications. It is very much like the coronavirus pandemic. New strains keep popping up, and we can't get away from it. What we need is to look for a proper antidote. If someone thinks that a man and a woman is the same, let it be. However, there is still some common sense in the world. I may be wrong although it is unlikely, Ms Sobchak asked a question about penitentiaries, I think in the US– and if I am wrong do not be annoyed with me,– a prisoner convicted of rape declared himself a woman and demanded that he be transferred to a women's prison. So they did. And he promptly raped his female cellmate. But there should be some semblance of common sense in everything. Or take athletes. A man declares himself a woman and competes, say, in weightlifting or some other sport. Women's sport will cease to exist completely. There must be some common sense. I uphold the traditional approach that a woman is a woman, a man is a man, a mother is a mother, and a father is a father. I hope that our society has an inner moral protection dictated by the traditional faiths of the Russian Federation. The strength and power of our thousand-year-old society lie in the fact that Russia was formed as a multi-ethnic and multi-faith state, and we have learnt to treat each other with respect. With respect. What does that mean? It means that we respect the foundations of our traditional spiritual culture. All the peoples of the Russian Federation– I want to stress""all""– have a certain inner moral protection against the obscurantism you mentioned. Let them do whatever they want over there. We must take the most progressive and the best which helps us develop, move on, be leaders in technology, in the economy, humanitarian areas– I mean healthcare or, say, education. But I hope that our peoples, Russia's ethnicities have enough deep immunity and protection systems against this obscurantism, as I said. And it should be countered not by direct instructions, slapdowns or accusations but rather by upholding our traditional values, which I always keep saying. Dmitry Peskov: Let us move over here to make sure we do not leave the federal media out. Please give a microphone to Life. Alexander Yunashev: Good afternoon, Mr President, Alexander Yunashev, Life. Let me follow up on the domestic agenda. Early on, you said that the Government is working satisfactorily. I would like to go person by person. Who among the ministers is your favourite, who got a bonus from you already? I wonder how much. Who got the most from you, and who did you give a dressing down to behind closed doors? We all saw you and Shoigu taking a break in the taiga. Why do you not take Mishustin with you? Why is that? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: If we take Mishustin along… Remember the old Jewish joke:""Who will stay in the shop?"" Who will work? So, once in a while Mr Mishustin goes on holiday as well. To everyone's knowledge or not, each of us… In any case, the Prime Minister, who is vastly responsible for the situation in the country, calls me and tells me– as is customary– where he is going… He is always in touch. As for the trips to Siberia, I have been doing this since the early 2000s. For me, this is a part of my life. I was asked about where I would like to live: St Petersburg or Moscow? I really like Siberia as well, with its unique ecosystem and unique people. Really. You know, Siberians with their values ​​and moral qualities are Russia's gold fund. There are all sorts of people, but I am saying this in general. As for who I criticise and who is a favourite… You see, I cannot have any favourites, and I never had any. I have been working with many people for many years and I know them well. But if I see that someone is either underperforming, or is trying to cut corners, I always point this out to my colleagues regardless of our personal relationship and push for a proper approach towards the issues that we are working on or discussing. As for the bonuses, yes, I think that based on the results of the efforts to overcome the pandemic, some members of the Executive Office and the Government deserve a bonus. But here, I believe, the approach should not be differentiated, and we should rather assess the work of the Government overall. So, singling out people or giving big bonuses to some and punishing other people by paying them the proverbial five kopecks… I think that since this is a bonus, you need to evaluate the team work rather than the work of each individual, although this needs to be done, and, believe me, I do it. However, as you understand, saying that this person is good and that one is bad is impossible and wrong, because it is not about who is good and who is bad, it is about how we manage this process and whether we succeed in making sure that everyone works effectively. And if we do not, including myself, it means that we are not doing enough. Dmitry Peskov: Let us continue with a dash of foreign media. I see Rai, our colleagues from Italy. Please go ahead. Sergio Paini: Thank you. Sergio Paini, Rai, Italian television. Good afternoon, Mr President. How much change has the Russia-Italy relationship undergone with Prime Minister Mario Draghi in office? Do you think Italy can act as a mediator in Russia's relations with the European Union? Vladimir Putin: As far as I can tell, if not exemplary, Italy-Russia relations are good and stable, and transcend partisanship. Regardless of the forces that are currently at the helm in Italy, the Italian Republic and its Government, we are following in the tracks of what was laid down by Mr Berlusconi, who initiated stronger relations between Russia and NATO, among other things. He came up with a number of long-term projects, including, by the way, in the sphere of small and medium-sized businesses. All of that continues regardless of the political forces that, at any given point, find themselves at the top of political power. I believe that this supra-partisan nationwide consensus is key in Italy-Russia relations. Of course, Italy is a NATO country and an EU member, but this does not keep us from working in the way I just mentioned. I hope that it will remain like that as we go forward. Mr Draghi and I have spoken on the telephone several times. We communicate in a very friendly and meaningful manner on a number of issues that are of interest to the Italian Republic in terms of expanding our economic ties. Bearing in mind our good and friendly relations, Italy could play its role in normalising Russia-EU relations even as part of the Russia-NATO talks that are being planned. Dmitry Peskov: Thank you. I see a small poster with the letters SMA. It means spinal muscular atrophy, right? Vladimir Putin: Mr Peskov, I saw someone holding a heart. Maybe they will say something nice? Dmitry Peskov: We will get back to you. Thank you. Please raise the heart up. Vladimir Putin: Please, you have the floor. Gulnuz Khaibullina: Mr President, I came from the Republic of Bashkortostan. My name is Gulnuz Khaibullina. Mr President, we love our city, the capital of the Republic of Bashkortostan. You recently signed an executive order on holding events to mark the 450th anniversary of our city. We would like to know what support the federal centre will provide for the development of our city. Everybody knows that when celebrating a birthday, we dress up. So we want to celebrate this date on a grand scale. But I am not speaking about round dances and concerts, given the pandemic. We would like to have new social facilities, good roads and many beautiful buildings. So we want to know what support we will receive from the federal centre. As the President, what surprise will you prepare for us, and will you come visit? Vladimir Putin: Thank you so much for the invitation. I will try to come. Ufa is a wonderful place, one of the best cities in the Volga region. Ufa has been one of the centres of the Islamic world in Russia. As for anniversaries, it was no accident that my colleagues and I developed the relevant document. During the preparations, we will set the priorities together with the leadership of the republic. I would like to get back to what your colleague said, the issue related to large families. We do not need to allocate additional resources here; we need to use those resources that have been set aside for the development of infrastructure, roads, the social sphere and culture. They need to be distributed properly, or even redistributed, to a certain extent, so that Ufa can prepare for the anniversary the way it deserves. We could think about additional funding. We will make a decision together with our colleagues from the republic. Gulnuz Khaibullina: Zur rakhmat[thank you], Mr President. Can I suggest one more thing? How about holding the world hockey championships in Ufa? We are famous for our Salavat Yulayev club and would be happy to host such an event. Vladimir Putin: Salavat Yulayev is a great hockey team, no doubt about it, a top-notch team. As for the championships, I am not ready to answer this question yet. I believe the next world event will be held in St Petersburg, and they have been already getting the relevant facilities ready. But it is not only up to us, but the International Ice Hockey Federation. St Petersburg is quite far from Ufa. I am not sure it would be possible in terms of logistics. But Ufa can undoubtedly hold international competitions at the highest level. We will think about this suggestion. Thank you. Dmitry Peskov: Shall we give the floor to SMA? Spinal muscular atrophy is an important issue. Vladimir Putin: Yes, please. I agree. Dmitry Peskov: Introduce yourself. Albert Musin: Good afternoon. Albert Musin, Channel 4, television, Yekaterinburg. In fact, there are two issues. SMA is the second. The first one with which we originally planned to come to Moscow is about supporting the Universiade, or rather, a request to make sure that the 2023 Universiade, which is supposed to be held in Yekaterinburg, actually takes place. We even brought you a ball signed by prominent athletes from the Sverdlovsk Region, including fighters, gymnasts and racers, in a word, everyone. Regrettably, the security guards did not let it through, such are the rules. But I hope it will find its way to you. Vladimir Putin: Now that you said it, it certainly will. Albert Musin: That is exactly why I mentioned it. SMA is my second issue, because something important happened in early December. Zolgensma, the so-called golden jab that costs more than 100 million rubles, was finally registered in Russia. Here is a brief overview for our colleagues. Spinal muscular atrophy is a genetic disease that creates critical developmental disorders in children who die before they reach the age of 2 or 3 years. Now that Zolgensma has been registered, many families with children affected by SMA have a chance to receive support from the Government. However, they do not understand how it will be organised. Either it will be done through the Circle of Kindness Foundation, which was set up earlier this year and also helps raise money for children affected by SMA. So, I would like to ask you to have a clear arrangement worked out so that the parents of these children who have months, rarely years, left, know where to apply and how to get this help, and, in general, whether all these children will have the chance to get a life-saving injection. There are more than a hundred children with SMA in Russia, with 33 of them residing in our region. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: First of all, it was to help more such people, such children that the Circle of Kindness Foundation was established. You probably remember, yet I would like to remind everyone, and those who do not know should be told this, that the source of funding for this is the increased personal income tax levied on those who, let us put it this way, who earn slightly or considerably more than the country's average. The tax on their windfall profits has been increased, and we said at the very beginning that these funds would be used to support people with severe life-threatening diseases, including spinal muscular atrophy. Before that, support from budgets at different levels was only provided to 74 people across the country, but the current figure is above 100 and, as far as I know, is approaching 1,000. I am not sure about the precise figure, but this is not the point. What is important is that the number of people who receive such support has increased severalfold. The treatment is very expensive. I can tell you frankly that I discussed this matter with our colleagues only yesterday. They believe that since the very first days after the foundation's establishment– I will not go into detail now about organisational or decision-making issues, because we did not want, and I did not want this either, this project to be assigned to state agencies. We wanted it to be implemented by absolutely independent people who are respected in society. So, I was told yesterday that the project is running smoothly. Information should be available on the Public Services portal, and it can also be provided by the relevant medical staff in the regions. This is not the point. These technicalities can be easily dealt with, and I believe that you, Albert, as a person who is involved in this matter and feels for these families and these children, I believe that you and people like you can help them find their bearings in this situation. What does matter now is the age of support recipients. As of now, it is available to people aged up to 18, but we hope that the use of this treatment and other medicines that will certainly be invented in future will help to extend the life span and improve the quality of life for people with this and similar diseases. We must start thinking already about how to help people with these diseases after they turn 18, because so far, the project is only designed for people aged up to 18. But we are considering the matter, and we will certainly not forget about this problem. Alexander Fedorchak: Good afternoon, Mr President. Alexander Fedorchak, Krym 24 television channel. Thank you for the opportunity to ask a question. On behalf of our republic, I would like to thank you for the ongoing transformations. Our infrastructure has changed a lot over the past seven years, with roads, kindergartens, and so on under construction. Regrettably, however, mobile communications have remained where they were, and major Russian telecom operators have so far been unable to do business in Crimea. How can this matter be resolved at the government level? Can we expect major telecom operators to come to Crimea any time soon? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Clearly, this is because of the sanctions that our Western partners have imposed on Crimea and its residents. As I mentioned earlier, the situation is quite odd. If someone believes that Crimea is occupied, then its residents are victims of aggression. Why punish them even more then? And if they joined Russia, and returned to Russia of their own volition by way of a referendum, then it is a manifestation of democracy. Is it that someone out there is fighting democracy? No answer. There may be only one answer: they spit on the interests of the Crimeans, Russia and democracy. All they are doing is addressing their geopolitical issues. However, being aware of this, we must respond accordingly, and we will continue to do so, just as before. Perhaps, not completely, but I am sure we will resolve issues with water supply, just as we have resolved the issue of energy supply and power supply, in general, the development of infrastructure, not just the Tavrida Motorway. I asked the Government to plan for exits from this motorway to the coast, and I know they have been planned and exits to the coast will be built. We will certainly engage in expanding urban infrastructure, including in off-the-coast cities of Crimea. Just like you said, we will continue to build hospitals, kindergartens and schools, and we will renovate housing, including structurally unsafe buildings. By the way, Crimea and Sevastopol joined the programme for housing renovation and relocation from structurally deficient buildings later, so they are lagging a little behind. Crimea and Sevastopol are a little behind this programme, but we will definitely address, on a systematic basis, every problem that Crimea is facing, including relocating residents of dilapidated buildings. With regard to mobile communications, just like in other matters, we will find ways to ensure the people's interests. I will not get ahead of things and will not share our plans with you and everyone in this audience so as not to hinder the process. But we will think it over and hopefully overcome this challenge. There are also issues with individual incomes and high prices– I am aware of that– and we will gradually resolve them. Gradually, but surely. I hope that the people in Crimea and Sevastopol feel it already today and will feel it tomorrow. Dmitry Peskov: We have not had any questions on sports so far, but I do recognise Dmitry Guberniyev. Vladimir Putin: Go ahead, Dmitry. Dmitry Peskov: You have a sports-related question, right? Dmitry Guberniyev: Good afternoon. How did you guess? First, I would like to wish you all a happy New Year, and wish you good health, luck and patience, which we really need. Just remember: our athletes will defeat them all. It is so tempting for me to ask a question on biathlon, a sports discipline that unites us all. If practice is any guide, we will fight for medals in every race, including at the Olympics. My question, Mr President, is about the Olympics, where you will travel to attend the opening ceremony in Beijing. However, considering the political boycott many leaders already announced, including the President of the United States, why is this happening, in your opinion? China and people heading there to compete in a fair and clean way are being pressured. Doesn't this remind you of what was going on ahead of the Sochi Olympics? Thank you very much. Vladimir Putin: This is an unacceptable decision, a mistake. I had this conversation with one of the former Presidents of the United States– you can go ahead and guess who that was. That was quite a while ago. He told me that the boycotts of the Olympics in Los Angeles and in Moscow were big mistakes, including on behalf of the United States. The United States just keeps making the same mistake. Where does this diplomatic and political boycott of China come from? From attempts to contain the development of the People's Republic of China. There are no other reasons whatsoever. Just like art, sports must bring people together instead of causing problems in people-to-people and state-to-state relations. When sport is unable to live up to its core values, this hurts the entire international community. In fact, this shatters the last remaining scarce opportunities to restore, maintain and develop relations between nations, and this is being done for the sake of momentary political gain. This is a mistake. That said, what can we do about this? Everyone makes mistakes. However, some keep making them. There is only one reason for this, which also applies, for example, to Russia. There are no other reasons, trust me. This is not about the surname of the country's leader, or any current issues or challenges. There is only one reason for this. This is an attempt to contain development and deprive someone of the opportunity to rise above the possible competitors. I have already talked about the situation with NATO's eastward expansion. Why did they have to do this? Take, for instance, Egon Bahr. He was a politician from the Social Democratic Party of Germany and proposed building a new security architecture in Europe after the Soviet troops left Germany and Eastern Europe: keeping NATO without expanding it to Central and Eastern European countries, and creating a new system of equal security with Canada, the United States and Russia. According to the archival documents on his talks with the Soviet leaders, including Falin and others, otherwise the virtual Berlin wall will keep moving east, leaving us with the same problems. This is precisely what happened. Why? This was an attempt at containment. However, this is an erroneous policy, just like the attempt to use sports for momentary political gain. There is no way they can contain China's development. Eventually this will dawn on them. No way they can contain China. Today, China has a bigger economy than the United States in terms of purchasing power parity. As years go by– 2035, then 2050– China will inevitably emerge as the world's number one economy in terms of all other indicators as well. We need to understand this. Who knows? Maybe they do understand this, but are still acting this way. But this is a mistake. As for us, we always have stood against using sport for political aims. Dmitry Peskov: I saw the Far East Federal District there, am I right? Go ahead. Irina Trofimova: Good afternoon, Mr President. We are always glad to see you in Vladivostok. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. And I am always glad to come to Vladivostok, especially after it hosted the well-known international events of APEC, and after Vladivostok's revival and transformation began. I hope that everybody who lives in the Far East can feel and see it. Still, a lot has to be done. So, your question, please. Irina Trofimova: This is true, the transformations are tremendous, of course. However, I wanted to ask you about the following. My first poster reads:""One-room flat for eight million."" It does not mean that I want to sell it. The thing is that housing prices in the Far East have reached unprecedented highs. Given that we have a good level of construction, we are building a lot of housing, more and more rapidly, and many problems are being solved. Meanwhile, the price of a one-room apartment has reached eight, nine, ten and even 12 million rubles. It means that we are practically approaching Moscow prices. It has been greatly influenced by the Far East mortgage loans, which were a lifeline to many people, but it has had a major impact on the price increase. It is a real problem for the Primorye Territory. We are now among the top three regions for population outflow, the top three regions. That is, people are fleeing from the Far East. Mr President, something has to be done about it. A special mechanism to restrain housing prices is needed; otherwise Primorye, for instance, will find itself without young people. Vladimir Putin: Indeed, Irina, we have established an entire line of support measures for housing construction. Two-percent interest for the Primorye Territory and the Far East. Three percent for agricultural mortgage loans, and six percent for families with children. We have also extended the concessionary mortgage loan at a seven percent rate for another year. Of course, having a certain level of construction technology, although it is constantly growing, and building materials production, that is supply, it all affects the prices. However, high prices are not the only thing that matters. We have introduced the two-percent rate to make them lower and, in general, that worked. Depopulation happens not only because of rising housing prices. Of course, we are thinking about it, and for the country as a whole, because cheap mortgage loans lead to a price rise. Still, we built 90 million square metres. The positive effect is evident. The number of families improving their living conditions has been increasing many times over. It also concerns the construction of single-family homes. The present support is not enough, but we will push it further. The Far East has special needs that require a comprehensive approach. The goal is not only to put an end to depopulation, but, on the contrary, to make life there attractive in today's conditions. What do we need to do for that? Primarily, we need to develop the economy and create new modern, high-tech, interesting and high-paying jobs so that work becomes interesting. This is my first point. Second, we must develop the social sphere, strengthen the university on Russky Island, and other education institutions, as well as build schools and kindergartens to make life there comfortable. We have drafted an extensive programme for this, including the creation of priority development areas, the provision of low-cost lending, and so on. Entire clusters are being built towards this end. As you know, there is Zvezda plant not far from Vladivostok which is an unprecedentedly large shipbuilding company that even the Soviet Union did not have. One of the largest dry docks has been built there. Now, we can– if necessary, of course– build large naval warships there, but we can also build, and we are already building, special-purpose civilian vessels for servicing offshore areas, working at sea, etc. This is all happening. Did you know that people from European Russia go to work there? Why? Because it is an interesting job, salaries are good. These jobs are for people with high skills. This is the way to go in all other areas in the Far East, including further strengthening and creating the town of Tsiolkovsky and a new spaceport for civilian purposes. The automotive industry must be developed there, and not just large-scale assembly, but also on our own base, which is also happening. In general, we need to work in all these directions, and then life there will become attractive. There are plans in place; these are long-term projects. Still, work is underway and the situation is improving. If something needs to be done additionally, and if you have specific proposals, go ahead and draft them, and then send them to us. We will be happy to review and study them, okay? Thank you very much. Dmitry Peskov: Mr President, we are working on this… Vladimir Putin: I think everyone must be bored, so it is time to end. Let's do the following: one question each from this side, the centre and the other side. Dmitry Peskov: Let's do that. Dagestan. Please. Magomed Magomedov: Good afternoon, Mr President. Magomed Magomedov, Dagestan republican news agency. During a meeting with you, the head of our republic,[Sergei Melikov], invited you to Dagestan for the Year of Rasul Gamzatov and the poet's birth anniversary, which we will be celebrating soon. The republic is now facing an energy crisis in nearly all spheres: in water, in electricity and in gas supplies. The problems have been accumulating for decades; they did not appeared out of nowhere. We can see that you, the head of our republic and the Federal Assembly are aware of this problem, but no solution has been found so far because it is mostly connected with the commercial organisations that are working in the republic. Mr President, we need your help. In 1999, Dagestan was an important part of and played a major role in Russia' modern history. Today people in our republic need your influence more than ever, so that the officials at different energy companies, but primarily those that are subordinate to Rosseti, Gazprom and RusHydro, focus their attention on the problem and not just collect dividends in the republic but also invest in the infrastructure, so that people can live a befitting, high quality life in the republic. I would like to once again invite you to the Republic of Dagestan in the commemoration Year of Rasul Gamzatov. We know about your attitude towards Dagestan, and you know that Dagestan loves you. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Just a second, Magomed. I would like you to be more specific about the energy problems you are facing. Magomed Magomedov: Mr President, this is what I can tell you. The trouble is that our energy infrastructure is either worn out or unable to keep pace with the increasing demand. Of course, the regional authorities are implementing a number of projects, but they cannot do everything that needs to be done, while the people believe that the commercial organisations that are working in the republic are not fully aware of the problem. System operations depend on them much more. The vertical power system means that these organisations are controlled from the federal centre rather than in the republic, and we have no mechanisms to influence them. This is the problem. Vladimir Putin: Which companies? Just name them. Magomed Magomedov: Electricity supply companies. Vladimir Putin: Grid companies? Magomed Magomedov: Yes, grid companies. Vladimir Putin: Rosseti? Magomed Magomedov: Most likely the companies subordinate to Rosseti. I am not sure. Vladimir Putin: Alright, I will look into the matter. Anything else? Magomed Magomedov: Moving on, some water utilities are owned by private Russian companies, and are probably also part of RusHydro. Natural gas distribution to villages is another major challenge. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: I will definitely look into this, you have my word on it. As for Rosseti, they probably have their divisions there. On the question of water supply, we need to investigate this and the way the regional government organised all this. It is the regional government that oversees water distribution and wastewater disposal, or this function is assigned to a private operator. We need to get to the bottom of this. The same applies to RusHydro. We must examine this. I cannot answer each of the questions you have raised right now, but I do have a very clear understanding of what this is all about. We will look into it. Is that okay with you? Magomed Magomedov: Thank you, Mr President. Vladimir Putin: Please convey my best wishes on the upcoming New Year. In fact, Dagestan has a very special place in my heart. You can see that working in Dagestan promotes the careers of its leaders to new heights. For example, Mr Vasilyev became the head of United Russia's parliamentary group in the State Duma. Magomed Magomedov: Mr President, we feel your attention, and that you are always there for us, for which both the journalists and the people of Dagestan are grateful. Happy New Year! Vladimir Putin: Thank you so much. All the best to you too. Let's turn to the middle of the room. I see a young lady in green. Yes, go ahead please. Yuliya Izmailova: Good afternoon. Yuliya Izmailova, Editor-in-Chief of Molodoi Leninets newspaper, Penza. Vladimir Putin: Penza, you said? Yuliya Izmailova: The city of Penza. Mr President, next year pensions are expected to be adjusted for inflation at the rate of 5.9 percent, which is significantly lower than the actual inflation rate. In fact, prices are growing at a much faster pace. Do you have any plans to offset the difference for retirees? Under the law, pension increases must correspond to the rate of inflation. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Yes, I fully agree with you, and we must not forget this. The Government of the Russian Federation must do everything it can to deliver on the promises it made over the past years. Until now, we have been able to do this, in general, and we will definitely do it now. This is the first thing I want to say. Second, for reference, please note that next year we will take the corresponding decisions on law enforcement and defence agencies to provide for a more even income distribution to people working in law enforcement and defence agencies. This also must apply to military pensions. Dmitry Peskov: Let's give the floor to Public Television of Russia(ORT). Vladimir Putin: Yes, go ahead, please. Olga Arslanova: Good afternoon, Mr President. I am Olga Arslanova, Public Television of Russia. My question is prompted by our viewers that call us live. We know that large cities are carrying out serious and expensive infrastructure projects. Meanwhile, the countryside remains archaic in our country even in the 21st century. It lacks the simplest things. It happens that schoolchildren go by bus to a neighbouring village 20 km away because their school at home is in critical condition. It happens that buses do not run because the road has fallen apart. Sometimes, the situation becomes ridiculous. There is no toilet or water in a village, but it has internet installed. Is the state going to implement infrastructure projects in rural areas instead of just filling some gaps? Thank you very much. Vladimir Putin: Most certainly. First, this is being done under a relevant programme for the social development of the countryside, which will receive the required funds. This is the first point. Second, the projects, including the national projects I have already mentioned today are largely oriented to focus primarily on rural areas. Our villages have been doing really well in the past few years. This should certainly have an impact on the social wellbeing and social attitudes of the people that are giving us this level of production and confidence in providing the country with the necessary set of basic food products. Thus, I think we have already mentioned the programme for renovating existing schools and building new ones. These programmes will be primarily implemented in rural areas. This is what I requested and what will be done. As for the internet, there is a reason you said it is installed in rural areas whereas some basic amenities are missing. Of course, it is possible and necessary to think about basic amenities, but it is also important to have the internet up and running. It enables rural residents to get an up-to-date education and use many services online even in remote areas and small communities. As for small communities, additional funds are set aside for this purpose. In general, this is, of course, a big comprehensive goal that requires, in part, the development of infrastructure. A significant part of the funds planned for infrastructure development will be spent on the development of rural areas. And now the final question. Mr Peskov, let's have the final question. Dmitry Peskov: Alright. Valery Sanfirov, another veteran of the presidential pool. Valery Sanfirov: Mr President, just a small clarification. There was a quiz about a president who said that boycotting Olympic Games was wrong. Was it Trump? Vladimir Putin: No. Valery Sanfirov: I see. It must have been George Bush Sr. Vladimir Putin: Precisely. Valery Sanfirov: Very good. My question concerns next year, 2022. It does not seem to promise anything good, which means that it will be quite dull. You will continue to keep everyone wondering if you will run for one more term in 2024. The pandemic will most likely continue, and there will be some restrictions again. The WHO will likely find another reason for refusing to recognise Sputnik V. And our Olympic team will again perform without the national flag and anthem. In this connection, what do you think can bring us real optimism and happiness next year, not just flashes of it, as a famous writer and you have said? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Once again, what will next year bring? Valery Sanfirov: What will bring us real happiness and optimism next year, not just flashes of it? Vladimir Putin: Happiness and optimism? Carrying out our plans, what else? This is the essence of our work– to make life better for people. As for possible political, domestic political events, such as elections, I do not believe that this is what we should think about. A girl, your colleague, asked about serving pensioners' interests. This is what we should think about. The inflation rate has increased. Can we bring it down? And how can we adjust pensioners' incomes? Yes, they are increasing, but we must ensure that they keep pace with the inflation rate, like we promised. This is what all of us must aim for, all levels of authority– the federal, regional and municipal authorities must think about increasing living standards and improving the quality of life for the people. We have ambitious plans, and huge funds are allocated for implementation, and we must use them effectively, so that people can see that life is changing for the better. Happiness or not but this is what we must do. I will encourage the national authorities to work in this spirit so as to attain our goals and fulfil these tasks in the interests of Russian citizens. The final question must come from a woman. Let's give the mic to a young lady. Dmitry Peskov: Mr President, do you see anyone yourself? Vladimir Putin: No. Dmitry Peskov: Maybe Rossiya-Kultura? Vladimir Putin: Go ahead. Yana Muzyka: Good afternoon. Yana Muzyka, Rossiya-Kultura television. Mr President, there are more and more administrative and even criminal cases related to promoting extremism and accusations that someone's feelings were insulted. Creative professionals from the theatre, film or book industries can easily face charges, and even more so ordinary people for simply posting an image online. I wanted to ask about the line between protecting someone's feelings, moral standards, and the right of an artist to enjoy the freedom of artistic expression. Where should we draw this line? Vladimir Putin: You mentioned posting photos and artistic rights. Can uploading an image of Hitler or Himmler to the Immortal Regiment's website be seen as creative freedom? Let's consider this issue from that perspective. Of course, we need to ensure artistic freedoms, and freedom in general. After all, without it there is no progress, no doubt about that. The future would be quite grim, bleak and without any promise. Still, we need to understand that this freedom can defy its own purpose when it runs into the freedom of another person. You represent a media outlet, for example, and quite a respected one. Kultura is a very good channel. But why offend the Prophet Muhammad? Is this an act of artistic freedom? I do not think so. This is a violation of the freedom of worship, which offends the rights of the people who practice Islam, which leads to other, even more radical and extremist manifestations. Take, for example, Charlie Hebdo– they went to Paris and killed an entire editorial staff. We must make sure this does not go that far, right? This freedom needs to come from within and be rooted in respecting all those who might be affected by any extreme actions. I have said that Russia emerged as a diverse state from an ethnic and religious perspectives, so we have grown used to respecting each other's interests and traditions. This gives Russia a very solid foundation as an ethnically diverse state. We can see that other countries lack this culture of dialogue. So why import this deficiency onto our territory, and into our society? This would be like compromising one's immunity. However, this must be a question of self-regulated restrictions. For example, the heads and owners of Russia's major social networks came together, established an organisation, and devised their own rules on how to operate in a way that does not hurt people, harm teenagers, kids, etc. This is the way forward, in my opinion. And the final question, please. Go ahead. Zokhra Ishmukhametova: Mr President, good afternoon. Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon. Zokhra Ishmukhametova: Zokhra Ishmukhametova, Sputnik news agency. A question about Afghanistan. On August 15, we all watched as the Taliban took over in Afghanistan after President Ashraf Ghani, now the ex-president, fled. The question is, does Russia recognise the Taliban government? What is the outlook for Russian-Afghan relations? Vladimir Putin: I would like the relations between Russia and Afghanistan to develop in the best possible way. I am referring to our mutual interests in stabilising the region. For us, this is not idle talk, since we have open borders with the Central Asian republics, the former members of the Soviet Union, and naturally, the possibility of extremist infiltration raises understandable concerns. Among other things, there is the continuing flow of drugs from Afghanistan; some 90 percent of the opiates on the global market are Afghan-made. This is another alarming factor, of course. As for recognising it, generally, we need to proceed from reality, assuming that the forces that now lead Afghanistan are setting their minds on having all ethnic groups represented in the country's government. I think this is the only alternative that can, hopefully, pave the way for stabilisation in Afghanistan. What do we need to do now? We definitely need to help the Afghan people. This should primarily be done by those countries that have caused such enormous damage, such harm to the Afghan economy and Afghan society. Those who have been there for 20 years, have destroyed the local economy– they must be the first to provide assistance. For our part, we will do everything that depends on us. But the first thing to do here is to unfreeze Afghanistan's assets, the money it had in foreign, primarily American, banks, in order to provide the required assistance to the Afghan people. Otherwise, the country could plunge into famine; there will be grave consequences that will affect the neighbouring states as well. As for recognition, we are working collectively with all parties in international communication. We have our own position, and I have explained it clearly enough just now. But we will strive to achieve a consolidated approach. Is that it? Dmitry Peskov: Maybe, we will listen to one more woman? In the middle, the woman in red. Ms Sobchak, that's not you; you have already done your part. Ilona Ozerova: Good afternoon, Ilona Ozerova from Avtoradio. Finally, I would like to ask you a personal question related to the pandemic. First, do you feel that you are short of personal communication? Maybe, you feel the lack of emotions and impressions. You said you are talking to your subordinates at a distance of three metres. Is it worth talking without an-eye-to-eye contact? Or maybe videoconference is a more advanced means of communication, sometimes even more effective and, in any case, quicker? And a second question. Vladimir Putin: Just a second, let me answer the first one. A distance of three metres does not matter. We are at a greater distance now, but we can freely talk with each other. And when my colleague sits next to me, there it makes no difference at all. Plus, there is communication via modern channels. In general, those in charge of communication have done a good job. But, of course, I miss communication with my family, my friends and colleagues, those I need to meet with and sit next to. I think this affects me like anyone. Ilona Ozerova: And one more question about exercise. Are you managing to exercise during the pandemic? Are there any changes in your routine? If so, what are they? And the last question– about your leisure time. Again, the pandemic continues and you have a busy personal schedule. Do you ever have time to follow new theatre plays or cinema premiers? Do you follow the posts of any bloggers? Do you sometimes watch television dramas that are in the news? Vladimir Putin: Frankly, I do not follow bloggers. I have long stopped watching anyone since I quit my job as the Director of the Federal Security Service. As for sports and leisure, I have almost no leisure time, but I do get some exercise because I consider it my duty. I must be in good shape because otherwise it is difficult to work with my busy schedule, fulfilling the instructions of the Russian people. Happy New Year to all of you! I wish you all the best!"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67435,Telephone conversation with Prime Minister of Luxembourg Xavier Bettel,2021-12-22T18:15:00Z,NA,Vladimir Putin had a telephone conversation with Prime Minister of the Grand Duchy ofLuxembourg Xavier Bettel.,"The leaders discussed in detail issues related to the prospects of settling the conflict in the southeast of Ukraine and the migration problem at the border between Belarus and European Union countries. The President of Russia gave a principled assessment of Kiev's destructive actions that have led to a deadlock in the talks on settling the domestic crisis in Ukraine. Emphasis was placed on the need for a full and unconditional implementation of the Minsk Package of Measures by the Ukrainian authorities. At the Prime Minister's request, Vladimir Putin told him about the Russian initiative on long-term, binding security guarantees that would rule out NATO's further eastward expansion and deployment of weapons systems that threaten Russia in adjacent states, primarily Ukraine. Xavier Bettel supported the idea of increasing contact between EU structures and Russian representatives. The two leaders exchanged Christmas and New Year greetings."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67433,Meeting with Delovaya Rossiya head Alexei Repik,2021-12-22T14:05:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin held a working meeting with Head of the Delovaya Rossiya National Public Organisation Alexei Repik.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr Repik. President of Delovaya Rossiya Alexei Repik: Good afternoon, Mr President. Vladimir Putin: I can see here that the organisation has just marked 20 years. Alexei Repik: That is correct. Twenty years have gone by just like that. As you rightly noted, this year on December 10, Delovaya Rossiya marked its 20th anniversary. The Ministry of Justice registered the organisation on that day. We have come a long way since then. Vladimir Putin: How many members do you have right now? Alexei Repik: The organisation currently unites more than 7,000 entrepreneurs, mainly representatives of private non-commodity businesses. I hope that we can rely on such companies in our transition to a new model of economic growth, thus helping to improve the welfare of our citizens, fulfilling all the presidential executive orders and achieving the national goals you set. I would like to thank my colleagues in Delovaya Rossiya for their tireless work and for being the driving force for important changes, including national entrepreneurial initiatives that we spoke about not so long ago, during the Agency for Strategic Initiatives Supervisory Board meeting, and the national technology initiative. But it was your support that made it happen. Vladimir Putin: It was your active effort. Alexei Repik: Our effort actually met with a serious response. As an example, I would like to mention our most recent forum that was held before COVID-19, in February 2019. You issued a series of instructions, and a great number of proposals were almost immediately implemented. New families that had to sell their only home to improve their living situation were exempt from personal income tax. Regions started working on the tax rebate from investment. There are still adjustments to make here and there– and I will speak about this in more detail today. The profit tax exemption for educational organisations and healthcare providers has been extended. The donation procedure has been simplified. Payment systems have lowered their acquiring fees. They tried to bump the fees up again, but I think that we will still be able to fix it. By the way, simultaneous administrative action against a legal entity and its worker for the same violation has been removed from the new version of the Code of Administrative Offenses. In fact, I can say that there has been much progress. Vladimir Putin: You know, this is not the first time many of these matters have been raised. This is why it is so important for the state to keep up the dialogue with representatives of the business community. Of course, it is essential not only that we engage in dialogue, but also that both sides adequately contribute to it, and overall, we have been quite successful on this front. Alexei Repik: Mr President, thank you very much for your assessment. First, taking this opportunity, I would like to invite you to Delovaya Rossiya's annual forum. We usually hold it in early February, so in early February 2022 there will be a very packed agenda. We had to take a break in 2020 and in 2021, because of the pandemic, but I do think that if you can find an opportunity to take part in the forum in person, despite your very busy schedule, this will guarantee the event's success. We have already framed the forum's agenda by singling out the main blocks. Vladimir Putin: I will try to make it. Attending your events has always been a very interesting experience for me, because far from routine events, these forums are about substance and are held in a business-like manner. Alexei Repik: Yes, Mr President. In fact, we have already articulated a whole range of ideas. If you will allow me, I will briefly outline the discussion topics for the forum that enjoy the largest support among businesses. Vladimir Putin: Could you simply list them, so that we can discuss them later? Alexei Repik: Of course. I will just name them, as you have asked. The first one deals with the performance of the so-called regulatory guillotine. Much has been done in this regard, you know. The Government phased out more than 12,000 old, inadequate instruments and adopted 447 to replace them. These efforts are headed in the right direction. When this is the case, one always feels compelled to aim even higher. We would like to expand this effort to cover departmental letters and excessive reporting. There are topics where this approach is especially effective. Another block of issues relates to coordination efforts with regulators. In this field, the Federal Taxation Service brilliantly launched a project on consultations, substantiated opinions and explanations, which enables investors to inquire about future developments, get an opinion and proceed from there. If we succeed in expanding this pilot project to cover other agencies as well… We are proactively working together with the Federal Service for Supervision of Natural Resources, which is currently a key structure when it comes to launching new investment projects, and we got a lot of help from the senior officials. This also applies to the Federal Customs Service. If we get a chance to build on this initiative… Vladimir Putin: Every agency is special in its own way, but this does preclude them from being guided by shared approaches. Alexei Repik: Investment incentives are probably the largest segment. The economy is now posting high interest rates. Unfortunately, this is so, and we have to activate new lending mechanisms and to provide assistance. Today, I have already mentioned investment tax deductions and tax loans. By the way, I would like to thank the Government, which provided businesses with tax deferrals worth almost 55 billion rubles during the COVID-19 pandemic. Perhaps we should now talk about investment incentives, rather than only efforts to bail out businesses. It should be noted that the Russian economy probably coped with this tremendous stress and blow better than most, if not all, other economies. Vladimir Putin: This is correct. According to the Central Bank, investment volumes did not subside. Alexei Repik: They did not subside. But you see, we have to provide regions and sectors with diverse and wide-ranging investment. It appears that we should help those regions which lack well-balanced budgets and reimburse them for part of the federal budget's revenue shortfalls. Vladimir Putin: When I mentioned the Central Bank, I mostly meant lending volumes, of course. But, to be honest, investment levels… Alexei Repik: Corporate lending plans have now become more expensive, and we all realise this. This is probably linked with inflation that we import. Some of our foreign colleagues are not behaving very responsibly, they are printing money and saturating the economy with it. Vladimir Putin: We were even forced to implement some measures, as well, and to issue a small amount of money. What is to be done? But we did this much more prudently. Alexei Repik: This is absolutely correct. But I hope that we will be able to implement our most ambitious projects in these situations. And now, I would like to show you some of them and to discuss them, and many new projects can be launched. Although they may not be the largest projects, they are important for various entities and regions of the Russian Federation. Vladimir Putin: This is how it will be. Alexei Repik: Thank you very much. <…>"

Both sides expressed interest in further developing bilateral ties and contacts via different channels. It was noted in this context that as the First Mayor of Hamburg, Olaf Scholz was in charge of sister-city ties with St Petersburg for many years. Vladimir Putin spoke about the Russian proposals on long-term legally binding security guarantees that rule out any further expansion of NATO eastwards and the deployment of offensive weapons systems in the countries adjacent to Russia. In this context, detailed comments were provided on the content of the draft Russian-US treaty on security guarantees and the draft agreement on measures to ensure security of Russia and NATO member states, which were sent to Russia's Western partners, including Germany. Hope was expressed that serious talks would be organised on all issues raised by Russia. The problem of settling the domestic conflict in Ukraine was reviewed in detail at the request of the Federal Chancellor. Vladimir Putin gave an extensive update on the situation in this area, noting, in particular, that Kiev still refuses to honour its commitments under the 2015 Minsk agreements, which impedes the potential holding of a new summit in the Normandy format. It was agreed to continue exchanging views on the topics discussed and other international and bilateral issues during future contacts."

Vladimir Putin informed his French counterpart of Russia's diplomatic efforts in this area. The discussion also touched on the recent complications with settling the internal conflict in Ukraine, caused by Kiev's unwillingness to honour the Minsk agreements. The President of Russia emphasised that the possibility of holding a new summit in the Normandy format depends on Kiev taking practical steps to implement the Minsk Package of Measures. The situation in Mali was reviewed at Emmanuel Macron's initiative. During an exchange on the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement, the leaders expressed satisfaction with how the situation has stabilised and with the efforts to return to peaceful life and restore economic and transport links in the region. It was noted that Russia and France are coordinating actions on these issues and intend to continue doing so. Vladimir Putin directed attention to the restrictions that continue to be imposed on Russia Today news channel in France. Hope was expressed that our channel will be given the same opportunities to work without discrimination that French media enjoy in Russia."

Today, naval flags will be raised on nuclear submarines Knyaz Oleg and Novosibirsk as the new missile carriers are becoming part of the Navy. I would like to thank the workers of Sevmash, which is our leading manufacturer of nuclear-powered submarines, and to thank everyone who participated in designing and creating these modern ships. You have done an excellent job. The new submarines have a formidable striking power. Knyaz Oleg is equipped with Bulava ballistic missiles while all-purpose submarine Novosibirsk has Kalibr and Oniks cruise missiles and is able not only to effectively neutralise sea-based targets, but also to deliver high-precision strikes against targets on land. Very soon, Knyaz Oleg and Novosibirsk will become part of the Pacific Fleet and will significantly boost its combat potential. They will ensure Russia's security and reliably protect our national interests in the World Ocean. The new submarines are the first serial ships built under these projects, and we will continue to create these ships. Under the current state armament programme, five more Borey-A project submarines and six Yasen-M project submarines will be built and will join the fleet. Sevmash will build them all. We will step up our efforts to renovate the Navy, to build modern submarines and surface ships of various designs and classes, to simultaneously develop coastal infrastructure and, of course, to improve the social guarantees for military personnel and boost the prestige of military professions. Service in the Navy has become the life calling for many generations of sailors. The Defence Minister has just told me that seven family members of the Novosibirsk underwater missile cruiser commander, Captain 1st rank Shpirko, seven officers, have devoted their lives to service in the Navy at different times. This is a good example of preserving the glorious traditions of the Navy, devotion and loyalty to the Navy and the Motherland. In conclusion, I would like to once again thank everyone who was involved in creating these formidable ships. I am confident that Knyaz Oleg and Novosibirsk crews will make a worthy contribution to strengthening Russia's defence capability and protecting our people. I wish you every success in your service. I propose that we raise the flags."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67402,Expanded Meeting of the Defence Ministry Board,2021-12-21T14:30:00Z,Moscow,Vladimir Putin took part in the annual expanded meeting of the Defence Ministry Board at the National Defence Control Centre.,"Apart from the Armed Forces leadership, representatives of bodies of state power and public organisations, the meeting was attended by command officials from military districts, fleets and flotillas, military formations and units, as well as cadets and students of the Russian Defence Ministry's higher education institutions, who have been invited to attend for the first time. Following the meeting, the President toured a theme exhibition dedicated to the Defence Ministry Board's final meeting in 2021. Accompanied by Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, the President inspected promising samples of weapons and logistical support of the Russian army – advanced models of armaments, equipment, communications, intelligence and control. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, comrade officers, Let us get down to work. We have always prioritised and still prioritise the development of the Armed Forces and efforts to strengthen Russia's defence capability, and we will continue to do this in the future. Today, at the annual expanded meeting of the Defence Ministry Board, we will discuss what has been accomplished in the field of military development throughout 2021, what results have been achieved in the main areas, and, of course, we will chart future tasks. This is what we always do at the Board's annual meetings. I would like to note right away that, just like 2020, the outgoing year has been something extraordinary, mostly due to the continued coronavirus pandemic. You and I realise this. And it is of paramount importance that the Armed Forces efficiently and smoothly accomplish all of their tasks in this challenging context. For example, work continued on the modernisation of the Army and Navy on a grand scale. Consequently, the share of modern weapons exceeded 71 percent in the troops and 89 percent in the strategic nuclear forces. We continued to actively develop cutting-edge weapons systems. Some of them, namely the Avangard and Kinzhal systems, have been put on combat duty. The Navy accomplished a wide range of tasks. Russian ships and submarines constantly patrolled all important sectors of the world's oceans. A combined naval grouping and long-range aviation units successfully accomplished combat-training tasks in the Baltic and Northern seas and in remote areas of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. A group of submarines and other ships did the same in the Arctic Ocean, operating in difficult ice conditions. I also want to note a further increase in the level of troops' combat training. The results of the Zapad 2021 joint strategic exercises have shown this convincingly as the participants successfully practiced accomplishing the tasks of ensuring the security of the Union State of Russia and Belarus. Our military members in Syria acted honourably, as befits Russian soldiers. Their presence and assistance to the civilian population in solving humanitarian problems is making a tangible contribution to strengthening stability in that republic. Our peacekeepers have been helping to maintain stability in Nagorno-Karabakh for over a year now. Largely thanks to their efforts, the humanitarian situation has improved in the region; several districts have been demined, the social infrastructure has been restored, and historical and cultural landmarks have been preserved. I would like to thank the personnel performing peacekeeping tasks for their professionalism, endurance and perseverance. Military doctors deserve the highest praise for their hard work in difficult conditions, for their invaluable help to the civilian population: more than 30,500 patients have been treated at the Defence Ministry's medical facilities, almost half of them civilians. Military doctors have helped the civilian population in nine regions fight the coronavirus; they have even helped with the rehabilitation of patients who have suffered moderate or severe cases of the coronavirus infection and continue doing it. People continue to undergo rehabilitation treatment at 32 Defence Ministry health centres. Thank you. I would like to emphasise that the army itself has taken the necessary measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus in its ranks. Almost 100 percent of military personnel have been vaccinated. This made it possible to stem the tide of infection and protect service members' health, thereby ensuring high combat readiness among army units and divisions. True, the army has suffered from the coronavirus; there have been severe cases and losses – non-combat casualties. But overall, the Armed Forces have dealt with this problem successfully. The military construction force has been operating with high efficiency. I am referring to more than building a significant amount of infrastructure for the army and navy on time. The military builders have also helped to ensure uninterrupted water supply to Crimea and Sevastopol. They have also helped build multifunctional medical centres and other socially significant facilities in many regions. Comrade officers, Relying on the solid foundation and a powerful research and technology achievements of the past few years, we must definitely continue to improve and strengthen our Armed Forces, which is exactly what we will do. The military political situation in the world remains complicated, with increased conflict potential and new seats of tension in several regions. In particular, the growth of the US and NATO military forces in direct proximity to the Russian border and major military drills, including unscheduled ones, are a cause for concern. It is extremely alarming that elements of the US global defence system are being deployed near Russia. The Mk 41 launchers, which are located in Romania and are to be deployed in Poland, are adapted for launching the Tomahawk strike missiles. If this infrastructure continues to move forward, and if US and NATO missile systems are deployed in Ukraine, their flight time to Moscow will be only 7–10 minutes, or even five minutes for hypersonic systems. This is a huge challenge for us, for our security. In this context, as you are aware, I invited the US President to start talks on the drafting of concrete agreements. Incidentally, during our conversation he actually proposed appointing senior officials to oversee this sphere. It was in response to his proposal that we drafted our proposals on precluding the further eastward expansion of NATO and the deployment of offensive strike systems in the countries bordering on Russia. As you are aware, we have sent the drafts of relevant agreements to our American colleagues and the NATO leadership. We need long-term legally binding guarantees. Well, we know very well that even legal guarantees cannot be completely fail-safe, because the United States easily pulls out of any international treaty that has ceased to be interesting to it for some reason, sometimes offering explanations and sometimes not, as was the case with the ABM and the Open Skies treaties – nothing at all. However, we need at least something, at least a legally binding agreement rather than just verbal assurances. We know the worth of such verbal assurances, fine words and promises. Take the recent past, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when we were told that our concerns about NATO's potential expansion eastwards were absolutely groundless. And then we saw five waves of the bloc's eastward expansion. Do you remember how it happened? All of you are adults. It happened at a time when Russia's relations with the United States and main member states of NATO were cloudless, if not completely allied. I have already said this in public and will remind you of this again: American specialists were permanently present at the nuclear arms facilities of the Russian Federation. They went to their office there every day, had desks and an American flag. Wasn't this enough? What else is required? US advisors worked in the Russian Government, career CIA officers gave their advice. What else did they want? What was the point of supporting separatism in the North Caucasus, with the help of even ISIS – well, if not ISIS, there were other terrorist groups. They obviously supported terrorists. What for? What was the point of expanding NATO and withdrawing from the ABM Treaty? They are to blame for what is happening in Europe now, for the escalation of tensions there. Russia had to respond at every step, and the situation was continuously going from bad to worse. It was deteriorating all the time. And here we are today, in a situation when we are forced to resolve it: After all, we cannot allow the scenario I mentioned. Is anyone unable to grasp this? This should be clear. Sometimes I wonder: Why did they do all this in the then conditions? This is unclear. I think the reason lies in the euphoria from the victory in the so-called Cold War or the so-called victory in the Cold War. This was due to their wrong assessment of the situation at that time, due to their unprofessional, wrong analysis of probable scenarios. There are simply no other reasons. I would like to emphasise again: we are not demanding any special exclusive terms for ourselves. Russia stands for equal and indivisible security in the whole of Eurasia. Naturally, as I have already noted, if our Western colleagues continue their obviously aggressive line, we will take appropriate military-technical reciprocal measures and will have a tough response to their unfriendly steps. And, I would like to stress that we are fully entitled to these actions that are designed to ensure Russia's security and independence. As we know well, they are operating thousands of kilometres away from their national territory under different pretexts, including the need to ensure their own security. When international law and the UN Charter get in their way, they declare them obsolete and unnecessary. However, when something meets their interests, they immediately refer to the norms of international law, the UN Charter, international humanitarian law and so on. These manipulations are annoying. In this connection, as I have already said, it is important to continue planned, steady, systemic development of the Armed Forces, including in line with their priorities, set forth in the latest version of the National Security Strategy and the Concept for Building and Developing the Armed Forces through to 2030. Next year, we will have to focus on the following main tasks. First, it is necessary to continue the planned and well-balanced procurement of modern weapons and equipment for military units and to devote special attention to deliveries of high-precision systems, cutting-edge reconnaissance, navigation, communications and control systems. Second, combat and tactical training programmes should prioritise efforts to master modern weaponry, as well as new forms and methods of combat operations. In this connection, combat training programmes should be modified, so that they can be taken into account during exercises next year, including the Vostok 2022 strategic command post exercise. Third, all-out success in many spheres now directly depends on well-thought-out and rapid decision-making. In the military sphere, during combat operations, decisions are made in minutes or even seconds. It is therefore necessary to develop systems to support the decision-making process by commanders at all levels, especially at the tactical level, and to introduce elements of artificial intelligence into these systems. Fourth, it goes without saying that effective operational algorithms should be established at all levels, and advanced automatic systems should also be introduced. At the same time, we can see that modern military conflicts do not take place under pre-set patterns. As before, commanders play a key role in these conflicts. A lot depends on their knowledge, experience, personal qualities, and those who make truly unconventional decisions win battles. Consequently, during operational and combat training, it is necessary to train versatile commanders who possess knowledge in all fields. They should be listed in the personnel pool of top military commanders, and it is necessary to keep an eye on them even now, to guide them and to provide them with opportunities for subsequent promotion. And, finally, here is the fifth aspect. Given the complicated international situation, it is necessary to develop military and military-technical cooperation with states that are members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the Collective Security Treaty Organisation and to pay special attention to strengthening the defence capability of the Russia-Belarus Union State. Colleagues, One of our absolute priorities is to increase the level of social guarantees for the military personnel. Defenders of the Motherland perform special tasks which are often highly complicated, demanding and perilous. We will make sure that they are duly rewarded for their service. As in the previous years, the military allowance must be equivalent and even higher than the wages in the leading industries. We agreed on this with the Government several years ago. For your information, we have managed to maintain this correlation. According to forecasts, the average wage across the economy as of the end of the year will be 55,000 rubles and the average wage in the leading industries (oil, finance and transport) will be 63,200 rubles. According to my data (the Finance Ministry's numbers are slightly higher), the Defence Ministry's average military allowance for lieutenants in 2021 is 81,200 rubles. The figure may differ as all lieutenants are different and serve differently – but the average level of compensation is 81,200 rubles while the leading industries show 63,200 rubles. The Government must adjust the allowance for inflation and, of course, increase military pensions, in a timely manner and to the extent that will ensure that this correlation is maintained. We continue to provide military personnel with permanent housing as planned. This year, 4,350 servicepeople purchased new flats using housing subsidies. In the course of the next three years, some 9,000 servicepeople will receive the subsidies. We plan to allocate around 113 billion rubles for this purpose from the federal budget. The accumulative mortgage system continues to work effectively. Thanks to this programme, 15,000 military personnel have fulfilled their right to housing in 2021. Another 34,000 will obtain new housing in 2022–2024. Service housing is provided at the same rate. Some 35,000 servicepeople will have obtained it by the end of the year, which is 14 percent higher than our plan. We will continue to focus very closely on these and other issues concerning military personnel's social security. Finally, I would like to thank the leadership and staff of the Defence Ministry for their honest service and good performance. I am confident that you will continue to demonstrate professionalism and competence and use your best efforts to achieve high results. I wish you further success in your service for the benefit of Russia and our people. Thank you. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu: Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief, The global military political situation is deteriorating, and tension is growing on Russia's western and eastern borders. The United States is increasing its forward-based deployment on Russia's borders: a total of some 8,000 US rotation troops have been stationed in East European countries. Regarding the US group of forces in Germany, the United States has re-activated the Theatre Fires Command, which was responsible for the use of intermediate-range missiles before 1991. The new Multi-Domain Task Force was formed which will be armed with various offensive missile systems. Infrastructure for the deployment of a US armoured brigade is being created in Poland. The Aegis Ashore anti-missile capability will become operational soon. A similar BMD facility in Romania has already been put on combat duty. The deployment of the Pacific segment of the global US BMD system is ongoing. A Joint Force Command of the Allied Command Operations (ACO) has been established in Norfolk to control maritime communications in the North Atlantic and the Arctic. The United States and NATO are consistently increasing the scale and intensity of military training near Russia. These drills increasingly include the use of strategic aviation and simulated nuclear missile strikes at Russian targets. The number of flights by strategic aircraft near Russian borders has more than doubled. NATO pays special attention to redeployment of troops to the bloc's eastern flank, including from the continental part of the United States. The military drills include various scenarios involving the use of coalition groups of forces and non-NATO troops (Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine) against Russia. The desire of the Alliance to involve the Ukrainian armed forces in its military activities is threatening security, considering Kiev's attempts at a military solution in Donbass. The military development of Ukraine's territory by NATO countries is underway. The situation is being further aggravated by the deliveries of US and allied helicopters, unmanned combat aerial vehicles and guided anti-tank missiles. The presence of over 120 members of US private military companies in Avdeyevka and Priazovskoye, Donetsk Region, has been proved reliably. They are setting up firing positions in residential houses and social facilities and are preparing the Ukrainian special operations forces and far-right armed groups for active hostilities. Unidentified chemical warfare agents have been delivered to Avdeyevka and Krasny Liman for the purpose of provocations. The Ukrainian military keep up the shelling of civilian neighbourhoods in Donbass and the positions of the people's militias of the Lugansk and Donetsk republics to provoke a response. Destabilisation in Afghanistan is fraught with the export of terrorism and drugs to the CSTO countries. We are closely monitoring the developments and promptly responding to all threats to military security. The growing spread of the coronavirus is an additional factor that is affecting the situation. The Defence Ministry is making systemic efforts to counter it. Owing to the adopted measures, the rate of infection in the Armed Forces is 2.3 times below the national average, and the death rate is 50.4 times below it. The number of laboratories in the Armed Forces has been increased by 8.5 times and the number of tests brought to 50,000 per week, which is 32 times more than the figure for civilian healthcare. The time for PCR tests has been reduced from 24 hours to 1.5 hour. The registration of a new test that produces results in 30 minutes is nearing completion. Vaccines have been administered to 100 percent of army personnel and 70 percent of civilian staff. Planned booster shots are being administered under constant monitoring. Full-scale herd immunity has been achieved and maintained. Owing to your support, a complex of high-tech facilities of the 27th Defence Ministry Research Centre has been built in less than a year. Medications against new infections are already being developed there. The Defence Ministry is playing an active role in helping the civilian population. All your instructions on helping 16 regions and seven foreign countries with 5,000 medical workers, as well as supplying 71 tonnes of medications and over 1,000 tonnes of oxygen, have been fulfilled. All 32 hospitals built in 2020 are actively involved in eliminating the pandemic in all regions of Russia. A series of measures on countering the coronavirus will allow us to maintain the high combat readiness of the Armed Forces, carry out all planned assignments and improve the quality of the army and navy. As for the status of the Armed Forces, the staffing of officer positions has exceeded 96 percent. This year an additional 13,000 officers have been sent to the troops. The number of army personnel under contract has been double that of conscripts. Sixty seven percent of them have higher or secondary vocational education. Overall, the demographic setback of the past has been overcome and the staffing of the Armed Forces has reached 91 percent. Today, all ground troop commanders have combat experience. The relevant figure for pilots is 92 percent, for air defence specialists 58 percent, and for the Navy 62 percent. The chronic problem of permanent housing has been resolved after many years. Since 2018, army personnel have been receiving housing according to schedule. Over 19,500 people have been provided with permanent housing this year. The rates of providing service housing are not going down. This year, 35,000 people have received flats. Subsidies for housing sublease have been paid to over 64,000 army personnel. The absolute majority of the service personnel support the defence activities of the state and trust the country's leadership. About increasing the combat capabilities of our Armed Forces: the Strategic Missile Force has completed the rearmament of the first missile regiment with the Avangard ICBMs with hypersonic glide vehicles. The first Yars launchers have been put on combat duty at two other regiments of the Strategic Missile Force. The nuclear strategic aviation component has received four modernised Tu-95MS strategic missile platforms. One more Borei-A class nuclear-powered missile submarine armed with Bulava ballistic missiles has been put on combat duty in the Navy. As the result of consistent, large-scale efforts undertaken at the direction of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, the share of modern weapons in the country's nuclear triad has reached a historic high of 89.1 percent. A modern infrastructure is being created simultaneously with the delivery of the latest weapons to the Strategic Nuclear Forces. This year we have built 690 high-tech facilities. Over 2,400 new and upgraded weapon system have been delivered to the Army, and motorised and tank divisions and missile as well as air defence brigades have been deployed. Aviation and air defence missile brigades have been created in the Aerospace Forces. As many as 151 new and upgraded pieces of aviation equipment have been delivered. The air and missile defence forces have been equipped with over 30 new systems, including the S-400 Triumf and S-350 Vityaz air defence systems. A separate aviation regiment has been created and equipped with the MiG-31K interceptors armed with Kinzhal hypersonic missiles. The combat capabilities and command technology of the Integrated Space System (ISS) are being improved. The fifth Kupol satellite has been put into orbit. The construction of the western modernised ISS command station has been completed, and the station is operating in pilot mode. The trials of the Altius-RU long endurance UAV are over. Delivery of the Inokhodets and Forpost reconnaissance-strike UAVs is underway. The runways and basic infrastructure have been renovated at 29 airfields over the past seven years as part of upgrading the Armed Forces basing system, so that the new aircraft delivered there can use them. The Navy received three modern submarines, four surface ships, 10 assault boats, 17 ships and support boats, as well as three coastal missile systems. This year, the Navy saw four new military units formed, including an artillery regiment and a naval engineering regiment. State tests of the Zircon sea-based hypersonic cruise missile are nearing completion. Serial deliveries will begin next year. The coastal infrastructure facilities in Baltiysk and Novorossiysk have been commissioned. The construction of service housing in Gadzhiyevo is nearing completion. It will fully cover the needs of families of submariners, including the crews of the new nuclear-powered cruiser submarines that will enter service within the next four years. Almost 500 units of new and modernised equipment, 13,000 sets of landing equipment and parachute systems have been supplied to the airborne troops, and two airborne parachute regiments have been formed. Thus, the rearmament task set by the Supreme Commander-in-Chief is being fulfilled diligently. The share of modern weapons in the equipment of the army and navy stands at 71.2 percent. Measured in terms of modernisation, our Armed Forces are a global leader, while we rank ninth in terms of defence spending. As a result of the operational management of financial resources, over 258 billion rubles will be allocated to supply high-precision weapons. By 2026, the number of long-range high-precision weapon carriers will increase by 30 percent, and the number of cruise missiles of various types of deployment will double. A number of innovations are being introduced to implement the state armament programme and the state defence order. This concerns the conclusion of long-term, up to 10 years, state contracts, ensuring timely delivery of weapons and equipment to troops, as well as technological preparedness and uniform workloads for industrial enterprises. The share of such state contracts amounted to 83 percent in 2021. The construction by 2030 of 34 surface ships and submarines, 20 of which are ships of the high seas range, is a positive example of their implementation. This approach will ensure continuity between the state armament programme in force until 2027 and the new programme until 2033 currently in the works. An integrated approach to the maintenance and repair of aviation equipment is being implemented as part of the life cycle contracts that are concluded directly with the manufacturers based on the operating cost per flight hour. The terms and conditions of these contracts provide for the maintenance of 100 percent of the airplanes and helicopters in service. This made it possible to maintain the level of properly functioning aviation equipment at 83 percent or higher, which is more than double what we had in 2012. The unified information system for state defence order settlements created by the Defence Ministry has become the country's first tool for ongoing automated monitoring and control over the use of budget funds. Today, it is a key tool for taking decisions on making advanced down payments to the defence industry companies and adjusting the state defence order. As a result, despite the existing restrictive measures, the state defence order was 99.4 percent fulfilled in terms of purchases, and 99.7 percent in terms of repairs and modernisation. With regard to the force's readiness to perform assigned tasks, the main event of the exercises was the joint Russian-Belarusian strategic exercise West-2021, which showed the ability of the newly created rank-and-file groups to effectively perform tasks to ensure regional security. About 200,000 servicemen were involved, including 2,000 from the CSTO, the SCO and other countries. Serially produced assault robotic systems were used on a large scale for the first time in battle formations. The Armed Forces have carried out all planned combat training exercises, including 45 international exercises of various levels. This year, in the course of snap checks to test combat readiness of the troops, units and formations carried out regrouping at a distance of over 3,500 kilometres while carrying out training and combat missions at ranges outside assigned areas of responsibility. For the first time in modern history, an operational exercise was conducted with a group of the Pacific Fleet forces in the high seas area, where the forces of the fleet carried out a covert deployment in a remote region of the Pacific Ocean. An unparalleled integrated Arctic expedition Umka was conducted on the Franz Josef Land archipelago. All tested weapons have complied with their technical specs in high latitudes and low temperatures. There is growing interest among foreign countries in the International Army Games. It is the largest event of its kind and took place on the territory of 11 states. More than 6,200 military personnel from 42 countries took part in them. The Games were attended by over 1.5 million spectators. Intense combat drilling made it possible to increase the level of training of commanders and staffs in performing tasks on unfamiliar terrain, as well as to improve the cohesion of the Armed Forces' formations and units. In terms of implementing tasks abroad, the Russian contingent continues performing its peacekeeping mission in Nagorno-Karabakh. It has discovered and destroyed 26,065 explosive devices and conducted 222 humanitarian operations. As a result, Nagorno-Karabakh has been living in conditions of ceasefire, peace and security for more than a year now. The Russian contingent is the main guarantor of preserving peace in Syria. Aid was rendered to the Syrian state in settling the tensions that had escalated in the south of the country in summer. The direct participation of Russian advisors made it possible to avoid bloodshed and stabilise the situation in Daraa Governorate. Russian military personnel carried out over 3,000 humanitarian operations and delivered over 5,000 tonnes of cargo. Military medical workers rendered assistance to 132,000 civilians. Over 2,300,000 Syrian citizens returned to their pre-war places of residence. We continue improving the military and social infrastructure of our military bases abroad. The work on expanding the Western runway has been completed at the Khmeimim air base. The construction of a cultural and leisure centre and a sports complex on an overall area of over 8,000 square metres has been completed in Armenia. The Defence Ministry maintains cooperation with the armed forces of 109 countries. This graphically shows the futility of Western attempts to isolate Russia on the international arena. We continued strengthening allied relations with the CSTO, the CIS and the SCO. This year we conducted the third joint air patrol with the People's Liberation Army of China and the first marine patrol. We will continue this work. China, India, Algeria, Egypt, Vietnam and Myanmar remain our main partners in military-technical cooperation. Delegates from 109 countries took part in the Ninth Moscow Conference on international security last June. This was the world's largest military-political event in terms of its participants' lineup. The Army annual forum promoted international military-technical cooperation. It was attended by delegations from 117 foreign states, while the number of visitors exceeded 1.7 million people. Advanced military training. We have completed the establishment of a network of Defence Ministry universities and the digital transformation of military education, creating an integrated digital educational environment at schools and research establishments. We have organised the enrolment of over 13,000 cadets and trainees. The number of male enrolment applicants was over six and female applicants – 17 per place. As per your instructions, we have started to gradually increase the system of military training at civilian schools. At present, over 63,000 students are attending 104 military training centres. New blocks have been completed and equipped with the latest educational and material facilities at the Omsk Cadet Corps. The construction of a sports centre with a swimming pool and a skating rink has been completed at the Tver Suvorov Military School. In the next two years, we will establish a Suvorov military school in Irkutsk, schools for girls in Krasnoyarsk and Khabarovsk, and a school for gifted children at the ERA Military Innovation Technopolis in Anapa. Social protection. Mr President, thanks to your decisions, we have implemented additional social support measures for the military personnel who are protecting the security of the state under conditions involving risk to life. The Defence Ministry has allocated an additional 180.2 billion rubles to increase the number of military personnel serving under contracts in 2021–2023. Military pay has been raised by 3.7 percent this year. In 2022 and 2023, it will be increased over and above the initial plan. These measures are increasing the attractiveness of military service and the number of highly skilled professionals willing to join the Armed Forces. The Defence Ministry has created an efficient system of interaction with the authorities on issues of social support for military families. As a result, the number of military wives in need of jobs has decreased 19 times, and the number of children waiting for kindergarten places, 15 times. Work is ongoing to provide additional opportunities and privileges to military personnel and their families. Under the Russian Army Partners loyalty programme launched on November 1, military personnel have access to a 30 percent discount for a broad range of goods sold at Voentorg partner stores. The Defence Ministry's decisions on military medicine made it possible to bring it to the most advanced positions in the country. Today, 50 military medical organisations are offering telemedicine services, with more than 1,500 of such services provided in 2021, which helped reduce overall morbidity among military personnel. This year, the military construction complex has put into operation advanced Defence Ministry-operated medical facilities in Moscow, St Petersburg and Vladikavkaz, which made it possible to make qualified and specialised medical assistance available to a greater number of military personnel and civilians. In addition, in accordance with your instructions, a new diagnostic centre has been built in Kyzyl. Work is underway to build medical centres in St Petersburg, Moscow, and Tula Region. The total area of the sites under construction will amount to almost 80,000 square metres. Troop accommodation. Two military bases have been built on the Arctic islands and archipelagos, and in remote coastal areas. Combat duty of air defence units and coastal missile systems has been organised there. The renovation of five air fields to receive all types of aircraft is nearly complete. These measures made it possible to reliably protect Russia's Arctic borders against foreign states' aggressive military activities. Special attention is paid to northern deliveries. This year, more than 72,000 tonnes of various cargoes were delivered to 152 hard-to-access deployment stations. The deliveries were completed by October 1. Work to clean up the environmental damage to the Arctic continued. During the year, 3200 tonnes of scrap metal were collected and removed from the area. In all, over 28,000 tonnes of debris have been removed since this work began. This year, the military construction complex has implemented major infrastructure projects on a tight schedule within three, four and seven months. This was achieved through the use of standard and modern technical projects. As a result, one ruble invested returned more than two rubles worth of newly introduced fixed assets. Military settlements are being developed as planned. This year, 692 park and barrack housing area buildings and structures were built. Teamwork to build refuelling complexes at military airfields continues with four more refuelling complexes built this year. Oil companies invested 21.4 billion rubles in this project. The missile and ammunition storage system is continually improved with 66 new modern storage facilities built, which brought their total number to 602. In accordance with the instructions issued by the President of the Russian Federation, a Railway Force unit is reconstructing the Baikal-Amur Mainline at the Ulak-Fevralsk section, which is 339 kilometres long. The preparatory work was completed in full ahead of schedule. New railway track is being laid at the Drogoshevsk-Skalisty section. Property that is not used for the needs of the Armed Forces was transferred to municipal owners. This is an ongoing effort with 2,982 properties transferred this year. The funds thus saved were used to build new military infrastructure. Military-political work. Commanders-in-chief and commanders of military-political bodies continued to maintain the high level of moral and political state of the forces and their readiness to perform combat missions in any conditions. At the same time, the range of tasks addressed by the military-political bodies is widening. Much is yet to be done in this sector. In the year of the 76th anniversary of Victory, the Ministry of Defence has implemented major patriotic and cultural projects. Military parades were held in 28 cities. By tradition, the Main Naval Parade took place. In order to preserve the historical memory, 86 combat standards have been handed over to the constituent entities of the Russian Federation. The museum and temple complex has become a destination for a true Russian pilgrimage. Over 100 major events were held on its territory since the start of the year, which were attended by nearly three million people. A total of 248 Patriot parks have been opened across the country, 29 of these this year alone. Systematic work to educate young people in the military patriotic spirit has continued. Its core is the Young Army movement, which has embraced all the regions of Russia and includes over one million teenagers. This year, it has marked its fifth anniversary. Jointly with the leadership of Moscow and Moscow Region, we have organised the Avangard Centre for Military Patriotic Education of the Youth. Since the start of the year, over 10,000 young men and women have undergone primary combat and military training there. Identical centres are being created in all cities with a population of over 100,000. In keeping with your instructions, 40 such centres have been established to date. Earlier this year, the Defence Ministry organised a multi-function TV complex with studio hardware and equipment. It makes it possible to inform the public about the Armed Forces' development and activities at a new qualitative level. Thus, all conditions are available for making patriotic films on this basis on orders from the Defence Ministry and other armed agencies. Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief, All the tasks assigned to the Armed Forces for 2021 have been accomplished. The Armed Forces' combat capability has grown by 12.8 percent; the prescribed level of national defence capability has been ensured. The implementation of all signed contracts has ensured the delivery of over 5,000 main armament models. The rearmament of the Army and the Navy and regular servicing have made it possible to maintain military equipment in good condition at the level of 95 percent. Over 3,000 buildings and facilities with a total floor area of 2.5 million square metres have been commissioned. In 2021, the overall volume of capital investment transferred to users has exceeded 155 billion rubles. Thereby, the number of unfinished construction projects has been considerably reduced. Russian society has a high regard for the Defence Ministry's activities. Over 90 percent of Russian citizens are confident that the Armed Forces are capable of defending the country, and 88 percent are proud of the Army and Navy. I would like to outline high-priority tasks for 2022. Under the rearmament programme, we need to provide the Strategic Missile Forces with 21 launchers, with Yars, Avangard and Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles and place them on combat duty. The Air Force's strategic nuclear units should receive two Tupolev Tu-160M strategic missile carriers. The Generalissimo Suvorov, a Borei-A-class strategic ballistic missile submarine, should enter service with the Navy. Regarding general-purpose forces. Ground Forces, the Airborne Forces and the Navy's coastal troops should receive over 1,000 modern armoured vehicles, tanks and artillery systems. The Air Force and the Navy should receive 257 new and upgraded aircraft, as well as S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile systems for five air-defence battalions. The Navy should receive five submarines, 11 ships and three gunboats. Military units should receive two coastal missile systems. The number of contract service personnel should increase by 14,700. It is necessary to prepare and conduct the Vostok and Grom strategic command post exercise. We have to commission 3,000 buildings and structures simultaneously with procuring new weaponry and equipment. The digital transformation of recruiting offices should be completed in the next two years. On the one hand, this will make it possible to reduce personnel and on the other hand, to raise wages. The Defence Ministry has accomplished a lot for the sake of boosting the country's defence capability, but much remains to be done. Thus, over the years, huge overdue infrastructure-overhaul projects have accumulated at military bases and settlements. We are taking action, but this is not enough. We will ask the Government to triple funding for these purposes. We will complete an inventory of housing for officers by the end of the first quarter of 2022, and we will later suggest a plan for financing the allocation of such housing, as well as the required funding for housing sub-lease contracts. Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief, In accordance with your instruction, we will continue to ensure the sustainable development of the Armed Forces and to enhance their combat capabilities throughout 2022. We will discuss the results of our activities in great detail at our limited-attendance meeting. That concludes my report. Vladimir Putin: On an informal note, I would like to add a few words to what the Minister said and what I said in my opening remarks. Everyone is discussing this and, of course, primarily the Armed Forces. I am referring to our documents, our draft treaties and agreements on ensuring strategic stability that we sent to the leadership of the United States and NATO. We already see that some of our detractors are interpreting them as Russia's ultimatum. Is it an ultimatum or not? Of course, not. As a reminder: everything that our partners – let us call them that – the United States has been doing in previous years, supposedly ensuring its interests and security thousands of kilometres away from their national territory – they have been doing these tough things, the boldest things, without UN Security Council authorisation. What was the pretext to bomb Yugoslavia? Was it authorised by the Security Council, or what? Where is Yugoslavia and where is the United States? They destroyed the country. Indeed, there was an internal conflict, they had their own problems, but who gave them the right to conduct airstrikes against a European capital? No one did. They just chose to do so, and their satellites were running behind them yelping along. So much for international law. Under what pretext did they go into Iraq? It was Iraq developing weapons of mass destruction. They went in, destroyed the country, created a hotbed of international terrorism, and then it turned out that they made a mistake: ""The intelligence failed us."" Wow! They destroyed a country. The intelligence failed – that is all they had to say to justify their actions. It turned out there were no weapons of mass destruction there. On the contrary, everything had been destroyed as agreed. How did they go into Syria? With Security Council authorisation? No. They do as they please. However, what they are doing, or trying or planning to do in Ukraine, is not happening thousands of kilometres away from our national border. It is on the doorstep of our house. They must understand that we simply have nowhere further to retreat to. There are experts here, sitting with us, I stay in constant contact with them. The United States does not possess hypersonic weapons yet, but we know when they will have it. It cannot be hidden. Everything goes on record, successful or unsuccessful tests alike. We have a sense of when it might happen. They will supply hypersonic weapons to Ukraine and then use them as cover – that does not mean that they will start using them tomorrow, because we already have Tsircon and they do not – to arm extremists from a neighbouring state and incite them against certain regions of the Russian Federation, such as Crimea, when they think circumstances are favourable. Do they really think we do not see these threats? Or do they think that we will just stand idly watching threats to Russia emerge? This is the problem: we simply have no room to retreat. That is the question. Armed conflicts and bloodshed are absolutely not our choice. We do not want to see events go that way. We want to use political and diplomatic means to resolve problems but we want to at least have clearly formulated legal guarantees. This is what our proposals are all about. We set them down on paper and sent them to Brussels and Washington, and we hope to receive a clear and comprehensive response to these proposals. There are certain signals that our partners appear to be willing to work on that. However, there is also a danger that they will attempt to drown our proposals in words, or in a swamp, in order to take advantage of this pause and do whatever they want to do. To make it clear to everyone: we are aware of this, and this turn of events, these developments, will not work for us. We look forward to constructive and meaningful talks with a visible outcome – and within a definite timeframe – that would ensure equal security for all. This is what we will strive to achieve, but we can do so only if the Armed Forces are developing properly. In recent years, we have been able to manage this, and we have achieved a good level of combat readiness. I mentioned this, and the Minister has just reported about it. We are moving forward at a decent pace – the kind of pace that we need. There are matters that need more attention, such as the production side, which we deal with on an ongoing basis. As you may be aware, we meet in Sochi twice a year. Why Sochi? It is not because of the good weather, but because everyone is going there, and we tune out distractions such as routine matters and focus on the defence industry and the development of the Armed Forces. These meetings are quite meaningful and effective. To reiterate, there are many questions, but we are on top of them. I very much hope that we will continue to keep up this pace as we move forward in our efforts to ensure the security of Russia and its citizens. Thank you very much. Happy New Year!"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67411,Greetings to the IV Congress of Russian Popular Front,2021-12-21T09:00:00Z,NA,Vladimir Putin sent his greetings to the participants and guests of the 4th Congress of the Russian Popular Front nationwide movement.,"The message reads, in part:""Over the past decade, the Russian Popular Front(ONF) has come a long way, rallying many respected public organisations, and more importantly, hundreds of thousands of concerned citizens in all regions of Russia for implementing ambitious and much needed projects. It is notable that you not only monitor the efficiency of bodies of power at all levels and openly and frankly pinpoint problems, but you also actively contribute to their settlement in the interests of citizens. The main ONF initiatives include support for the volunteer movement, organising free meals for primary school pupils and additional payments to doctors, as well as creating the system of environmental inspectors. I would like to emphasise the#WeAreTogether project designed to consolidate society against the dangerous pandemic based on the values of solidarity and mutual assistance. Of course, I am also grateful to you for your painstaking, caring and consistent work with millions of requests people send to the Direct Line. I am confident and new proposals made during the Congress will become a substantial, integral part of the nationwide agenda and will contribute to increasing the effectiveness of the bodies of power."""

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67389,Meeting with Promsvyazbank CEO Petr Fradkov,2021-12-20T13:45:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with Promsvyazbank CEO Petr Fradkov.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: It's obvious that the organisation you head has established itself. You have succeeded in doing this. Today I would like to discuss separately and to give priority attention to two items: the state defence order and its servicing, and the military mortgage scheme. Promsvyazbank CEO Petr Fradkov Fradkov PyotrPromsvyazbank CEO: Mr President, as per your instructions, we are establishing a base bank for the defence industry at Promsvyazbank. Of course, our main task is to service the state defence order and to finance defence industry enterprises. At this moment, over 70 percent of enterprises on the register of the Industry and Trade Ministry are our customers. If I may, I would like to give several figures, Mr President. The financing limit for defence industry enterprises is 1.5 trillion rubles, where at least 800 billion rubles' worth of loans are issued at a preferential interest rate of 5–5.5 percent annually. In this sense, we are acting in accordance with our mission to implement the task you have set us, which is not only to remove sanction risks from the banking system in general, but also to provide soft-term financing to defence industry enterprises. The same principle is being applied to the servicing of the state defence order and the contracts proper. We are servicing nearly 70 percent of state contracts signed by the Defence Ministry as a government customer. This is quite a lot. Back in the best periods, authorised banks serviced approximately 40 percent of contracts. In our case, the volume of transactions is huge: between 40,000 and 47,000 per day. Moreover, we also guarantee fail-safe service, which is of crucial importance to us. At the same time, I would like to point out the following. We are not only working with enterprises and the Defence Ministry proper, but it is also extremely important for us to make our banking products available to military personnel. This is an important sphere. One such product is military mortgage. This is a broad subject. Our bank is an absolute leader when it comes to this banking service: our portfolio of military mortgages is worth 82 billion rubles. This form of assistance has been recently provided to 50,000 military personnel families. We also take competitive terms into account and continue to develop this segment: as of now, our market share for this product is nearly 45 percent, and we will continue to make use of and strengthen our status as the base bank. I would like to give several more figures, if I may. It is clear that our main function is to service the defence industry, but it is also extremely important to develop as a universal banking institution, in accordance with the initial decision. It is very important that we have tried to find a suitable format for remaining an effective market institution and to grow stronger as a bank while working to accomplish our special mission. We have grown a lot stronger recently. Our assets are currently worth 3.7 trillion rubles, which means that our bank confidently holds sixth place in the banking system, and we continue to actively develop. Vladimir Putin: Profit is growing. Petr Fradkov: Profit is also one of our main indicators– we are guided by it. As for such a strictly market indicator as return on equity, we are also at the same level as our competitors in a positive sense. It is very important for us to remain an effective institution rather than simply an instrument for distributing budget funds. Finally, the corporate civilian sector is important for us too. We are also working with small and medium-sized businesses where we have strong positions as well. Thus, our portfolio for small and medium-sized enterprises is almost $800 billion rubles. Importantly, these are not only businesses involved in state defence order but, as a matter of fact, civilian companies– civilian mortgage and civilian aircraft leasing. All this is done through us, under the programmes you know well, for instance Sukhoi Superjet and helicopters, to name a few. Vladimir Putin: It is, of course, necessary to prop up defence industry enterprises when resolving diversification issues. Petr Fradkov: This is a separate area of our work. We understand that this is also our mandate. It is natural because we are working… Vladimir Putin: This applies precisely to medium and small-sized businesses. Petr Fradkov:…we are laying emphasis on this as well. Now the diversification portfolio amounts to 200 billion rubles. Vladimir Putin: In other words, you have singled it out as a separate area? Petr Fradkov: It is a separate area of our business. It is closely tied to defence. Vladimir Putin: I see. What can you say about the implementation of the tasks assigned to the defence industry in this context? How quickly will they be carried out? Petr Fradkov: We are conducting a special rating of corporate readiness for this work. In general, we are seeing that businesses are finally coming to realise that this is a natural environment for their existence and development. This is not something imposed on them from above but a natural way for them to survive in the near future. I am referring to a swing: either they will have to work in some areas of state defence order or compete in civilian markets. We are seeing that not all companies are ready for this, sometimes due to some difficulties with personnel. On the other hand, they do not know how to compete in market conditions. Vladimir Putin: Civilian market conditions. Petr Fradkov: These things are a bit different. It is not that they do not want to do this. Probably, they do not always know how to do this. Apart from using strictly financial instruments, we, also as a bank, are trying to draft non-financial support measures for them, to help companies focus on this area. Vladimir Putin: Diversification will certainly increase their technological potential, and, hence improve their work in their main line– defence production. Petr Fradkov: I think more and more businesses are coming to realise this. Vladimir Putin: Good. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67387,Congratulations on Security Agency Worker's Day,2021-12-20T09:00:00Z,NA,The President congratulated current officers and veterans of Russia's security agencies on their professional holiday.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrade officers, Dear veterans, I would like to congratulate you on Security Agency Worker's Day. This professional holiday has been celebrated for more than 25 years and has become a symbol of respect and gratitude to people who safeguard the security of our citizens, society and the state, protect the sovereignty and stability of Russia's constitutional order, combat terrorism and extremism, defend the interests of their Motherland while being far away from it. I would like to express my warmest words of gratitude and wish good health and prosperity to the security agencies' veterans. You have honourably withstood many difficult challenges and have overcome them both in time of peace and war, and despite the risks you have faced, you have always displayed professionalism and commitment in performing the tasks before you. With unprecedented courage and determination you have proved that there is nothing more valuable than faithful service to the Motherland and your people. New heroic pages in the history of national special agencies are now being created by current generations within your ranks. I am confident that you will always toe the line of your legendary predecessors and will honorably continue the traditions they have established of being the reliable protectors of the Motherland. Comrade officers, We are witnessing a very difficult international situation today, the nature and the scale of today's challenges and risks impose high demands on security agencies officers in, first and foremost, resolving our primary, top-priority objective, which is waging a fierce and an uncompromising battle against terrorism. Over the last few years, we achieved significant success and maintained an overall positive dynamic in this difficult, enormously responsible area. We have managed to dramatically reduce the threat of terrorism. In the last 11 years more than 200 terrorist acts were prevented, and the number of terrorist crimes committed was diminished exponentially over this same period. The vast majority of such crimes are prevented in the early stages of preparation. Some 61 crimes, including 32 acts of terror were prevented in the 11 months of this year thanks to your coherent and efficient work. This is a strong result. Yet many problems remain. It is important to stay on the offensive and do so with efficiency, liquidating cells of international terrorist groups in coordination with the National Anti-Terrorism Committee, identifying and cutting off their contacts, and not allowing their recruiters and emissaries to undermine us. Other priority objectives include continuing our offensive tactics in counterintelligence and the fight against corruption and securing reliable protection of state borders. Our citizens expect new successes from you in fighting extremism, which poses a direct threat to Russia's unity. Any demonstration of xenophobia, social or religious animosity must be dealt with harshly, and we must not all allow people, especially young people to be drawn into in illegal anti-state activities. The role of the Foreign Intelligence Service in ensuring our comprehensive security is growing. First and foremost, this requires the prompt and high-quality analysis of information coming from abroad, the drafting of forecasts on developments in the world overall, and in specific regions. I would also like to highlight the professional and precise work of the Federal Guard Service and the Chief Directorate for Special Programmes. I have no doubt that you will continue to work just as reliably and efficiently. Friends, You are well aware that both the state and our people are doing everything necessary for you to carry out your productive work and for the further strengthening of the special agencies, technically, operationally and in terms of personnel. And this potential needs to be used to its full extent, to efficiently carry out all the objectives set before you. I am confident that you will continue your conscientious work and will achieve substantial results in all the key areas that your agencies are responsible for. I would like to thank Russian special agencies' officers for the loyalty to their duty and the oath they have taken. Congratulations on this holiday once again. I wish good health and all the best to you and your families. And, of course, happy upcoming New Year of 2022!"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67383,Plenary meeting of the RSPP Congress,2021-12-17T16:50:00Z,Moscow,Vladimir Putin took part in the plenary meeting of the 30th RSPP Congress.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues, Friends, I am happy to welcome all participants in the Congress of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. First, I would like to congratulate the RSPP on the anniversary. This year your highly respected organisation which united the country's biggest, leading companies and enterprises, celebrates its 30th anniversary. During these years– and this was a complicated, difficult period in the development of new social relations, a period of""moving into adulthood"" of the domestic market economy– the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs has earned a reputation of a reliable partner of all branches of government and all civil society institutions. Constructive relations between the state and business are growing stronger with your direct participation in the interests of the development of Russia and our regions. We are working together to ensure economic growth and resolution of priority social tasks, including the renewal of the labour market, professional education and strengthening of such important institutions as charity and volunteering. I am grateful to you for such active participation in and major contribution to the implementation of our national agenda and to the increasing of Russia's personnel, investment, industrial and export potential. I know that shortly before out meeting– Mr Shokhin has just told me this– Alexander Shokhin was reelected as President of the RSPP. I congratulate you and wish you all the best and future success. Colleagues, I highly appreciate our format of communication and regular meetings, which, as a rule, take place at the end of the year. Before the pandemic, they took place in an informal setting as well, but, unfortunately, there are restrictions now, which I will talk about a little later. Traditionally, at this time, both businesses and government bodies sum up the results, analyse what they have managed to accomplish or are just planning to do; in a word, they are balancing the books. I will allow myself to outline certain results and trends as well. The objective figures– I will not list them now, as you already know everything about them, in general– are still saying that by the middle of this year the Russian economy had recovered from the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic and reached the pre-crisis level. The employment figures are also back to where they were in 2019. This relatively quick recovery of economic dynamics is a tangible and visible result of the work done by the entire business community, including large, small and medium-sized Russian companies. The absolute majority of our entrepreneurs has acted and continues to act responsibly with regard to their teams. They do not think only about how to overcome the current challenges, but about how to move forward as well. I am sure that thanks to precisely this approach by the business community, large-scale measures to support the economy, employment, and system-forming industries that have been implemented by the state have been effective. Of course, we all need to strengthen this experience of partnership which we need if we want to respond to unconventional, sometimes even extraordinary, challenges and, no less important, to properly address the country's long-term development goals. We are now entering precisely this phase. After a quick recovery, we need to achieve fast and high-quality growth. A large-scale transformation of the economic life is lying ahead, including digitalisation, environmental agenda, the creation of novel industries, and frontal development of infrastructure. We will address these tasks as a team, because it is impossible to imagine it done otherwise. I digress, but all the key economic decisions during the pandemic were taken as a result of a dialogue, and we discussed specific steps with the participation of business associations and trade unions. This, by the way, largely made it possible for us to strike a balance between forced restrictions associated with the pandemic, protecting public health and ensuring stability of the economy and preserving jobs, employees and teams, and individual incomes. It is important to maintain this balance. This task requires flexible, well thought out decisions. Nothing should be done in the midst of some frontal attack. In this context, I would like to talk about the issue that concerns all branches of the economy and, most importantly, all citizens of our country. I am referring to vaccination certificates. As you know, the discussion of the draft law that was supposed to establish a mandatory requirement for this certificate on transport– on a plane or in a train– was removed from the Duma's agenda. As for a law on mandatory certificates to enter public places– shopping centres, cafes, restaurants and cultural institutions, the State Duma adopted it yesterday in the first reading. Of course, this draft law requires adjustments because in drafting such sensitive norms and regulations it is necessary to consider the nuances and real-life situations. In this context, I am instructing the Government to complete the work on vaccination certificates in public places in cooperation with the State Duma, the Federation Council, employer associations and civil society representatives. We need to consider all the issues that worry our people. The law must be clear-cut, explicit and understandable. I would like to add that prior to the adoption of any changes, our Government colleagues must be completely prepared, technically, for the use of a system of certificates. This system must work reliably to protect the health of our people rather than create more difficulties for them. But I cannot just end this at a point that is expected so much by some public organisations and figures. I cannot do this for moral considerations or by virtue of my official duties, because the situation on countering the coronavirus remains very serious and tense. Look, just recently we had 41,000 new cases a day. Now we have 26,000–28,000 cases. It appears the incidence rate has been almost cut in half. Still, this is also way too much for us. The mortality rate has increased and COVID is largely to blame for this in different ways. This is not happening because people are hiding anything; it is simply impossible to predict all the consequences. Look at what is happening in relatively well-off countries. I am talking about the spread of the new omicron strain. The consequences of this are still unknown. Some researchers say this is a lighter version whereas others talk about potential serious consequences after recovery. There is a sharp increase in the number of coronavirus cases among children and they have serious consequences. We need to be aware of this. What is happening in the countries with a relatively favourable situation in public health? From what I have seen, and oddly enough, Germany has fairly low vaccination rates compared with other European countries. Now, word is that there are not enough vaccines for booster jabs. By the way, according to preliminary estimates, our Sputnik V is working well, perhaps, even better than other vaccines in combating the omicron variant. We will have a definite answer within a week when the researchers give a final assessment. In this regard, we can even share the vaccines that we have, I mean, for booster jabs, for the European countries as well, provided, of course, they need and want it. It is necessary to work more energetically and more substantively with the WHO, to heed its recommendations and the recommendations provided by specialists. To follow up on the European countries, Great Britain's population is 67.2 million. We have 146 million people in our country. I already mentioned that 26,000–28,000 people are falling ill with COVID-19 every day in our country, whereas in Great Britain, according to their official figures, it's more like 88,000. Their population is almost half of ours, but the number of cases is almost three times as high. Why am I saying this now? The New Year's holidays are fast approaching, and people will move around a lot. Some enterprises, your enterprises, in fact, are integrated non-stop works, and will remain operational during the holiday. I want to reach out to you and once again remind our people that, no doubt, the New Year's holidays are a special period in the life of every person and every family where people want to see their loved ones and visit them. The New Year's holidays always evoke some positive fairy-tale-like expectations for the future. This is good, and, of course, the holiday is a time for celebrations. But it is also important to heed the recommendations of the specialists if we want to have a really happy future. This is a serious matter. You know how it works. After the first toast, people tend to forget about precautions. This should not be the case today. Everyone needs to take a careful look at these recommendations and do their best to follow them. To reiterate, we are ready to provide Sputnik Light to the countries that would like to use it for booster jabs, since we have enough of it to share with other countries. As you are aware, our specialists are now working in the Republic of South Africa, and I want to thank our colleagues from South Africa for hosting them. In conjunction with their colleagues from South Africa, they are studying this virus variant. By the way, 75 percent of the people in South Africa that are ill with COVID-19 have come down with the new omicron variant. Let's continue. I was just talking about one specific bill, but the requirements for high quality and clarity apply to all our legislative and law-making activities, to regulatory practice. This is important for every person, and this is the most important condition for business growth and investment activity in the country. With your direct involvement, we have already done a lot to improve both legislation and regulatory enforcement practices. But many problems remain; I know you face them. But life is complex and diverse, as we say in such cases, and we will have time to talk a little more and exchange views on the practice of applying the legislation we have developed, and possibly on other issues that need to be regulated legislatively. So, we will certainly continue to cooperate with you, and will apply and fine-tune the best international and domestic practices to support investment activity and private initiative. This is fundamentally important now that, once again, the national economy has recovered; we need to transition back to long-term, high-quality growth immediately, without a pause. We have substantial state resources and great business potential for this, primarily when it comes to the flagships of our economy. So, congratulations– most large companies' financials have gone up of late. Companies have been reporting growing profits, especially in industries that are now benefiting from active foreign markets. Each company reports its own statistics, so we have some generalised figures: from January through September 2021, total net profits came to 21.6 trillion rubles, or 63.7 percent more than in same period of 2019, the pre-pandemic year. And compared to last year, the increase is 79.6 percent. Obviously, businesses primarily channel their growing revenue to financing current expenses, to repay loans and raise employee salaries, and so on. Average salaries are also increasing, not just in numerical terms, but in real terms, and this is very good. It is no secret that significant resources are being spent to pay higher dividends to shareholders. By the way, the Federal Tax Service's monitoring of Russia's largest groups of companies' performance confirms these trends. They monitor their profits, dividends paid and investment projects and of course, the tax benefits specific groups of companies enjoy are taken into account. The Government always analyses this carefully and reports back to me in a timely manner. Let me emphasise the following: the steady revenue flow that our leading companies are now receiving cannot be simply scattered or used up. If we yield to temptation, it will, in the long run, lead to defeat and a decrease in domestic businesses' competitiveness in global markets which are undergoing rapid change. We must think strategically and see the growth perspective. To reiterate, the financial resource that we have is a powerful base for expanding production, increasing capital investment, and launching new promising business initiatives, basically, things that drive the national economy and improve the well-being of our people. We met with many of the people in this audience in March. Back then, we agreed that the Government, along with the business community, would draft additional measures to support projects that are financed from the equity capital provided by the private sector. Today, I propose exchanging views on the progress in this respect, the remaining problems that need to be solved, and the investment areas that you and your management teams consider the most attractive and promising. Of course, when assessing capital investment, business looks carefully at return on investment numbers, economic and financial efficiency, as well as stability and predictability in the investment environment. But here is what I would like to add to this. Over the past few years, sustainable development has taken a special place on the global business agenda. Business owners and shareholders now focus not only on expanding or upgrading production facilities, but also on the environmental well-being of cities and regions, entire countries and even continents, infrastructure development and improvement of territories. Modern international terminology has an acronym for this approach: ESG; no doubt, you are aware of this better than anyone else. In fact, though, the issue is about something that has long been called in Russia the private sector's social responsibility. There is nothing new or surprising in this for us. I know each of you can share your own experiences in this area and the steps taken by your companies to implement sustainable development principles. I am prepared to discuss this today as well. Before we move on to the discussion, I would like to once again wish the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs a happy 30th anniversary. I hope you are also aware that an executive order was signed on December 3 awarding the RSPP team with an honorary badge of the Russian Federation For Meritorious Service. Today, in this audience, I am pleased to present you with this well-deserved state award. <…>"

Dispatch centres supervise the reliable operation of the country's entire energy system to provide a stable power supply to social facilities, industrial enterprises, and transport infrastructure, and to ensure a comfortable life for people. It is important that the team is a worthy successor to the strong traditions of many generations of energy workers, building on their experience, widely introducing advanced digital technologies, and making a significant contribution to augmenting the solid potential of the Unified Energy System."""
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67377,Meeting with ASI General Director Svetlana Chupsheva,2021-12-16T22:30:00Z,Moscow,Vladimir Putin met with General Director of the Agency for Strategic Initiatives (ASI) Svetlana Chupsheva.,"ASI General Director Svetlana Chupsheva: Mr President, you have set us a task to boost economic growth and to launch a new investment cycle. I would like to say a few words about how the Agency for Strategic Initiatives is contributing to this. We have just been discussing the quality-of-life ranking. I would like to add that we are now finalising the investment appeal ranking as well– on a national scale– taking into account the new tasks that you have set, that the regions have set, and most importantly, taking into account entrepreneurs' requirements for the ease of doing business. What have we done? We have added several new indicators for evaluation, such as obtaining permits, gaining access, connecting to gas and water, as well as issues and procedures with the lease of land, land plots. There is a whole new block for the evaluation and creation of infrastructure for technology entrepreneurship. There is something I wanted to ask. We have always measured administrative pressure on business for the ranking– everything related to inspections by various authorities. We have repeatedly raised the issue of forceful pressure on business. Now we can take a second step here: the For Business platform we have been implementing together with the Prosecutor General's Office, the Investigative Committee, the FSB, and the Ministry of the Interior– representatives of all these agencies at the level of deputy heads are included in the platform's supervisory board. Entrepreneurs from any region can submit a complaint to this platform, a petition, a report saying the business disagreed with an inspection, with investigative actions or criminal prosecution. And it is very important… President of Russia Vladimir Putin: No intermediaries. Svetlana Chupsheva: Yes. And it is very important that each complaint is considered by these agencies' central offices. The effort has already become systematic, and it is very important that our colleagues in the regions have joined in– we organise joint meetings at the[federal] district level, and discuss matters with regional authorities, with entrepreneurs, and law enforcement agencies; we do awareness-raising work, and we get lawyers involved in that. Would it be possible to add these measurements as monitoring indicators to the national investment ranking methodology, to measure annual changes in all constituent regions? We could use it for adjustments. We will see which regions record the greatest pressure from the law enforcement agencies, and will work this out with the central offices of the respective departments. If you support us, we are ready to work it out with our colleagues. Vladimir Putin: Yes, this is a good idea. Svetlana Chupsheva: Mr President, here comes the second part. I mentioned this as a new strategy as well and it is about targeted work with the constituent regions of the Russian Federation, when we, guided by an analytical toolkit in the form of feedback from residents and entrepreneurs, decide what projects or breakthrough growth points can be launched in the territories. After that, we will join efforts with the local teams, analysts and the governor to create such projects. Some governors have already come up with their first reports. It is critically important that Maxim Oreshkin works with us. Most importantly, the region receives federal support for these projects, which are needed primarily by residents and businesses, in terms of infrastructure support and being included in national projects and federal programmes. The third block, where we also see major opportunities for new drivers for the regional economies, includes interregional projects that will provide a multiplier effect. We are currently carrying out several such projects. One of them concerns the social sphere and medicine. It is an interregional project for children's centres providing specialised high-tech medical help for children. Today, we have regional and federal centres, but there are many complicated cases across the country where specialised medical help is needed. Doctors in Moscow or St Petersburg have constant practice, whereas specialists in remote regions in Siberia and the Far Eastern Federal District simply cannot gain enough experience in such operations or building such a system for providing medical help. An interregional project for an interregional centre can help. I am not talking about new infrastructure. All of that can be based on existing regional infrastructure. We propose launching a pilot project in the Far Eastern Federal District which has the highest infant mortality rates nationwide. The Far Eastern Federal District's regions are supportive of this idea. We went there and toured the regional children's hospitals in the Primorye Territory and the Khabarovsk Territory together with federal specialists, experts, and officials from the Ministry of Healthcare. What makes a medical centre? First, human resources, including proper staffing and mentoring by federal specialists. It also includes properly equipping such centres to comply with international and domestic protocols, with federal centres providing such medical help. Proper routing and transport services are also part of this, since logistics must be brought up to code as well. One way or another, we have estimates by territory, and we have practical experience. We are prepared, in conjunction with the Ministry of Healthcare, federal specialists, and the Association of Russian Surgeons, to develop regulations governing such interregional centres, as well as requirements and criteria to identify the diseases that make particular young patients eligible for treatment at the interregional centres. The tentative bases include the Khabarovsk Territory(Khabarovsk Regional Children's Hospital No. 1) and Vladivostok(Territorial Children's Hospital No. 1) which have adequate staff and the necessary infrastructure. So, with your support, we are prepared, in conjunction with the Ministry of Healthcare and the regions, to work on this pilot project. According to the experts, child mortality rates can be reduced by 10 to 20 percent in one year. Vladimir Putin: We will discuss this with Ms Golikova and Mr Murashko. We will work on it together, this is a good idea. Svetlana Chupsheva: Of course. Thank you, Mr President."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67376,Meeting of the Agency for Strategic Initiatives Supervisory Board,2021-12-16T22:05:00Z,Moscow,Vladimir Putin chaired a videoconference meeting of the Supervisory Board of the autonomous non-profit organisation Agency for Strategic Initiatives to Promote New Projects.,"Before the start of the meeting, the President visited an exhibition of ASI's achievements and future projects. The President was shown seven stands featuring ASI's main projects and plans for its activities in 2022–2024.*** President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, Today– we have just learned about the projects, and I will tell you about them later– but I would like to start by saying that today we are holding an important and, even in some sense, a special meeting of the Agency for Strategic Initiatives(ASI) Supervisory Board. The Agency should determine its goals and tasks for the next three years and record the key areas of its work, which should logically continue its entire history. I would like to start with its landmarks. A decade ago, in December 2011, the Agency was instructed to implement the National Business Initiative. Its efforts produced not only up-to-date regulations and procedures for doing business that were new and more effective. The changes proved to be much more profound. The regions saw more managers that make decisions with due account for the interests and requirements of people doing their own business. Supporting ideas and individual projects, you have always striven for proactive, systemic changes. When I say""you,"" I am primarily addressing the Agency as such. Thus, the WorldSkills championships have actually developed into a nationwide movement in Russia, new programmes of vocational training and a broad network of additional education for children, very often in the professions of the future. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the WorldSkills junior section and the team of the Boiling Point project on winning Knowledge Society prizes for their outstanding educational activities. I believe these prizes are evidence of the contribution by the entire Agency to promoting advanced approaches and views, and to uniting around common values a large community of people that are ready to see changes and get involved in developing their cities, regions and the entire country. It was important to carry out this work. It is being carried out now as well, as I see from the projects that we reviewed, and is focused on uniting people who are passionate about a particular cause. These people are entrepreneurs, researchers, people from the non-profit sector and creative industries and, of course, young people. I have no doubt that during this new, equally dazzling and effective stage of the Agency's future development, its key mission, which is to engage citizens in achieving our national development goals, should remain unchanged. It is imperative to help them realise their ideas and initiatives. Now, as we know, the Agency has over 4.5 million like-minded partners in Russia. I know that in three years the Agency plans to more than double this community to 10 million people. This is already a large""army."" Most importantly, these should not be perfunctory numbers or some kind of indicators, but a really powerful community, a force made of energetic people capable of making a meaningful contribution to the general national agenda. In this regard, I would like to note that with the participation of VEB– I see the head of VEB on one of these screens– a comprehensive mechanism for implementing civil projects will be created, and the Powerful Ideas for New Times forum will become a permanent platform for collecting meaningful and constructive proposals. By the way, I propose holding this forum in the first quarter of 2022. Next, and I already mentioned this, we had a chance to see at the exhibition how the digital platform, which brings together best regional practices, works. They have proven effective in helping people resolve everyday problems. I want the relevant State Council commissions to team up with the Agency and build an effective system for spreading the management teams' experience locally. During our tour of the projects, we heard many requests to ask the Government, to instruct the Government, to develop in conjunction with the Government– in a word, it is necessary to include the most important decisions in national projects and state programmes, including in the sphere of infrastructure improvements.(Addressing General Director of the Agency for Strategic Initiatives Svetlana Chupsheva.) I hope, Svetlana, that you and I will not forget the words the young people said at the exhibition, and their proposals will need to be summarised and properly drafted in the form of instructions. Of course, it is important to share your best practices and be open to new ideas. Again, I am saying this to the Agency. It is important to form teams and bring onboard like-minded people from our country and other countries as well. I see that this work is underway, which is good I know that Boiling Point is already underway in Kazakhstan. I would like to hear from you about other plans to expand international cooperation and projects at the global level, because this entails access to the markets of third countries, which invariably increases the competitive environment, which means that ultimately it will increase competitiveness as well. A whole ecosystem, as they say now, has formed around the Agency, which brings together initiatives in the social sphere, nature conservation, personnel training, and the development of advanced technology. Here is what I would like to emphasise. All our state work and the Agency's work should, of course, revolve around people and their well-being. We have just reviewed a project which does exactly that: it puts in the centre the individual with their interests, requests, plans, etc. Of course, in fact, every project should be lined up this way. These goals should be linked together and run across all programmes and projects. The Agency must concentrate on its activities in the regions, help local management teams achieve visible changes at schools, outpatient clinics, hospitals, social protection institutions, and to take into account the residents' requests and suggestions. As a matter of fact, this is how things are, and I hope not only on paper, but in real life as well. By the way, much depends on the Government here. We have just now talked about free school meals and so on, and also about amendments to the current legislation. We will need to work on this later. I also expect the ASI to make a substantial contribution to the establishment of the Federation of New Development Centres in the regions, the development of a modern urban environment and the promotion of national technologies and the so-called green technology, the environmentally friendly solutions in energy and construction, including within the framework of your new system-wide project, the National Environmental Initiative. In this context I would like to point out(I see that members of the Presidential Executive Office and Government ministers are attending this meeting) that our colleagues who presented their projects have asked us to amend the law to add industrial waste, including construction waste, to the regions' competence, because they would be unable to regulate these activities otherwise. There is much to do in that sphere, and the regions are ready to do it, whereas now they are only responsible for general waste. They have no control over construction waste, and so they cannot address the issue quickly or properly. I see that the Economic Development Minister is taking notes. I would like to thank him and to express the hope that we will follow this issue to its logical end. As we agreed, we will keep an eye on the indicators of the national quality of life rating. The ASI initiative on assessing the integral results and the regional teams' efforts to improve the quality of life is very important and we must support it. During the St Petersburg International Economic Forum last summer, we discussed the first tentative results of this project. Today we will take a look at the situation in individual regions based on the analysis of the available data. Next, one of the Agency's major tasks is to help people in all age groups to find their place in the changing technological world. The main thing here is to ensure that learning new skills and competencies increases the people's real income. It is in accordance with this logic that the Agency should launch convenient learning formats, including for those who would like to start a business or work for themselves in the positive sense, that is, become independently employed. I would also like to tell the Agency's Youth Initiatives Centre that it should continue working to create a comprehensive modern environment for the development of children's, youth, business and technology teams, especially considering that we know examples when teenagers, very young people indeed, want to run a business and start very successful businesses. There are some wonderful start-ups. Their goal for the first ten years of operation is not only to succeed in the national market but also to take their projects to international markets. And lastly, another important goal is to work together with like-minded organisations to analyse and forecast the development of technologies and social projects and processes in the next 20–30 years and possibly in a longer term. This is very important for properly organising their own operation. This vision of the future has a huge, applied importance already at the current stage in this rapidly changing world. It helps set the guidelines, reconsider some things, promptly respond to arising challenges and look at the current stage from a different perspective. It is a crucial job, including in terms of education. It is extremely important, and I am sure that the country and society need it. Let us get down to the issues on our agenda today. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67374,Press statements following Russian-Mongolian talks,2021-12-16T16:40:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin and Ukhnaagiin Khurelsukh made statements for the press on the results of the Russian-Mongolian talks.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. We are delighted to welcome the President of Mongolia to Moscow. After being sworn in as head of state, Mr President is paying his first foreign visit precisely to Russia, and this, of course, shows that Mongolia attaches great significance to developing neighbourly ties with Russia. Certainly, we are also interested in maintaining a close partnership with our Mongolian friends. Mutually beneficial cooperation between both states has a long history. This year marked the 100th anniversary of the establishment of official diplomatic relations. I would like to recall that Russia became the first country to recognise the independence of the Mongolian state. Since then, Russian-Mongolian interaction has grown stronger and expanded, hinged on the principles of respect and consideration for each other's interests. The people of Russia and Mongolia remember their war-time friendship, which Mr President has mentioned today and which was consolidated in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol and during World War II. Today's talks were held in a business-like and constructive manner. Mr President and I adopted the joint Political Declaration that builds upon the Treaty on Friendly Relations and Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, signed in 2019. And, most importantly, the Declaration sets forth clear guidelines for further deepening bilateral ties in various spheres of cooperation. Apart from that, both parties have drafted and will sign during this visit a package of intergovernmental and interdepartmental documents covering many aspects of our interaction and cooperation, including the economy and trade. Russia is one of Mongolia's largest foreign trade partners. Despite the difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, mutual trade increased by 24 percent in the first nine months of 2021. The Russian-Mongolian Intergovernmental Commission on Cooperation in Trade, Economy, Science and Technology is working effectively. This past November, Ulan Bator was the venue for its latest meeting, and the participants charted new specific plans for interaction in such fields as infrastructure, ore mining industry, power industry, agriculture, and digital technologies. The Ulaanbaatar Railway is our flagship and quite successful joint commercial project. Over the past decade, the bilateral freight volume on this system has doubled from 15 to 30 million tonnes annually. In recent years, Russia has supported a large amount of work to modernise and expand the Mongolian carrier's rail lines as well as to strengthen its financial stability. In particular, a regular indexation of transport fees has been established, a debt-restructuring plan has been drawn up with regard to old loans from the 1990s, and a number of long-standing land issues have been resolved. We hope that all these steps will make rail transport across Mongolia more attractive and profitable. Mr Khurelsukh and I have substantively discussed our energy cooperation. Russia is a reliable supplier of energy resources to Mongolia, providing about 80 percent of the country's demand for petroleum products. Russian energy companies are interested in working in the Mongolian market for fuels and lubricants and expanding their presence. In particular, Rosneft is now being registered as an operator of bulk fuel installations at the new international airport in Ulan Bator. A project to build a Russia-China gas pipeline across Mongolia is under consideration. The discussion is progressing steadily. The new pipeline could be a branch of Russia's Power of Siberia 2 pipeline. We have identified the best route, length and other parameters, and a feasibility study is underway. I think it will be available in the next few weeks. Russia and Mongolia have gained solid experience in cooperating on electrical power engineering. Last year, our companies ROTEC and Ural Turbine Works completed the modernisation of the CHPP-4 thermal power plant in Ulan Bator. The upgrade increased the Mongolian national energy system's capacity by 15 percent. Another joint project to modernise CHPP-3 is under consideration. Good prospects are opening up for nuclear energy cooperation. Rosatom is exploring the possibility of building a Nuclear Science Centre in Mongolia which would be used to research the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in various sectors of the Mongolian economy, including industry, medicine, and agriculture. Russia and Mongolia plan to continue to jointly pursue important environmental projects, which the President and I discussed in depth today. In particular, we will cooperate to preserve our cross-border rivers, including the Selenga and the Uldza, which form the unique ecosystems of Lake Baikal and Torey Lakes, both UNESCO World Heritage Sites. I would like to emphasise that Russia and Mongolia have partnered in fighting the coronavirus infection. We have organised deliveries to Mongolia of our Sputnik V vaccine and test systems for detecting COVID-19. In addition, there are two Russian mobile laboratories working in Mongolia to identify dangerous viruses. During the talks, we touched on the topic of humanitarian cooperation. We agreed to step up scientific, cultural and sports exchanges, and to continue the practice of regularly holding Russian-Mongolian Friendship Days and Days of Culture. Russia provides assistance in training highly qualified specialists for all sectors of the Mongolian economy. Mongolian students are allocated 500 budget-funded places a year at our universities. We are satisfied with the fact that Mongolia has a well-established system for studying the Russian language. I would like to note that Russia and Mongolia are successfully cooperating in defence and security, contacts between law enforcement agencies are getting stronger, and joint military exercises are held on a regular basis. In particular, within the framework of the annual Selenga exercises, joint tactical methods of fighting illegal armed groups are being practiced. Russia and Mongolia's positions on pressing regional and international problems overlap or are very close. Our countries coordinate their actions at the UN. The possibility of including our Mongolian partners in the EAEU integration processes is being studied. A joint research group has been formed, which is studying the feasibility of creating a free trade zone between Mongolia and the EAEU. Ladies and gentlemen, The visit of the President of Mongolia continues, and he has an extensive programme which includes a meeting with the Prime Minister, the heads of both chambers of the Federal Assembly, and a meeting at the Security Council. With this in mind, we can be confident that President Khurelsukh's visit will be successful and, without a doubt, productive. We have covered practically all aspects of our interaction. I am confident that the agreements to be reached will lead to expanding the comprehensive development of the Russian-Mongolian partnership. Once again, I would like to thank the President for making his first state visit to the Russian Federation. Thank you. President of Mongolia Ukhnaagiin Khurelsukh Khurelsukh UkhnaagiinPresident of Mongolia(retranslated): I am happy that my first foreign visit is to the Russian Federation. It is timed to the 100th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Mongolia and Russia. This visit is of historical significance. During the talks with Mr Putin, we summed up the development of relations over the past century, exchanged in detail our views on further goals and areas of cooperation and on major joint projects, and mapped out prospects for joint actions for the next century. Both leaders noted with pride our good tradition of mutual assistance, which took shape during the struggle for freedom and independence, in the years of the Great Patriotic War, during peaceful development. We also expressed our intention to develop political dialogue in accordance with principles of equality and respect for territorial integrity and international law. Close friendly cooperation over 100 years is a rare historical precedent. Our relations are a model of historical relations. During President Putin's visit to Mongolia in 2019, we signed a Treaty of Friendly Relations and Comprehensive Strategic Partnership for an indefinite term. Both leaders confirmed that it had become a foundation for enriching our comprehensive strategic partnership with new content and for its intensive development. We have opportunities to develop cooperation in energy, supplies of fuel and lubricants, natural gas, in road and transport sector, communications, infrastructure, agriculture, environmental protection and other areas of trade and economic cooperation. We consider it necessary to substantially expand our trade, economic and investment cooperation and raise it to a new level. During the visit, our country expressed its desire to develop intensive mutually beneficial cooperation. We invited our Russian partners to take part in infrastructure, railway, energy and other projects. We exchanged views on upgrading the checkpoints on our state border, increasing their throughput capacity and creating a cross-border zone of bilateral cooperation. We plan to cooperate on the Mongolia-Russia-China economic corridor project, which was approved in 2016, and we are also satisfied with the successful implementation of the trilateral project for the construction of a gas pipeline from Russia to China through Mongolia. In order to develop transport connections between Asia and Europe, as well as to fulfil Mongolia's national goal, Transit Mongolia, we exchanged views on stepping up cooperation to increase the economic efficiency of the joint Mongolian-Russian company Ulaanbaatar Railway, upgrading its infrastructure and creating new railway, motorway and energy corridors. Our two countries have a strong tradition of cooperation in humanitarian sphere, in culture, education and scientific research. We are grateful for the Russian Federation's decision to increase the number of Government grants for Mongolian students. Our countries closely cooperate within regional associations and international organisations and have confirmed plans to coordinate their efforts at the UN, ASEAN, and the SCO. We support the initiative of the Greater Eurasian Partnership put forward by President Putin, and we are willing to cooperate to implement joint projects to develop trade, economic and infrastructure related interaction. During the visit, at the invitation of President Vladimir Putin, we approved a joint declaration on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Mongolia and Russia. Important documents on cooperation in the area of checkpoints and customs offices' operation, as well as in the sphere of intellectual property, education and culture, were signed as well. Our relations are moving forward despite the pandemic. We are in favour of overcoming the pandemic as soon as possible, restoring the spirit of cooperation and bringing it to a new level. I am pleased with the results of my visit. On behalf of the Mongolian people, I would like to express gratitude to you, Mr President, and to our eternal neighbour, the great Russian people, for the efforts to promote traditionally friendly cooperation, and I wish you all the best. Thank you."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67373,Talks with President of Mongolia Ukhnaagiin Khurelsukh,2021-12-16T14:50:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow","Vladimir Putin held talks in the Kremlin with President of Mongolia Ukhnaagiin Khurelsukh, who has come to Russia on a working visit.","After a conversation in restricted format, the talks continued in the working breakfast format. Following international consultations, the presidents of the two countries made statements for the press. In addition, a Joint Declaration was adopted on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Russia and Mongolia.*** Beginning of talks with President of Mongolia Ukhnaagiin Khurelsukh President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, First of all, I would like to thank you for accepting the invitation to come to Russia. As far as I know, this is your first foreign visit since your election. It is a good sign. Your visit is taking place in the year of the 100th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries, which are based on the Treaty on Friendly Relations and Comprehensive Strategic Partnership that we signed several years ago. Moreover, our relations are developing in nearly all spheres, despite the pandemic, including the economy, political ties, in the area of military cooperation and on the international stage. I know that you have a very busy agenda during your trip to Russia. I am confident that your visit will be successful and will yield good results. Regarding the economy, our trade went down by 20 percent last year because of the pandemic, but in the first three quarters of this year it increased by approximately 25 percent. There are reasons to believe that we will return to the pre-pandemic level and that we can surpass it. Mr President, I am delighted to see you. Welcome. President of Mongolia Ukhnaagiin Khurelsukh Khurelsukh UkhnaagiinPresident of Mongolia(retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President. I am very happy that after the presidential election in Mongolia, my first visit abroad is to the Russian Federation. I also want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to organise my visit as part of celebrations of our historical anniversary, the 100th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Mongolia and Russia, despite the difficulties the pandemic continues to pose, unfortunately, all over the world. I believe that our relations are truly historical, remarkable and good. A hundred years ago, representatives of our country arrived in Moscow, and we fought together for the independence of our country and sovereignty. During the hard years of war and in the post-war times, our peoples worked together and wrote this great history. They did so during the Battles on the Khalkhin Gol in 1939, and during the Great Patriotic War. As you know, we have great respect for the historical role Russia played during those times. We believe that Russia played an important role in global security and in the victory over Nazism. This is why we highly respect the Great Victory holiday. Over the past years, we have had a rich history together. We cooperated closely with the Soviet people in the Virgin Lands campaign and in the construction of large industrial facilities; we even went into space together. At the moment, we do not have any political disagreements and have had truly brotherly relations for the past 100 years. The Mongolian people feel that our friendship and comradeship are an example of good relations not only in our region, but in the world in general. Prior to my visit, we had several important meetings, in particular, with deputy prime ministers Alexei Overchuk and Viktoria Abramchenko. A regular meeting of the intergovernmental commission was held. The Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces also visited our country. Many economic issues were dealt with before my visit to Russia. We believe the time has come for us to talk about new undertakings in our relations. I would also like to stress that during the years of your work as President and Prime Minister, relations between our countries have been actively developing. You have visited our country four times. The Mongolian people and our country as a whole have very friendly feelings, respectively, for the Russian people and for you personally. There is one question though about promoting trade and economic relations between our countries. When I took office as President, I set myself the goal of implementing the Transit Mongolia national project. I believe that, as part of this project, coordination with the initiative you mentioned– the creation of the Greater Eurasian Partnership– is also very important. We strongly support this initiative. We live in a region that connects Asia with Europe and Russia with China. The Mongolian-Russian border is over 3,500 kilometres long, and our border with China is 4,700 kilometres. We are also closely following relations between our two great neighbours, Russia and China. Yesterday, you had a meeting with the head of the People's Republic of China[Xi Jinping], and we are observing your cooperation with great interest, and I think the whole world also pays great attention to it. That is why we are putting forward the initiative to promote the Transit Mongolia programme, since the shortest route connecting Europe with Asia and Russia with China passes through our territory. Our plans include the construction of two railways– eastern and western– which run through the eastern and western parts of our country. On the eastern side, this railway connects China with the Trans-Baikal Territory and goes to Far Eastern ports. And in the western direction, this railway continues the Kyzyl-Kuragino Railway and goes further across our territory to China. We also have a question about upgrading the central railway corridor that runs through Irkutsk. We are very pleased with the results of the project to build a gas pipeline from Russia to China across Mongolia. In 2019, as Prime Minister, when I was in the Russian Federation on a visit, you and I, Mr President, initiated this project. I am very pleased that this project is a success. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67366,Meeting of the Council for Strategic Development and National Projects,2021-12-15T16:35:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region",Vladimir Putin held a videoconference meeting of the Presidential Council for Strategic Development and National Projects.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, good afternoon. As is traditional, the Council for Strategic Development and National Projects is meeting at the end of the year to review this year's performance and discuss the details of what has been done to achieve the national goals– as a reminder, those are the main benchmarks for the country's development through to 2030. I would like to note that, despite the unfavourable epidemiological situation, Russia has never stopped working on its national projects. Moreover, some of the indicators show that the dynamics and intensity have been, if anything, growing. Consider that in 2019, the first year of implementing these projects, cash spending on them was lagging behind– not much, but nevertheless– lagging compared to the execution of the general federal budget, but now these indicators have levelled off. For reference, as of December 1, 2019, 78 percent of the federal budget was implemented, and spending on national projects accounted for 70 percent of the plan. As of December 1, 2021, 80 percent of spending on both the federal budget and national projects was executed. Of course, for all the importance of budgetary discipline, using the funds intensively and sticking to the plan is not the only thing that matters– this, as we understand it, is just a tool for attaining the goal, and naturally, it should be made good use of. What matters most– and I will stress this again– are the results that have been achieved, how specific they are, how tangible and visible to people, how they affect the development of Russian regions and all territories across the country. I am pleased to note that some results have been achieved. There are shortcomings as well– we will talk about them too, but we have seen results. I would like to note that the annual plan for the repair of the road network in urban complexes has been carried out; such conurbations are home to about a half of Russia's citizens. Overall, the relocation of people from dilapidated housing is proceeding ahead of schedule. In 10 months of 2021, 120,000 people moved to new modern apartments– as many as over the whole course of the two previous years. Allow me to remind you that we will launch a new relocation programme very soon, in January 2022, which will embrace buildings that were recognised as dilapidated as of January 1, 2021. The money to finance the programme over the next two years, 45 billion rubles, has been included in the federal budget. As for preschool education, some 180,000 places have been created at nurseries over the past few years. The queue for places at nurseries throughout the country has been halved, and the problem has been resolved completely in 31 regions. Virtually every family with children under three years can send their kids to a nursery there, if they want to. However, there are not enough nursery places in several regions, where 73,500 kids are waiting for a place. This is just for your information. It is clear that we will eventually resolve this problem in accordance with our plans. Free hot meals are provided to over 7 million primary school pupils. This is part of our systemwide efforts to support families with children. At present, targeted state assistance is provided to Russian families with some 7 million children. As I mentioned, our task for the next few years is to create a comprehensive system of assistance for families with children from birth to school graduation. It should be said that some 800,000 people in difficult circumstances receive support under a social contract. The fight against poverty is a clear priority. We regularly discuss this issue, which is directly connected to our response to the demographic challenge. Everything is important for increasing people's incomes, including targeted social support, assistance for families with children, new jobs, which is a key element, balanced development of the regions and economic sectors, as well as improving the affordability and quality of education at all levels, which I have already mentioned. We will accelerate the construction of new schools. Over the past three years, 271 schools for 177,000 pupils have been built in 78 regions. I would like to remind you that we plan to build another 1,300 schools by the end of 2024. In addition to this, in the next five years we will implement an ambitious programme of capital repairs and technical upgrades at existing schools, which will cover 7,300 buildings. As for the teaching staff, over 800,000 schoolteachers and 100,000 advisors at vocational and technical schools will receive additional payment for class supervision and guidance. The work of classroom teachers and advisors is extremely important for educating our young people, for their personal and professional development and hence for the future of Russia. The healthcare infrastructure is being upgraded. Since 2018, 1,750 paramedic centres and outpatient clinics have been put into service. The regions have received over 1,000 mobile medical complexes. As a result, the amount of medical assistance in rural areas has doubled. Children's outpatient clinics, oncological and cardio-vascular centres are being refurbished. Over 40,000 units of new medical equipment have been supplied to them under national projects. I would like to add that over 350 outpatient oncological aid centres have been opened in the regions, while local patients prone to cardio-vascular diseases have been entitled to free medication since last year. This year about 600,000 people receive them. I would like to add that national projects have produced one more result that is important for enhancing living standards in Russian cities, notably, the improvement of ecological well-being. We have set ourselves the task of eliminating 88 of the most dangerous facilities that have produced cumulative environmental damage by 2024. Sixty facilities of this kind have already been shut down and another six will be removed by the end of the year. Thirty unauthorised dumping sites within city limits have been also shut or recultivated. Another 12 must be removed by the end of the year. I would like to emphasise that national projects are very important for Russian people. They should help enhance the welfare of Russian families, improve the urban environment, social sphere, and create new opportunities for businesses. That said, it is very important to hear what people think about the changes brought about by national projects. We know that not everything is as smooth here as we would like it to be, as I said at the beginning of my speech. Unfortunately, problems do not go away. I will repeat that the goal of every national project is not just to build a certain facility, put it into service or repair. We must learn to make national projects resolve people's most sensitive issues. This is the main criterion of the effectiveness of our common performance. The participants need to be involved in national projects, and they need to act responsibly and in earnest on a daily basis at the federal and regional levels. I urge our colleagues to constantly monitor the status of national projects and to analyse bottlenecks or failures to keep up with the schedule in order to be able to make additional decisions based on an objective situation, taking into account arising problems and difficulties. So, this year, rising prices have become a major challenge in implementing national projects. Prices went up for a wide range of products, including construction materials. Faced with higher prices, governors and regional leaders are increasingly reporting failed competitive bidding, construction delays and problems with contractors. I am not going to give you reference data regarding higher prices for reinforcement steel, sheet steel, bitumen and so on. You are well aware of them. These risks must be reduced as much as possible, better yet, nullified. The projects and sites planned under national projects must be completed. I would like to emphasise again that we are talking not about the amounts of allocated or used funds, but about newly built kindergartens, schools and infrastructure facilities, renovated hospitals and paramedic centres, phased-out landfills, and the like. The Government needs to prepare a clear-cut algorithm for actions regarding the federal and regional facilities under construction. Everyone participating in this work must understand what they need to do, and how this process will be funded. Also, at one time, we had lively discussions concerning the proportionate participation of the federal and the regional budgets in funding national projects. As a result, specific agreements were reached, and it is important for these agreements to be strictly implemented by all participants in the current difficult circumstances. This is what I wanted to say at the outset. Let us get to work. We will then sum up our discussion, draw certain conclusions, and outline the next steps for the next year and in the longer term. <…> Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, a few words in conclusion. First, I want to thank all of you. Yes, we spoke about problems, but overall work is underway in a consistent manner and at a good pace. The decisions and approaches that we discussed today– I just spoke about them in respect to a specific area– are of special importance for our country and our citizens. I am talking about national projects, the main tool for achieving the national development goals. We have done a lot already to implement these plans, and they are quite ambitious. This is obvious. It is important to reinforce and continue positive trends in the economy, social sphere, in solving environmental problems and improving the quality of life of our citizens in order to reach real, more tangible and substantial results for each family in Russia, and for the country in general. While implementing national projects, we are addressing complex tasks; there are difficulties and problem areas. Colleagues from the State Council commission, the Council's working group for National Projects and the Russian Popular Front spoke about them; the chairman of the executive committee just spoke about them. I ask the Government to monitor the problem areas and include them in the agenda for the first half of 2022. I also suggest we regularly review the implementation of national projects at meetings of the Council for Strategic Development presidium and hold reviews of project documents mostly in the in-person format with an open and detailed discussion. While summarising the results of our meeting, I would like to go back to several issues. As for construction. Mr Khusnullin suggested a detailed plan of action that would ensure the implementation of construction plans both at the federal and regional levels. It is crucially important that it covers the budget for the next three years, which means it will provide the necessary planning horizon and predictability for the regions and contractors. I support these initiatives and ask the Government to adopt decisions for their implementation in the near future. At the same time, I repeat that the Government is directly responsible for the completion of the construction of not only federal, but also regional projects. There is no need to wait and blame our colleagues in the regions for not having finished something or done it at the wrong time. Help them, please. It is necessary to put their facilities into operation as scheduled. This is what we agreed on when we launched the national project. Also, some colleagues mentioned earlier that the actual co-financing of national projects by the regions differs from the planned arrangements. We all understand that this is caused by higher prices. It is also obvious that the outline of work in each area and the list of objects are not always clearly defined. I ask the Government, together with the State Council commissions, to eliminate this so that all the co-financing agreements get fulfilled. Now, about modernising primary healthcare. We must not lower the bar that we have set ourselves in terms of modernising healthcare infrastructure. This means that the spending in this area should be adjusted for inflation. The pandemic has taken a heavy toll on public health around the world. Unfortunately, we are not an exception. In our country, it superimposed on the objective demographic trough. I think the right thing to do in the next two years will be to seriously step up work to strengthen primary healthcare. There is nothing unusual about it– these are our plans, which we have agreed upon long ago. According to experts, we will shift the main costs involved in solving this problem a little to the left. I understand that many things have been arranged and determined, it is very difficult to do this but please work on this, so as not to wait for future budget periods, and invest already now in the business, in creating and re-equipping healthcare facilities and in building up their capabilities. At the same time, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the issue is about protecting people's health– we understand very well what this is about. And the level of people's satisfaction with the quality and availability of medical care is the main integral indicator of our work's effectiveness, and here we need to achieve the greatest progress. So far, this figure has been quite modest, as you are aware. Nevertheless, I want to end with where I started: work is underway, and the pace is good. Once again, I thank all the participants in our meeting today and, of course, I wish you and your colleagues success and a happy New Year. Thank you. All the best."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67364,Talks with President of China Xi Jinping,2021-12-15T11:20:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region","Vladimir Putin held talks, via videoconference, with President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping.","Beginning of Russia-China talks President of Russia Vladimir Putin: President Xi, my dear friend, I am delighted to see you. Greetings. I am happy to have this opportunity to see you via videoconference. This allows us to hold in-depth discussions on the development of Russian-Chinese relations of comprehensive partnership and strategic interaction. I regard these relations as a shining example of interstate cooperation in the 21st century. We have maintained contact despite the sanitary and epidemiological restrictions, and in May[2021] we launched, via videoconference, the joint construction of four new power units for a nuclear power plant in China. In June, we held a videoconference on the 20th anniversary of the major Russia-China Treaty[on Good-Neighbourliness and Friendly Cooperation]. We also had telephone conversations about urgent international issues, in particular, the Afghan problem. This year Russia-China relations have been dominated by the 20th anniversary of the Treaty on Good-Neighbourliness and Friendly Cooperation. It has been extended for another five years. The consistent implementation of this fundamental document, which comprehensively reflects the deep historical traditions of friendship and mutual understanding between the Russian and Chinese people, has helped us to take our relations to an unprecedentedly high level. A new model of cooperation has developed between our countries, a model based, in part, on the principles of non-interference in each other's affairs and mutual resolve to turn our common border into a belt of eternal peace and good-neighbourliness. We are strengthening our trade and economic ties: from January to November this year, our mutual trade has increased by 31 percent to US$123 billion. We have beaten the record of the pre-pandemic year, 2019. In the near term, as agreed, we will pass the US$200 billion mark. We are implementing a number of large-scale joint projects in energy, including nuclear generation, industry and high technology. From the very beginning of the pandemic, we have firmly joined forces in responding to the coronavirus infection. China has become an international centre for the production of the Russian vaccines Sputnik V and Sputnik Light. Contracts for more than 150 million doses have been signed with six Chinese manufacturers. The multifaceted dialogue mechanism between the two countries' governments and relevant agencies is working smoothly, and parliamentary cooperation is strengthening. The foreign policy and defence departments maintain ongoing contact. Russia and China's close coordination in the world arena, and their responsible joint approach to current global problems have become a significant factor of stability in international relations. We are active on platforms such as the UN Security Council, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the BRICS. We are both contributing to the formation of a just world order based on international law. President Xi Jinping, my friend, I do hope that next February, we will finally be able to meet in person in Beijing. As we agreed, you and I will talk, and then we will participate in the Winter Olympics opening ceremony. Thank you for the invitation to attend this important event. I would like to note that we invariably support each other in every aspect of international sports cooperation, including in condemning any attempts to politicise sports and the Olympic movement. I have no doubt that the upcoming Winter Games will be held at the highest level. They know how to do things in China. By the way, to follow up on this high-profile sporting event, we plan to announce that 2022 and 2023 will be the Russian and Chinese years of cooperation in physical education and sports. In a word, given the grand scale of interaction between our countries, we have a wide range of important matters to discuss today. And of course, I would like to take this opportunity to wish you and all our Chinese friends a Happy New Year, wish you happiness, good health and all the very best. Thank you. President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping(retranslated): President Putin, my old friend, I am very happy that this is our second videoconference with you this year and our 37th meeting since 2013. At various recent events, you have always expressed a high opinion of China-Russia relations, describing them as an example of interstate ties in the 21st century, firmly supporting China's actions to protect its key national interests and resolutely opposing the attempts to drive a wedge between our countries. I appreciate this very much. I am ready to review with you the results of our relations this year and to map out plans for strengthening our cooperation in various spheres in the interests of the sustainable and high-quality development of our bilateral relations. The ongoing deep changes in international relations are closely interconnected with the spreading pandemic. The world has entered a period of turbulence and big changes. China-Russia relations have weathered many different trials, proved their viability and found a new lease of life. Standing at the helm of China-Russia relations, you and I have maintained close contacts on the main current issues. Our countries have officially announced the extension of the Treaty on Good-Neighbourliness and Friendly Cooperation, adding new substance to it, in keeping with the spirit of the times. China and Russia are firmly supporting each other on matters concerning the other side's vital interests and are protecting their national dignity and common interests. Our bilateral cooperation has shown that it has major political advantages and possibilities. For the first time ever, our trade in the first nine months of the year exceeded US$100 billion. As you have pointed out, it reached US$123 billion in November. The Year of Scientific and Technological Innovation was a success. We are implementing several large strategic projects. We are promoting the use of national currencies in mutual settlements, streamlining the structure of our investment cooperation, and boosting the aligned development[of the Silk Road Economic Belt] and the EAEU. Our countries are acting as responsible powers should. They are advocating a unifying international agenda against the pandemic and upholding the true essence of democracy and human rights, which makes them a real stronghold of multilateralism and a defender of international justice and equality. Next year we will hold the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of China, which is a big event for our country. And Russia will enter the main phase of its development programme through to 2030. Our countries should exchange and share the opportunity to openly promote the implementation of the global development agenda, thereby setting an example of a new type of international relations and the community, of a common destiny for humanity. I hope that you will visit China and will also attend the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics. I look forward to our""Olympic"" meeting. I am ready to move forward together with you and to jointly open a new page in China-Russia relations in the post-pandemic period. Thank you. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67361,Meeting with Government members,2021-12-14T17:40:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region",Vladimir Putin chaired a meeting with members of the Government via videoconference.,"Taking part in the meeting were Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Anton Vaino and his First Deputy Sergei Kiriyenko, First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov, Deputy Prime Ministers Viktoria Abramchenko, Yury Borisov, Tatyana Golikova, Alexander Novak, Alexei Overchuk, Marat Khusnullin and Dmitry Chernyshenko, Deputy Prime Minister – Chief of the Government Staff Dmitry Grigorenko, Deputy Prime Minister – Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoy to the Far Eastern Federal District Yury Trutnev, Presidential Aide Maxim Oreshkin, Minister of Economic Development Maxim Reshetnikov and Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov. First Deputy Speaker of the Federation Council Andrei Turchak, a number of ministers and federal agency heads, and President of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Alexander Shokhin were also invited to attend. A number of current issues were discussed during the meeting. In particular, Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova provided an update on the coronavirus and the plan for combatting the new omicron strain. First Deputy Speaker of the Federation Council Andrei Turchak and Minister of Transport Vitaly Savelyev reviewed the discussion of the draft law on introducing QR codes for transport. Minister of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media Maksut Shadayev discussed the new capabilities of the website Gossuslugi.Avto, while Minister of Culture Olga Lyubimova spoke about the development of municipal museums of regional history. Deputy Prime Minister Viktoria Abramchenko made the main report on implementing measures to reduce air pollution. President of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (RSPP) Alexander Shokhin and Energy Minister Nikolai Shulginov offered comments on this issue. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues, Let's get down to work. Today, Viktoria Abramchenko will give the main report on reducing air pollution and decreasing emissions. We will discuss this separately, in more detail. Now I would like to talk about a number of current issues. The first question is, of course, to Tatyana Golikova on the spread of omicron, a new coronavirus strain. Ms Golikova, what is happening with this in the country? Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova: Good afternoon, Mr President, colleagues. Mr President, with your permission I would like to give a very brief account of the current epidemiological situation, including the spread of the omicron strain, as you said. Following the 49th week – this past week – a 7.3 percent reduction in the disease rate has been recorded in Russia. However, the rate is still up in five regions: the Sakhalin Region, the Republic of Adygea, the Nenets Autonomous Area, the Kamchatka Territory and the Republic of Altai. An absence of any meaningful dynamic (decrease or increase) in the incidence rate has been recorded in 24 regions. The rate was down in 56 regions. However, this reduction is not sustainable: in retrospect, during the past four weeks we have seen either a reduction or an increase after each week. Last week, the number of regions where the disease rate was up, increased, whereas this week it is going down again. This is due to the fact that the number of daily cases is still quite high at about 30,000, and the omicron variant has already spread to 74 countries, as you mentioned. We see this from genomic sequencing data. As you are aware, Russia was impacted as well. We imported omicron with Russians returning from the Republic of South Africa and other countries. We took timely measures to stop it from spreading and isolated these people, with 177 of them now staying at observation facilities in the Moscow Region; 16 of them were found to have the omicron variant, which is almost 10 percent and indicates the fairly high contagiousness of this variant meaning that we need to extend restrictions with the New Year holiday approaching. Despite transport restrictions, cross-border travel was quite extensive, and our people will go on vacations soon to take advantage of the New Year holidays. Of course, we cannot rule out the possibility that this variant will continue to spread. According to international analysts, each person with the omicron variant in South Africa can infect 3 to 3.5 people. With the delta variant this figure was 0.8. So, we teamed up with researchers in order to continue to study the omicron variant. Of course, we will adjust our response measures depending on developments. (Then, Ms Golikova spoke in detail about the situation in healthcare, and the measures that have been taken and will be taken soon. The additional measures to respond to the spread of the novel coronavirus infection and the omicron variant include four blocks. The first block is the creation of barriers to slow the pace of COVID-19 spreading, including restrictions on the entry to Russia of foreign nationals from RSA and a number of other countries affected by omicron. It was also recommended that the regions strengthen oversight over compliance with restrictive measures and sanitary requirements in crowded places during the upcoming holidays. The second block includes timely prevention, including improving the efficiency of test systems for the diagnosing and early detection of the coronavirus. The third block includes deploying extra health workers and allocating funds for one-time insurance and dedicated social payments to medical workers who engage in fighting the coronavirus infection. And, finally, the mandatory health insurance system will receive full advance funding to ensure the uninterrupted provision of medical care in January.) As for herd immunity, it now stands at 56.1 percent. About 75.8 million people have received the first dose of the vaccine and 69.4 million have had two jabs. Mr President, we continue working on measures and adjusting them based on our monitoring of the situation. And we will continue to update you on this issue, and would like to ask you to support these measures. Thank you for your attention. Vladimir Putin: Good. Thank you very much. Ms Golikova, this year we provided medical and social workers with special payments during the 2021 New Year holidays. Those who worked and continue working with COVID patients received double pay. I would like to ask the Government to do the same for the New Year holidays in 2022. Tatyana Golikova: All right, we will do this, Mr President. Vladimir Putin: Yes, because the situation now is probably not as alarming as it was in January this year, but it is still complicated and people are working under a heavy load. Mr Siluanov, can we do this? Finance Minister Anton Siluanov: Yes. Mr President, according to our estimates, this will cost us a bit more than 8 billion rubles. We will find these funds in the budget. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Now there is one more issue related to this. I am referring to a draft law on introducing QR codes for transport. I know that the Duma is reviewing this bill. Mr Turchak. First Deputy Speaker of the Federation Council Andrei Turchak: Mr President. I would like to report to you that as soon as the Government submitted the relevant draft law on restrictions in transport, United Russia began a large-scale public discussion. Indeed, this draft is sensitive and affects the interests of a large number of our people. Of course, before adopting such decisions, it is necessary to consult those for whom we are actually working. Mr President, you have said absolutely correctly at a meeting of the Council for Civil Society and Human Rights that such rash decisions were absolutely unacceptable. United Russia used its regional resources to get feedback from the people. We have held 10 days of receptions, during which our governors, secretaries of our regional branches, senators and deputies at all levels met with people between December 1 and 10. We have received hundreds of thousands of requests, hundreds of thousands of questions. People asked reasonable questions, for example, how they should act in extraordinary situations. Anything can happen: people fall ill or, God forbid, die, emergencies happen, and people need to rush across the country. What should they do in such situations? Even today, when people take the first jab of the vaccine, they do not immediately receive a vaccination certificate. As a result of this work, the party has adopted a tough stand. It has been decided that our faction in the State Duma and the Committee on Transport should withdraw the draft law. Indeed, the draft law in its current form is not even ready for the first reading. At the same time, we understand perfectly well that the issue of passengers' safety and health is still on the agenda. Work will continue at the level of experts and, of course, the final decision will depend on the sanitary and epidemiologic situation. Thank you. (After that, Minister of Transport Vitaly Savelyev provided comments at the President's request. He reported that the decision to upgrade the draft law on the use of electronic certificates in transport had been adopted jointly with the State Duma so as to find a more comfortable routine for passengers, who should be able to use Russia's system of transportation in the current epidemiological situation. This decision has been taken to more closely examine at all the risks associated with the use of electronic certificates.) Vladimir Putin: Ms Golikova, how are these issues regulated in other countries? Tatyana Golikova: There are different methods, Mr President. Some countries use the so-called 2G regulations, allowing free movement only for vaccinated persons and those who have recovered from COVID-19 when cases are on the rise. Other countries also use the results of PCR tests. But the main thing is that these restrictions are usually temporary and are only used at a time when the number of cases increases significantly. When the rate goes down, these restrictions are generally loosened. Vladimir Putin: I see. But New Year celebrations are coming, and I believe that it would be rather difficult to impose such restrictions. We will create many problems for people. Alright, I see what you mean. Thank you. <…> Minister of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media Maksut Shadayev: Good afternoon, Mr President, colleagues, To begin, I would like to tell you that tomorrow, on December 15, it will be 12 years since we launched the unified public services portal. During this time, we have traversed a long road from a website where we published administrative regulations to a full digital ecosystem of electronic public services. Today, over 93 million Russian nationals have registered accounts on the portal. I would like to remind you that you can only register an account after receiving a passport. This is 75 percent of the population aged 14+. At the beginning of this year alone, the number of registered users on the portal has increased by 11 million people while the number of inquiries for services has doubled compared to the same period last year. Mr President, today almost 10 million people visit the portal every day, which is a big figure. The portal is now one of the ten most popular websites among Russian internet users. All this became possible owing to your instructions on the expedited digitalisation of public services and with support from Mr Mishustin, who keeps this issue under his personal control. He manually adjusts the work of any departments that might impede this process. Since the start of this year, we have converted over 170 federal, regional and municipal pubic, socially important services to electronic form and introduced a number of separate e-services: the Pushkin Card, the census, e-voting, and anti-COVID services. I will not list them all, but in November alone, we rendered 60 million services through the portal, which is three times more than in November last year. (Further the Minister described in detail e-services for car owners – on car registration, appointments for driving tests, and acquiring a driving license. This year alone, over 10 million people have used these services. This includes digital versions of legally important documents and the introduction of advanced digital formats for official paperwork like documents on traffic accidents.) <…> Minister of Culture Olga Lyubimova: Mr President, colleagues, There are over 1,500 local history museums in our country, of which 1,200 are operated by municipalities. They are developed at an uneven pace despite the fact that they have high educational capacity and boast unique knowledge of their respective local areas. Under your instructions, measures have been designated to support local history museums financially and by the professional community. A new document – a model standard for a municipal museum of local history – has been drafted as a result of efforts led by the Russian Ethnographic Museum. The purpose is to codify the activities of the institutions and to even out their development levels, to make them attractive for visitors, especially young people, and effective in terms of holding exhibitions and conducting research. The standard will improve museum-to-museum cooperation and make it much easier. It will also increase their audiences and improve accessibility by creating an enabling environment. I am sure that municipality tourist appeal will improve as well. The standards imply the availability of mandatory amenities at renovated museums, including specialised equipment, access to high-speed broadband internet, an accessible environment, internal navigation, a hospitality area, a conference space for get-togethers and educational events, audio guides, as well as attractive and informative museum websites. Infrastructure plays a decisive role in modernising museums. Over 400 museums in 73 constituent entities of the Russian Federation will be renovated and another 100 institutions upgraded over the next three years. Renovation of community cultural centres is another important area of focus. Over the past three years, we have built or upgraded 777 such centres, and there will be 950 of them by the end of the year. These new-format community cultural centres are outfitted with modern equipment and implements, as well as costumes for performances and shows. Opportunities are being created for people to engage in a wide variety of activities. For example, a children's film studio was set up at a community cultural centre in the Belgorod Region, and a social theatre project for children and adults with disabilities was launched in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Area. Over the next three years, we will allocate 6 billion rubles to build and repair over 300 rural community cultural centres. Mr President, municipal and local history museums and community cultural centres are being renovated with the funds that were made available upon your instructions through to 2024. However, these funds will also be used to create 600 model libraries, renovate five, repair 18 and equip 105 children's theatres, as well as to purchase 4 million books for regional libraries. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67362,Telephone conversation with President of France Emmanuel Macron,2021-12-14T16:40:00Z,NA,Vladimir Putin had a telephone conversation with President of the French Republic Emmanuel Macron. The conversation was initiated by the French side.,"Following an exchange of views about efforts to combat the spread of the coronavirus infection that are being undertaken in both countries, the presidents focused on current international affairs. With regard to the question on the situation on the Belarus-EU border raised by Emmanuel Macron, the President spoke in favour of discussing these problems during direct contacts between EU representatives and Minsk. The fact that Poland and the Baltic States are violating their international obligations to protect the rights of refugees and that the migration crisis needs to be overcome in accordance with humanitarian law was noted. Hope was expressed that the migrant-related problem on the border would be removed from the agenda soon. The sides presented their principled assessments of the current situation in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin provided specific examples of violations by Kiev of the Minsk agreements, which is the only viable path towards overcoming the internal Ukraine crisis. It was also noted that the Ukrainian authorities are purposefully aggravating the situation on the line of contact, and are doing so with the complicity of a number of Western countries. In addition, modern weapons are being pumped into Ukraine, which poses direct threat to Russia's security. The President emphasised the importance of immediately launching international talks to develop legally stated guarantees to forestall NATO's further eastward expansion and the deployment of weapons that threaten Russia in neighbouring states, primarily, Ukraine. This issue also came up during a recent videoconference with US President Joseph Biden. The President called on his French partners to be receptive to these concerns and to take part in discussing them. The state of affairs in the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement was reviewed in depth as well. Vladimir Putin briefed his counterpart on the trilateral meeting of the leaders of Russia, Azerbaijan and Armenia in Sochi on November 26, which was timed to coincide with the anniversary of the signing of the Statement on Nagorno-Karabakh on November 9, 2020. He updated his counterpart on the measures being taken locally to comply with the ceasefire, to have refugees return home, and to restore trade and economic links and transport service. Hope was expressed that the meeting of the heads of the EU bodies with Ilham Aliyev and Nikol Pashinyan scheduled for December 15 would also be useful. The expediency of stepping up the efforts of the OSCE Minsk Group with co-chairs (Russia, the United States, and France) was supported. The parties agreed to continue to maintain close personal contact."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67359,Telephone conversation with President of Finland Sauli Niinistö,2021-12-14T16:05:00Z,NA,Vladimir Putin had a telephone conversation with President of Finland Sauli Niinistö.,"The main attention was paid to the issues related to the Ukrainian domestic crisis. President of Russia Vladimir Putin told Sauli Niinist ö about the results of his talks with US President Joseph Biden via videoconference on December 7, 2021, and made principled assessments of the developments regarding Ukraine. He emphasised the importance of the complete and unconditional fulfilment by Kiev of the Minsk Package of Measures. The President of Russia noted, in part, that in violation of the Minsk agreements, the Ukrainian authorities are more and more obviously placing their bets on the use of force. Thus, they are using heavy weapons and attack drones in Donbass. In this context, Vladimir Putin again stressed the importance of immediately starting talks with the United States and NATO. The goal of the talks would be to draft international legal security guarantees for Russia, ruling out NATO's further movement eastward and the deployment of weapons systems threatening Russia in Ukraine and other adjacent states. Vladimir Putin emphasised that this fully conformed to the principle of indivisible security sealed in the 1975 Helsinki Final Act and the 1999 Istanbul Charter. In this context, Vladimir Putin supported President Niinistö's initiative to convene a summit in 2025 in honour of the 50th anniversary of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. A number of current bilateral issues were discussed. The leaders reaffirmed their striving to continue developing mutually beneficial cooperation, including trade and the economy. In addition, emphasis was laid on further cooperation in regional affairs, including in the north and the Arctic. The leaders exchanged greetings in connection with the approaching New Year and Christmas holidays."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67352,Telephone conversation with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson,2021-12-13T19:05:00Z,NA,Vladimir Putin had a telephone conversation with Prime Minister of Great Britain Boris Johnson.,"Both leaders expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Glasgow under the United Kingdom's chairmanship. The Prime Minister noted the contribution that Russia had made to the conference, as well as the Action on Forests and Land Use. Like other Western leaders, Boris Johnson expressed concern about Russia's alleged large-scale troop movements near the Ukrainian border. In this regard, Vladimir Putin provided in-depth and principled assessments of the current situation in Ukraine. Specific examples of Kiev's destructive course on derailing the Minsk agreements, which are the only viable path towards resolving the internal Ukraine crisis, were given. It was also pointed out that the Ukrainian authorities are purposefully aggravating the situation on the line of contact and are using heavy weapons and attack drones, which are prohibited by the Minsk Package of Measures in the conflict zone. Ukraine's policy of discrimination against Russian-speaking people was pointed out as well. It was emphasised that all this is happening amid the active military ""exploration"" of Ukraine's territory by NATO, something that poses a direct threat to Russia's security. With this in mind, Vladimir Putin stated the need to immediately begin talks in order to develop clear international legal agreements that can preclude NATO's further eastward advance and the deployment of weapons that pose a threat to Russia in neighbouring states, primarily Ukraine. Russia will present draft documents to this end. The leaders agreed to continue to discuss the issues raised during the conversation through various channels."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67345,Meeting with Constitutional Court Chairman Valery Zorkin,2021-12-13T13:30:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region",Vladimir Putin had a meeting with Chairman of the Constitutional Court Valery Zorkin.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Zorkin, first of all let me congratulate you on Constitution Day. The Constitution is the foundation of the entire legal system of the state, and the role of the Constitutional Court here, as the supreme constitutional control body, is of everlasting importance. Moreover, the updated Constitution has strengthened the role of the Constitutional Court even more. Perhaps we will begin our talk with this, considering we have a good opportunity to congratulate each other during the meeting. Constitutional Court Chairman Valery Zorkin Zorkin ValeryConstitutional Court President: Thank you very much, Mr President. I would like to congratulate you, too, because we know that the Constitution contains the word""guarantor"" and the Constitutional Court, is still, I think, let me put like this, it is the guardian of the Constitution. If I may, as per tradition, for many years now I have been presenting our selected decisions to you on behalf of the judges– they all signed here. But, since this year is not over, it is like a follow-up to the past. Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much. Please pass my regards and greetings to your colleagues, too. Valery Zorkin: Everyone asked me to wish you good health and thank you for the greetings we have received. Vladimir Putin: Has the volume of work grown recently? Valery Zorkin: It depends. I would like to say that first of all, we are living under the sign of the updated Constitution, and this is the second year, which in fact imposes great obligations. Of course, we are trying to use the new provisions of the Constitution, for example, in the social sphere. It is very important. The number of complaints has not increased, but the number of rulings has remained approximately the same. Vladimir Putin: And the structure? Valery Zorkin: For the first time, since December 1 we have had 11 Constitutional judges, as per the Constitution; the number has gradually decreased and now it complies with the Constitution. These selected decisions will be in approximately the same proportion this year: there are more than 50 rulings that are the most important ones, and about 3,000 others are definitions. But I want to say what matters regarding all these decisions: after all, it is not the fate of just one citizen– Ivanov or Petrov– that is being decided, but every decision constitutes the fate of the law, whether it stays in force or not. If it remains, as interpreted by the Constitutional Court, then it is a great help to all legal practitioners. You were speaking about difficulties– the existing difficulties, for example. Laws have become more professional, this is obvious. Let us take, for example, the tax legislation. In the 1990s, as I recall, we well-nigh held a plenary meeting on taxes. Today, we have perhaps fewer[sittings] on taxes than on other matters, like, for example, social rights, criminal law and the criminal process, civil law, property, contracts, etc. This seems to testify to the fact that the tax legislation has stabilised, unlike social law, which is always a problem, of course. Legislators obviously have much to think about in this area. In general, however, I would like to say– I judge on the basis of the Constitutional Court's proceedings– that Russia's legislative system has become stable, balanced and more professional. Of course, there are always blemishes, the pabulum for the Constitutional Court. But I think that now we should lay greater emphasis on law enforcement, because we check not just the letter of the law but also take into consideration law enforcement practice. And that is where the trouble lies, as the saying goes. Certainly, law enforcement has become more professional as well, but today we are mostly focusing on how the law is working in practice. We take our decisions as a whole. Of course, given the major amendments that have been introduced, the Constitutional Court has to absorb[the new norms] and transmit this into its decisions. The situation is not easy, because there are still many complaints. But I would like to say that complaints themselves have become professional, along with laws and law enforcement. And this is not only because lawyers get involved in the process, but also because the Constitutional Court is in its fourth decade and at this stage people are obviously aware of what demands they can make on the Constitutional Court and what matters should be taken to their building-utilities administrator offices, or, say, to a general jurisdiction court, or their local police inspector. Previously, all this was very vague. While in the 1990s, about a half of 19,000 applications were about things that had nothing to do with us at all, today the whole thing is more professional. Vladimir Putin: This demonstrates people's greater knowledge of the law. Valery Zorkin: I think, yes, absolutely. The level of legal consciousness has risen, of course, and there are higher demands on us. We recently conducted a survey to monitor public feedback regarding our work. We, too, need to know about this; we receive various letters, and so on. Our analysts suggested the following concept: all segments of society responding to us should be called""telescopes,""""microscopes"" or""distorting mirrors."" A""telescope"" is quite clear: good things can be seen over a large distance.""Microscopes"" are people who have decided to delve into the details, etc. It is easy to understand what""distorting mirrors"" do. Nevertheless, I believe that the Constitutional Court can even benefit from these""distorting mirrors."" In reality, the human rights situation is not so simple. We understand that Russia is moving forward, that all this is gradually becoming more solid, and that people are becoming more competent. However, there is no denying the fact that violations do exist. Here is what I want to say about this third group. It may be surprising, but its members voice drastic opinions and sometimes speak straight from the shoulder, so to say. These people are lawyers accompanying those who file complaints, and they win from time to time. Therefore, one would like to ask the following question: What kind of a court? Does it exist or not? I believe that it does exist, and this is what I think. Vladimir Putin: Yes, of course. It is very good that people win. This means the more professional the rulings are, the more people will trust the entire judicial system. It is therefore very important. Valery Zorkin: Mr President, in this connection, I would like to say a few words about professionalism. Of course, we are not the only element of the judicial system, and there are also general jurisdiction courts. I would like to take this opportunity and, instead of set phrases, I would like to say that I am sincerely convinced that we maintain professional relations with the Supreme Court, in the first place. You see, people come to us only after they have been to the Supreme Court. I would like to note that our relations are quite professional. The Supreme Court respects our rulings. It would be possible to partially ignore some of these rulings, and we would engage in a tug-of-war in some cases. I have already noted this somewhere, and I have said that not all countries in transition have passed painlessly through this situation, there even were the so-called wars when it became necessary to… Vladimir Putin: Court wars, right? Valery Zorkin: Yes, legislators had to intervene and to decide whether the Constitutional Court's authority or the Supreme Court's authority should be trimmed or whether to merge the two courts. Vladimir Putin: We faced the same problems in relations between the Commercial Court and the Supreme Court. Valery Zorkin: I should say here that we maintain completely normal and business-like relations, and, by the way, the Constitution assists this process; all of its provisions are quite clear. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67334,Meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council,2021-12-10T13:45:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region",Vladimir Putin took part in a meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council via videoconference.,"Also taking part in the meeting were Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan, President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko, President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev and President of Kyrgyzstan Sadyr Japarov; heads of the EAEU observer states – President of Cuba Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez and President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev; Honorary Chairman of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council Nursultan Nazarbayev, Chairman of the Board of the Eurasian Economic Commission Mikhail Myasnikovich, Chairman of the Executive Committee and Executive Secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent States Sergei Lebedev, and Chairman of the Board of the Eurasian Development Bank Nikolai Podguzov. The participants adopted a package of documents following the meeting. In particular, they adopted agreements on the use of navigation seals to track shipments in the Eurasian Economic Union and on audit activities within the EAEU. A number of decisions were also taken, including on the formation of a free trade zone between the EAEU and the Islamic Republic of Iran, the areas of the EAEU's international activities for 2022, observer state status in the EAEU, and the functioning of a common services market. * * * Speech by the President of Russia at the Eurasian Economic Council meeting President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Tokayev, colleagues, friends, Like the speakers before me, I would like to thank our Kazakhstani friends for their work during Kazakhstan's chairmanship in the Eurasian Economic Union this year. I want to stress that I have seen and I know how personally engaged the President of Kazakhstan is in this work. He devotes a great deal of his time to it. Despite the difficulties caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the volatility of global markets, our cooperation within the EAEU has been quite productive. Indeed, I would like to confirm once again the words of our Kazakhstani colleague. The First President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev was the one who initiated this union. I remember very well his telephone call when he asked me several, should I say, sacramental questions about Russia's priorities for the nearest future. We agreed that creating an integration union would be the priority for both Kazakhstan and Russia. We had discussed it before. Belarus and even Ukraine were ready to join it. It did not work out with Ukraine although the Ukrainian leaders at the time expressed their intention to join us. Nevertheless, thanks to the First President of Kazakhstan, this process started to develop and today, we can see that it was the right thing to do, during this difficult period for the entire global economy and for our economy as well. We can see that, thanks to our joint efforts, we also managed to increase mutual trade, despite all the difficulties. Over the nine months of this year, the trade between the EAEU members increased by around 16 percent, according to Mr Tokayev, and by 10 percent compared to 2019, before the coronavirus, according to our statistics. At any rate, it is a good result. Mutual investment, the financial sector and the labour market are also showing steady growth. I would also like to point out with satisfaction that the improvement of the EAEU legislation is ongoing. It is being adjusted to the new challenging tasks of our integration development. Our countries' economic ministries and agencies are working actively with the Eurasian Economic Commission to identify and remove obstacles to the free movement of goods, services, capital and workforce, which the First President of Kazakhstan has mentioned in his statement today. New major steps, or rather a big step will be made in this direction today in connection with a large package of amendments to the Treaty on the Eurasian Economic Union that has been prepared and submitted for our approval. The goal of these amendments is to fill in the existing gaps in the legal regulation of our economic activity in the EAEU space. Russia was directly involved in drafting these amendments, and we certainly support their adoption. We also support the draft joint documents on the further development of our common services market, including in the construction, audit and evaluation sectors. In addition to this, today we are expected to approve an agreement on the use of electronic navigation seals in the EAEU, which has been drafted at Russia's initiative. I would like to repeat what we said on this score several years ago: I fully agree with our colleagues, who have spoken about this just now, that these seals allow us to monitor cross-border cargo transportation, guarantee the safety of goods, and simplify border clearance procedures. Incidentally, this will also greatly alleviate the concern of many other countries, which are watching the activities of our Union and have observer status in it. The use of such seals will certainly enhance the transparency of customs operations and will have a positive impact on the development of the transportation services sector in the EAEU. Our colleague from Kyrgyzstan has said this just now, and I fully agree with him. It is also important that this will make our transit routes more attractive for the movement of goods between Europe and the Asia-Pacific. Russia has several other proposals on how to ensure the transparency of the EAEU goods and services markets, and we hope they will meet with the support of our integration partners. In particular, we are talking about a broader introduction of goods-marking mechanisms that are already in use for certain items. This practice has proven its effectiveness in addressing such tasks as combating illegal trade, especially in the consumer sector, increasing tax revenues to the budgets of the member countries, and creating a competitive environment for businesses. The Russian side is also consistently promoting the further expansion of mutually beneficial industrial cooperation within the EAEU, as the President of Belarus has said today. This year, a comprehensive strategy of industrial cooperation between the EAEU member countries and the roadmap to implement it have been approved. These mutually complementary documents lay the foundation for deepening cooperation ties between production enterprises of our states and accelerating the import substitution process within the Union. Efforts to combat the coronavirus infection encourage our countries to establish closer partnership in the pharmaceutical industry and in medicine in general. I remember when the Prime Minister of Armenia initiated our joint work in this area and even proposed an entire programme in this context. In fact, we are implementing it right now. In line with the instruction that we gave as part of our meeting last December, most EAEU states have established the production of Russian vaccines. At the same time, I would like to stress that Russia has not only invested in industrial capacities and new jobs, but also organised the transfer of the most advanced biomedical technologies. This way our EAEU partners managed to speed up the vaccination of their population with highly effective medicines – produced locally, let me stress this. Thanks to this, collective immunity to COVID-19 is increasing throughout the Eurasian space. This is important for creating conditions to fully resume the free movement of our people across the Union. The implementation of another joint project in the field of innovation and information technology, I mean the smartphone mobile app Travel without COVID-19, also helps in resuming the movement of people during the pandemic. By the way, in addition to the EAEU, it is used in other countries, too: Azerbaijan, Moldova, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. We suggest carrying on the work to improve its functions and expand the locations of its use. There are also other highly relevant and important areas where we need to boost cooperation between the EAEU member states, such as the climate agenda and the green transformation of the economy. My colleagues just spoke about that. By the way, at Russia's initiative, a special high-level working group was formed to coordinate our positions regarding counteracting greenhouse gas emissions and reaching carbon neutrality and protecting the environment. We count on the further constructive work with our EAEU partners in this area. I know that all of you, colleagues, are involved one way or another in this work. I suggest we act more consistently and actively in this field. I am pleased to note that observer states are joining the activity of the Eurasian Union more actively; we already spoke about it today and I heartily welcome our colleagues from Cuba and Uzbekistan. By the way, Moldova also showed interest in this. They have the opportunity to take part in the activity of the integration agencies at all levels, learn about the process of preparing integration documents and using them to implement the decisions made. We know how the energy situation in Europe is developing. Moldova could have been closer to dealing with some issues and probably it would have been easier for it to deal with new ones if it were up to speed on all the developments and the decisions we make. But we have come to an arrangement, proceeding from common interests, and dealt with those issues. But it is a fact, if they had the information, it would be easier for them to solve some problems we are talking about now. In addition, the EAEU integration attracts the attention and interest of other foreign states. In particular, a flexible system of interaction between our Union and the member states of such integration associations as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and ASEAN has been developed. Talks are underway with Iran on signing a full agreement on free trade; we already spoke about it today. We have also agreed with Iran to extend the existing interim agreement to three years or until the permanent agreement on free trade comes into force. The implementation of this document will bring good results, I am sure. I also want to emphasise that Russia supports the boosting of international business ties and contacts of the Eurasian Economic Union, as well as the further expansion of the range of preferential and non-preferential agreements with other countries. And, of course, we also support the presented draft resolution on this issue. From this perspective, I want to note that our Kyrgyzstani friends, who will hold the chairmanship in the Eurasian Union next year, will face truly serious and demanding challenges. Of course, Kyrgyzstan can count on Russia's every possible assistance. Thank you for your attention."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67331,Meeting of Council for Civil Society and Human Rights,2021-12-09T19:25:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region",Vladimir Putin held a meeting of the Council for Civil Society and Human Rights via videoconference.,"Excerpts from transcript of meeting of the Council for Civil Society and Human Right President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues. It is a pleasure to see all of you. We are meeting on the eve of Human Rights Day, which the entire world has been celebrating for over 70 years now. As a rule, we time meetings of our council to this remarkable date. However, you know well that you have to focus continuously on the protection of human rights and freedoms and keep them on the council's agenda. Each of you is making a tangible contribution to what is truly a noble mission without any exaggeration. I would like to convey my sincere greetings to you on the upcoming Human Rights Day and wish you success in your difficult but very important and much-needed work. I would like to emphasise that our Council has one more equally important task. I am referring to the development of civil society. As we agreed two years ago, this task also requires special attention and hard work. I am happy to note that now the Council is actively dealing with pressing problems that are causing concern in our society. One of them is protecting people from financial fraud. Criminals have deprived tens of millions of people of their housing, literally leaving them out in the street. The Council persistently raised this issue and eventually amendments were introduced to the law on the activities of consumer credit co-operatives, banning the issuance of loans secured only by housing as collateral. This created a barrier in the way of fraudulent schemes of microcredit organisations. I will now say what has been done as a result of the Council's decisions or discussions on issues that really worry our people. The next thing I would like to point out is that the Council has supported the owners of agricultural lands who had no right to maintain forests on their land plots. Facing huge fines, they had to destroy these forests. The Council's view on that matter was taken into account as well, and the Forest Code has been amended to allow landowners to keep the forests, which has saved hundreds of hectares of forest. Another solution to which the Council has contributed was to ensure the compliance of foreign IT companies operating in Russia with Russian legislation. It is no secret that there have been numerous cases of fraud, abuse of our citizens' personal data and the distribution of illegal content, including content dangerous to children, on transnational online platforms. At the same time, people have nowhere to turn to with their complaints or to demand the restoration of their rights. On July 1, 2021, we adopted a law stipulating that foreign IT companies must""land"" in Russia. Despite its informal name, the law clearly stipulates that international companies working in the Russian segment of the internet must register in accordance with Russian law and open their offices here. I would also like to mention a solution that concerns a small group of people but is extremely important for every one of them. It concerns children after a retinoblastoma operation. These children need to confirm their disability every year until they grow up to receive financial support for the prosthetic eye care– I remember how we discussed that matter and how our colleagues raised it. The issue has been settled following discussions at the Council, and now the disability certificate the children receive after surgery remains valid until they turn 18. Our public is greatly concerned about and rightfully brings up issues of environmental protection. In fact, this is taking place all over the world, which we can see and are very well aware of. One of them concerns the gradual phasing out of disposable and intractable goods. This is a global trend. Russia is also getting ready to fulfil this versatile, multi-faceted task. Traditionally paying much attention to environmental protection, your council has developed proposals and submitted them to the Government of the Russian Federation, which is now working on a corresponding draft law. All these are examples of meaningful, constructive cooperation between civil society and government bodies on resolving pressing issues. Once again: environmental issues, protection of social rights, and demographic problems are priorities of our national development strategy. It focusses on people and their requirements. Importantly, these areas play an important role in your work as well. Colleagues, As we know, life is not always serene and rosy, especially in our time, filled with new problems, challenges and even threats. In these conditions, a big role is played by the council's efforts to get to the bottom of various high-profile cases, and include experts and representatives from civil society organisations in the analysis, those that are well familiar with the subjects being discussed. In general, as I have said many times, you are often more sensitive to the needs of the people, and feel their mood better than even government officials do. You come up with your own approaches following an attentive and detailed analysis. The council and its commissions announce their position during heated debates as well. Cases that have recently evoked a wide response in society are bound to be raised today. I know that you have analysed them, and your opinion is very important when adopting decisions on ensuring human rights. I would like to end my opening remarks at this point. I know there are plenty of potential speakers among us, and those who announced their desire to speak in advance. As at our previous meetings, I will try to give the floor to as many of our colleagues as possible who want to speak on various matters. But by tradition, I would first like to hear Mr Valery Fadeyev. Please, you have the floor.(In his report, Chair of the Council for Civil Society and Human Rights Valery Fadeyev focused on the implementation of the presidential instructions issued a year ago, and on certain items on the current agenda. One of the items concerns the coronavirus pandemic and human rights, in particular, the use of QR-codes in public places and municipal transport. In addition, the issue was raised about enforcing the law on organisations that act as foreign agents, abuse of office and torture in the Federal Penitentiary Service system(FSIN), migration policy, protecting user rights and freedoms in the digital space, and a federal law under which foreign IT companies must open offices in Russia. The matter on benefits for holders of three Orders of Courage was brought up as well.) Vladimir Putin: As far as I know, you outlined issues that were at the centre of the Council's attention. I looked at the list of speakers. One way or another, most of these issues will be discussed separately. Therefore, there is probably no need to react to each of your issues now. However, the last one about providing benefits for the holders of three Orders of Courage deserves, of course, not only to be worked though, but to be acted upon as soon as possible. I agree with you, and an instruction to this end will be issued to the Government shortly. I am not sure we should be discussing QR-codes or foreign agent registration now. I am sure our colleagues will cover this later. Or, do I need to take these topics and… Then, I think the discussion will be over. With regard to handling personal data, I fully share your concerns. I myself have spoken out on this many times, and I believe that we must give some thought to how we should organise it. It is absolutely impossible to move forward without AI technology, which relies on big data, including personal data. We are aware of this, but there is a clear threat from the point of view of ensuring individual rights. The Government has received instructions to this end, and work is underway, even though it is not being conducted the way I, or apparently you, would like, because there are too many leaks. It is absolutely necessary to take proper steps to ensure individual interests and rights. The Government is focusing on this, and our colleagues are working on it, so I hope they will come up with corresponding proposals soon. As for migration policy, this is one of the most important issues for both the economy and the social wellbeing of our people. You said there are no estimates on how much of a foreign workforce we need. This is not exactly true; estimates are being made, especially in construction. Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin has repeatedly reported to me on the needs of the construction industry, the construction sector of the economy, for foreign workers, but this is a separate issue. I fully agree with those who have concerns in this context. Of course, we should cooperate with our colleagues, primarily from the CIS countries, on this. We should explain to those who want to work in our country that they need to prepare for this journey and for their jobs here. They should study the language, our laws and their rights; they should know what our public organisations and government bodies expect from them as regards the observance of the laws and rules of the Russian Federation, and the customs of the people in the territories where they will live. I can say that we discuss this in considerable detail with our colleagues from the commonwealth countries. I had a conversation about this recently with Uzbekistan's President during his visit to our country. He said Uzbekistan is also interested in preparing people who plan to move here. He noted that Uzbekistan's government bodies are willing to promote this process. We are working on this with our other partners: Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. This is why we keep this issue in the focus. This does not mean that everything has been accomplished in this respect. Quite the reverse; this is only the beginning. As for the tracking of people by various companies, platforms and so on, I fully agree that it is necessary to put things in order there. I will not go into detail now to avoid taking up your time because I must give our other colleagues an opportunity to speak. That said, I fully share your concerns. Maybe, let us move on and give our colleagues an opportunity to speak. Marina Akhmedova, please.(Council member Marina Akhmedova spoke about the problems of the homeless and offered some proposals on resolving them.) Vladimir Putin: Ms Akhmedova, you have raised a very sensitive issue. I think that, listening to this, anyone born in the Soviet times would recall that we used to call the""ulcers of capitalism"" that the socialist system did not have, or almost did not have. There were homeless people then but not so many. And, of course, every municipal or Government official is bound to be ashamed of what is happening in this country. I think I said at the Valdai Club recently that classic capitalism is gradually disappearing in the international arena because it triggers too many differences and eventually brings itself down. In our current life, in our reality, we should all feel ashamed when facing the problems you spoke about and the destroyed human destinies you described. We often talk about the bureaucratic callousness of officials but this is about individuals. We have many officials who are conscientious and scrupulous, who are responsible at what they are doing, but of course there are different approaches. Meanwhile, the state should organise its work properly to be able to render assistance and support to people who have found themselves in such a difficult situation regardless of circumstances, regardless of why it happens. If a person lives on the street without means of subsistence, medical care or housing, this is certainly a special case that requires particular attention from the authorities. I fully agree with you. Of course, it is necessary to work on everything you have mentioned: registration and registration through the government services website, and so on. But it is perfectly obvious that it is necessary to deal with this problem and deal with it more purposefully with a view to granting practical assistance to a specific person. This also probably concerns hospitals, and not just one or in one area. Naturally, all these measures require funding. But what, exactly, do we need state funding for? We need it to resolve these urgent problems; these are our people, our citizens. Therefore, we will certainly deal with this, and the Government will receive relevant instructions. It would be great if this problem were resolved as soon as possible, but we will have to plan and monitor the pace of this effort as well. I would also like to ask you not to quit this work. Of course, it is very important to cooperate with NGOs in this respect, no doubt about this, and with religious organisations as well. I know that all our traditional religions are involved in this work in one way or another. They are helping people, and it is necessary to encourage this as much as possible, to develop cooperation with them and support them in this effort. Thank you very much. I have made a note for myself. We will work on this. Eva Merkacheva, go ahead please.(In her remarks, Council member Eva Merkacheva talked about violations in the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia, including violence towards inmates and torture, reports of which have recently appeared on the internet. She reported on the initiative to introduce amendments to the Criminal Code by adding a separate chapter on torture. Merkacheva also spoke about the large numbers of people in pretrial detention centres, the use of modern technology and tracking methods instead of detention, the creation of correction centre, and equipping prison hospitals.) Vladimir Putin: This is certainly a very important problem. Of course, I followed what was going on and read this information. We must get to the bottom of it. The Central Office of the Investigative Committee is conducting a preliminary inquiry into the issues that have become public and are now being reviewed as part of the criminal cases that have been opened. But, of course, I agree with you that it is necessary to take system-wide measures that would change the situation. Everything you mentioned definitely needs to be very carefully analysed, after which relevant measures can be adopted. I would like to inform you that, first, the Federation Council has already started introducing amendments to the legislation that actually define the crime of torture. This work is underway. In any event, the Federation Council has raised this issue and is working on it. Now about other restrictions on freedom– not only detention, especially pretrial detention. Of course, the Ministry of Justice will receive support, and work on the draft federal law on probation will be expedited. These are obvious things– house arrest and the bracelets you mentioned. Everything should be done to monitor a person suspected of committing a crime. But before a court concludes whether the crime was committed or not, there are certainly no grounds at all for putting a person behind bars, in a cell. I assure you that I fully agree with you. As for compulsory labour, I also think it is possible to broaden the use of this option in sentence enforcement. I would just like to note that this instruction has already been given to the Government and, moreover, the Government has endorsed the concept for developing the penal and correctional system of the Russian Federation up to 2030. One of its main areas is broader use of compulsory labour. Work is underway on all these issues and will be stepped up after our today's meeting, while relevant instructions will be adjusted accordingly. Thank you very much. No doubt, this is a very important issue for all of us. Such things are absolutely unacceptable. What is there to say? You are saying the right things. It is necessary to work on this consistently and get results. <…>(Irina Borovova raised the issue of observing human rights during the COVID-19 vaccination campaign and introduction of electronic certificates and QR codes according to the bill that the State Duma is considering at the moment. She specifically drew attention to cancer patients. Irina Borovova also thanked the President for the Fighting Cancer programme.) Vladimir Putin: Ms Borovova, as for the Fighting Cancer programme, it is one of our top priorities in public healthcare exactly because this disease poses a significant threat to a great number of our citizens. It is what we have been working on together, including with representatives of the medical community. This programme is the result of our collaboration with you and your colleagues. It is important that this programme receive the necessary funding on time and in full. Judging from what I see, it will happen. These funds must be spent efficiently. This is the first point. Second, concerning vaccination certificates, as you know they only serve as proof of vaccination. We also know that almost all countries have chosen the same path, all countries without exception that have the opportunity to vaccinate their people. Still, we have to proceed very carefully, weigh out every step and understand what is happening. The entire procedure must be perfectly clear and transparent. It must not create any additional problems for people. There is more to it, though. Some people are opposed to vaccination and object to any restrictions. And those who support vaccination receive jabs and demand, including from officials in their regions, that they be guarded from the unvaccinated. You see, there are certain issues in society that also need to be addressed. At any rate, we must make decisions carefully. I agree with you that before introducing any restrictions on public transport, we must fully consider the consequences and check if the transport system is ready. We must not restrict people's rights, on the one hand, while ensuring their security and safety. Therefore, before we issue any final decisions, they must be exhaustively discussed. This law is, to a great extent, a framework law. Of course, it still needs to be thoroughly reviewed by regional officials as they will be granted significant authority with respect to final decisions. I hope that will be the approach we take. I mean that we will, in cooperation with the professional community, find a solution that can guarantee the rights of all citizens. Thank you. We will work on this extremely carefully and make sure that no hasty decisions are made. <…>(In his remarks, Kirill Kabanov focused on violence among teenagers and young adults, noting that negative and aggressive behavioural scenarios are being widely broadcast in the digital space, online communities and teenage groups, and emphasised that this negative and dangerous behaviour infiltrated Russia from the West and its culture. Kabanov suggested a number of measures to prevent this, including raising the professional level of teachers, creating school mechanisms for eliminating conflicts and reinforcing state bodies' efforts to prevent juvenile delinquency.) Vladimir Putin: I think everyone understands that you touched on a very important and sensitive matter that worries everyone without exaggeration. The bullying you mentioned and the promotion of Western culture, although this has nothing to do with culture, in our society, and these behaviour patterns are often promoted by social media. Western parliamentarians are now actively discussing the impact of these international platforms on the minds of younger people and their personal development, and their negative impact on the psyche of teenagers and children. We, too, should step up and take a closer look at that. Europe is paying much attention to this, and the United States is beginning to raise these issues at public or parliamentary platforms. So, the issue that Mr Kabanov raised is extremely important. Of course, it requires a comprehensive approach which is what this proposal is all about as far as I can see. Of course, I agree that the proposals regarding preventive measures should be considered and supported. This includes additional measures, such as introducing educators who are now becoming available at schools, and more should become available, training and retraining of teachers, and so on. We must implement and improve measures to prevent juvenile delinquency in the broadest sense of the word. Of course, we should proceed with caution given the young age of the people we are talking about, but we must do it nonetheless. I fully agree. We will work on this. <…>(Pavel Gusev spoke about the law on foreign agents in the media, which he described as one of the most controversial laws, listed its shortcomings and proposed creating a separate working group with the participation of corresponding parliamentary committees, journalist unions, and the Council for Civil Society and Human Rights in order to deal with the issues that are haunting media outlets recognised as foreign agents.) Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much, Mr Gusev. Here is what I would like to say. Of course, the incidents that you cited are comical, and the overreaction you noted is obvious. Of course, we should pay attention to what you said, including the way this document was drafted, meaning that it was not discussed with the professional community. We must do more than just note this. This work must be done and we must see how it works and what it leads to. However, Mr Gusev, you are well aware of how our media are being treated in foreign countries. They are declared foreign agents, summoned to courts, called in for questioning and face imprisonment if they do not show up. You and I have known each other well for a long time now, and we understand what this is about. We must ensure freedom of speech and, to a certain extent, the inviolability of people who talk about the flaws of our society, the imperfections of our state apparatus and the governance system, and questions that arise during election campaigns. No doubt about it. What we need to do though is protect ourselves from potential external interference in our domestic affairs. We need to protect ourselves from anyone using any kind of tool in Russia to pursue their goals that have nothing to do with our interests. This is what we are talking about. Of course, this is a delicate job. When it comes to the media, we need to proceed with caution so as not to""de-energise"" or""blunt"" the tools that we absolutely need to uphold our own interests, to move our country forward, and to develop democratic institutions, as well as to make our society and economy more competitive as well as to be able to move forward. To reiterate, we must prevent the use of any tool that would ultimately get in the way of our development or lead to the destruction of our country and our society. We need to be subtle and proceed with caution. I agree with what you said. Let's get back to this issue together with the professional community and develop, as far as practicable, concerted decisions. I do not think I need to go into detail now since you are aware of my position; I tried to express it again just now. We will be moving along this path. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. <…>(Kirill Vyshinsky said the Human Rights Council Commission on International Cooperation, which he heads, centres on helping the largest community of our compatriots in Donbass exercise their rights and protecting Russian citizens and our compatriots' rights in the CIS and non-CIS countries. He also talked about participating in Russian elections and a variety of benefits that Russian citizens, in particular, residents of Donbass who do not have residence permits in Russia, are unable to access. Mr Vyshinsky also mentioned Russophobia citing the Baltic states, Ukraine and the United States as examples. He emphasised that Russophobia is being formalised in many areas of life, including at the state level, as some kind of discrimination against language and social spheres, among other things, which could even lead to genocide, and asked the President to issue instructions to develop and introduce the concept of genocide or appeals for genocide against Soviet(in historical terms) and Russian multi-ethnic people into Russian law.) Vladimir Putin: Thank you, Mr Vyshinsky. With regard to improving the voting process for our compatriots abroad, I agree that we need to give it a thought and take the necessary measures, even though it may cost us extra. I think you are right. Wherever they may live, Russian citizens should be able to enjoy the rights of our citizens in full. The same applies to social rights and benefits. I will definitely instruct the Government to work this through. I hope we will come to concerted decisions. I must say the same thing about Russophobia as the first step towards genocide. We are well aware of the current developments in Donbass which are very reminiscent of genocide. We need to proceed with caution so as not to devalue these concepts, but they still must reflect the realities of unfolding events. Let's think about this. Mr Vyshinsky, as someone who deeply engages in this matter, what do you think about the situation in Donbass? Kirill Vyshinsky: You see, my evaluations are based on evidence. My colleagues, friends and acquaintances who live in Donbass– of course, they are used to what is happening there, including the shelling attacks– say that the situation has worsened over the past 30–45 days. To reiterate, they are brave people, and they have been living in these circumstances for more than seven years now, but they remain calm. But, you know, such an escalation always makes you wonder: why is this happening, why now, and what for? To reiterate, the people in Donbass remain confident that they will cope with this, but they are seeing a deterioration of the situation. The number of shelling attacks is up, and the targeting areas are getting closer, for example, to Donetsk. To put it in simple terms, things do not look good. Vladimir Putin: Good. Thank you. <…>(Igor Ashmanov described the newly developed concept for protecting civil rights in the digital space, the risks of digital discrimination against citizens, and oversight of access to digital means of production. He also covered social media and mentioned a volunteer civic project that the HRC came up with in cooperation with the Civic Chamber, parent associations, and so on. The issue is about content which is harmful and dangerous, primarily for children and young adults, which is considered unacceptable in Russia, not by law, but because all digital developers have agreed that this content is unacceptable. Plans are in place to make it a civic project based on the Public Centre for Internet Technology and the Regional Public Centre for Internet Technology, and to reach an agreement with the majority of Russian digital platform developers to the effect that they voluntarily agree on which content listed on the common ethical platform is unacceptable.) Vladimir Putin: Of course, the issue that you raised is important and sensitive, and we discussed this at the beginning of our meeting. Again, I will not say anything new. Believe me, I am very worried about this as well. I totally agree with you. Let's consider how to act in concert with the participants in this process. Let's face it, attempts have already been made, including at the suggestion of the Presidential Executive Office, whereby our main companies have created an alliance which engages in developing certain corporate behaviour guidelines with an eye towards ensuring interests and rights of our citizens. Above all, we are talking about content that can be harmful to young adults, children and teenagers. So, I agree with almost everything that has been said here. I suggest that we keep working on it. Please, draft it properly, and I will issue corresponding instructions for the Government and legislators. Igor Ashmanov: Mr President, maybe a civic project does not need to start with presidential instructions to the Government, because it is a civic project after all. I believe your approval is enough to get it going. Vladimir Putin: You see, approval alone is usually not enough, because you also need administrative support. This is what I was taking about, and I am willing to do so. Thank you. <…>(Nikolai Svanidze raised the issue of the developments around Memorial. The Prosecutor's Office called on the court to shut down International Memorial and the Memorial human rights centre and asked the President to take control of the matter. In addition, Mr Svanidze spoke about the detention of Professor Sergei Zuyev, who is accused of an economic crime. Mr Svanidze said this was a harsh pre-trial restriction considering Zuyev's health.) Vladimir Putin: Thank you, Mr Svanidze. Of course, I paid attention to the media publications on Memorial and, naturally, asked my colleagues for additional information on what is going on there. I know you may not agree with this, but I would still like you to know about this and listen. What documents did I receive regarding the court trial? Incidentally, it is not yet over, and we should monitor these proceedings. I hope they will be unbiased. But what did I pay attention to, and what documents was I given for reference? As for the international organisations Memorial is trying to defend, they are blacklisted in Russia as terrorist and extremist organisations. Of course, this issue requires additional study. I know that some colleagues, including Council members, claim that a number of these organisations do not fall into this category, for instance, Hizb ut-Tahrir and Tablighi Jamaat, among others. But this is a separate topic. In any case, as of today, these organisations are recognised exactly as extremist and terrorist. The second problem is that unfortunately Memorial has repeatedly committed violations, and, as the document given to me reads, it did so defiantly. Its violations were blatant. Finally, there is one more aspect linked with the activities of Memorial, which indisputably is one of the most reputable organisations, and this is how I have always treated it. You mentioned that Holocaust Day has disappeared from the list of observed dates for some reason. Frankly, I fully agree with you. Yes, of course, millions upon millions of members of other ethnic groups in addition to the Jewish population of Russia and the Soviet Union experienced violence at the hands of the Nazis. But these are absolutely obvious things, the atrocities against the Jewish population, and, of course, we should not forget about this as part of the general picture of crimes committed by the Nazis in the world, including our country. This is perfectly obvious. But what would I like to draw your attention to in this context? You also said that Memorial is the main guardian of the memory of the victims of political repression in the Soviet Union. Indeed, this is how I always saw it. But, since we have already raised this subject, I would like to mention studies, some of which were conducted by Israeli specialists. They found the names of such people as Pyotr Petrovskis, Lisovsky and Kovalevsky in the list of those whom Memorial numbers with the victims of political repressions, Soviet political repressions. The first one, Pyotr Petrovskis, served the Germans in the police. He detained and escorted Jewish prisoners to the place of their execution and later on boasted to his neighbours. There is specific evidence of this, and here are his exact words:""Today, this revolver…"" I will not quote the words of this criminal, but he went on to say how many Jews he had killed– a hundred people. The second one, Ivan Lisovsky, began his career in 1941 as a gang leader of a group of undertakers that shot Jews. Later he served in the Latvian police and was a direct participant in the murder of 11,000 Jews. One more man was also found to be involved in these atrocities as regards Jews in Ludza. He killed 800 people. Therefore, Memorial itself should make its current activities fully meet the noble goals that it declared to be the main area of its work and should prevent anything similar to what I have just mentioned. I can name the author of this study. He is Aron Shneer. He is one of those who studied this part of the activities as a professional. I think we can trust this source. Overall, I believe you are right in drawing attention to what is happening in this area, including the activities of Memorial itself in general. I will certainly take a close look at this once again. As for the pre-trial restriction for the man you mentioned, from Shaninka, it is necessary to have a look at this. Here I cannot but agree with you again. I do not see any need to keep a man behind bars for the offenses he is charged with. So I will definitely look at his case once again. Thank you very much. <…>(Alexander Sokurov became quite emotional as he proceeded to express his point of view on multiple issues, starting with a letter from the people living in an old village in the Leningrad Region, which may be destroyed if the authorities go through with their plan to build a transport interchange there. He also brought up Russia's federal structure, problems in the North Caucasus, a number of regional border conflicts, human rights concerns, support for the Russian North and its culture. Alexander Sokurov ended his remarks by saying:""I apologise for speaking so long and so passionately, too passionately. I am sorry."" Vladimir Putin: Indeed, an apology is in order. An apology is in order, Mr Sokurov, because those were not remarks, but a manifesto, a heap of problems and fears harboured by some of our citizens. It is always like that. Some of these problems and fears, perhaps, relate to things that lie on the surface and are hypertrophied, others have been picked in a very strange manner and I do not understand what they are about at all. For example, you said that all our republics have an ethnic aspect to them now. Was it any different before? Was it any different in the Soviet Union? The only difference is that now they cannot leave the single state, whereas back then they could do so without any restrictions. Towards the end, you said we should let everyone who does not want to live with us go. How do you know who wants to live with us and who does not? Alexander Sokurov: Let us check it out. Vladimir Putin: We did already during the voting on the Constitution, among other things. Take a look at how people vote. We can debate this issue if you like and as long as you like. But I assure you that the overwhelming majority of the people realise what kind of trouble they will face if they act differently. By the way, the Chechen people know this better than anyone else in the Caucasus. You mentioned diversity and cited Daghestan as an example. A very good example, by the way. Daghestan is a multi-ethnic republic. What are you suggesting? To divide Daghestan? Or, take Karachayevo-Circassia. Should we divide Karachais and Circassians? There are many issues there, I am very well aware of them. We have 2,000 territorial claims in our country. Mr Sokurov, do you want to see a repeat of the Yugoslavia scenario on our territory? Alexander Sokurov: No, my suggestion is to think. Our Constitution is 100 years old, and our nation-building is 100 years old as well. Vladimir Putin: Mr Sokurov, this is not a discussion, but an exchange of views. Otherwise, it will become like a talk show with us talking over each other non-stop. I have known you for a very long time now, and I have a lot of respect for you, because you always speak your mind. Frankly, though, you are not always accurate in what you say. Certain things should be properly considered and reviewed first, such as relations among the Nakh people. Please take these matters seriously. To reiterate, there are 2,000 territorial claims in Russia.""Do not trouble trouble,"" as they say. These matters must be taken very seriously. And talking about this lightly for everyone in our country to hear is not something that even you should do. I assure you that these are dangerous games, we have been here before. And like I said in our previous discussion, people of our age will not go to war. Do not worry about our army. It is doing fine, it is developing. An organisation as complex as an army, with almost a million service members, cannot go without issues. But if you look at our army of the mid-1990s and today's army… Just look at what those who have declared us an adversary are saying about our army. You will get an idea of the distance covered by our army, its current status and what we can count on in the near future. Then, things like who is living off our allowance. You can think whatever you want about Belarus, Belarusians, or the leadership of Belarus, but to say that it lives off our allowance is incorrect, Mr Sokurov. It is unseemly to say so in public. This shows disrespect for the entire nation and the entire country, which is part of the Union State. This is a delicate and lengthy process that requires exceptional competence and patience, and respect for your partner. We will not get anywhere if we act differently. And we can only strive for one thing which is mutual understanding and building these relations on a mutually beneficial basis, which would lead us to better overall competitiveness and to overcoming the issues facing our peoples. So, these matters should be tackled with caution. The same applies to the fact that we must support the Caucasus which is part of the Russian Federation. There is another approach, where people professing extreme views– we have them, too, unfortunately– say:""Let us disband everything and live the life that we want."" We are already living the life that we want.""We will let those who do not want to live with us go."" Again, what makes you think that the overwhelming majority of the people in the republics do not want to live with us? Probably, there are some people of that kind. The bloodshed of the mid-1990s– early 2000s showed us what this can lead to. Do you want this? We do not. So, letting people professing such views go is a very dangerous thing. It can end very badly. And we have done a lot to step away from this dangerous line. Do not push us back there. Do not. With regard to us feeding or not feeding someone, disbanding or not disbanding, are the Russian people, whose interests you just mentioned, interested in the disintegration and collapse of the Russian Federation? Will it then be true Russia, which was originally built as a country of multiple ethnicities and religions? Do you want to turn us into the Grand Duchy of Moscow? Well, this is what NATO wants. Alexander Sokurov: I would like to suggest that we think about what is happening in the country and how it operates. I suggest that we do some thinking, Mr President. Vladimir Putin: Mr Sokurov, no one is against thinking. Before saying this, you should have given it more thought. Come see me, I have not seen you in a long while. You know how I feel about our meetings and discussions. I am always delighted to have a conversation with you. But before you say such things publicly, you should think carefully. Please do not be mad at me, because these are very serious matters. Alexander Sokurov: It is always better to be straightforward about things. Vladimir Putin: Well, some things can be put bluntly, but others are better off not talking about. Some matters are highly sensitive. Call me, come over and we will have a discussion. No question about it. It is just that these are very subtle and delicate matters. You can hurt people's feeling very easily. Alexander Sokurov: I agree. Vladimir Putin: This will hinder rather than help our constructive efforts. With regard to your request concerning the village of Luzhitsa, of course, we will work on it. I will do so by all means, I promise. This is the Kingisepp District, correct? If there is the slightest chance to build this traffic interchange at another location, we will, of course, have it built elsewhere. I agree. Thank you very much. <…>(Genri Reznik raised the issue of foreign agents, noting the imperfections of the relevant law, in particular regarding research organisations as well as his colleagues in the legal profession. According to him, the enforcement of this law must be adjusted. He asked the President to create a corresponding working group that would include representatives of professional communities: the academic community, the media community, politicians and State Duma members. Genri Reznik disagreed with the premise that Russia had""become hostile to the entire world"", and any funding coming from abroad is toxic and it is presumed from the onset that it is used to harm Russia.) Vladimir Putin: I would like to say the following in this connection. I will start with the thesis that you have clearly formulated when you said,""Russia has become hostile to the entire world."" This is not true. Russia has not become hostile towards any part of the world. A certain part of the world considers Russia to be its adversary. Have we ever in our strategic institutional documents written down that we designate someone as our adversary? No, we have not; it is we who are being declared an adversary. Why? There is a very simple answer. Let us look at the mid-1990s and early 2000s. By the early 2000s I had already purged everyone; however, in the mid-1990s we had career officers of the US Central Intelligence Agency, as it was later found out, as advisors and officials in the Russian Federation Government. The US subsequently brought criminal charges against them for violating the US law and participating in the privatisation while they worked in our country as CIA officers. This is just one example, but there are many more in reality. Thus, first, everything in this area was under the control of certain countries. US specialists were posted to the facilities of our nuclear weapons complex. They used to come to work there every day, from morning to evening, they had a desk with a US flag on it. They lived and worked there. They did not need such subtle instruments of interference in our political life since they had an overall control anyway. The situation has certainly changed: the country has become different, it has become more independent, more sovereign, our Armed Forces capabilities are growing, and the attitude towards Russia has begun changing. Let us recall the attitude towards Russia's first president Boris Yeltsin. Everything was fine, everyone happily clapped him on the back. But as soon as he raised his voice in defence of Yugoslavia and spoke of the illegitimate actions(and we understand that those were absolutely illegitimate actions which violated international law regarding Yugoslavia when it was being bombed without any authorisation from the Security Council, it was a gross violation of international law, you know and understand it too well whatever anyone present here might say), so as soon as Boris Yeltsin raised his voice in defence of international law and the rights of the people of Yugoslavia to be treated in a civilised way, the attitude towards Russia changed instantly as well as towards Boris Yeltsin personally. We know this and remember it very well. Thus, as soon as Russia began to declare its interests, to state that it has them, began building up its sovereignty, the economy and military capabilities, a need arose for different instruments to influence our domestic politics, including fairly subtle instruments via different organisations that are funded from abroad. As both you and I know, we did not invent anything new here. I think, such a law has been in effect in the United States since 1938 or 1937, and remains in force now. And when they say that it is old and was passed a long time ago– yes, it was passed some time ago and in this sense it is old, but it is being enforced today, including with respect to Russian organisations. Can you imagine a Russian NGO somewhere in Europe or in the US with a critical stance towards those countries' policies? It is impossible even to imagine it. Our registered media outlets are designated as foreign agents there. As I said earlier during today's discussion, they are detained and questioned, and threatened with a possible prison term. What we are doing is nothing but a light reminder of what is being done in other countries to protect their sovereignty and their domestic policy. You know that our law does not prohibit the activities of those organisations; it does not. Nevertheless, I have repeatedly said so at our previous meetings and I want to say it again that I agree with you on some points. Of course, it is necessary to clearly delineate research activities and why they are treated as political. Although, do you know what is happening? Let's say certain decisions are made regarding those organisations that are funded from abroad and engage in political activities. Their funding channels are cut to a certain extent– and there immediately spring up others, or those organisations that were never involved in such activities but are interested in additional funding, get it and begin to adapt their activities to work off the funds, or they become a kind of a hub to channel that money to other structures. So, Mr Reznik, we have to look carefully, we must respect ourselves and must not allow anyone to interfere in our affairs. However, I cannot but agree with you that we have to look very carefully into those documents so that they are legally substantiated and do not harm us, so that the concepts are never replaced with something else and do not prevent patriotically-minded people with a critical view of the developments in the country from effectively performing their activities in the interests of our state and people. Thus, let us analyse all that again, I agree, let us look into it and work on it, maybe within specially established structures. And if there are any extremes or excesses there, they must certainly be corrected, I agree with you. Thank you very much. <…>(Andrei Babushkin began his remarks by talking about Russia's small indigenous peoples, in particular, their traditional occupations and preserving language diversity. He also brought up the issue of protecting citizens' rights when residential housing is built and allocated, establishing correctional centres within the Federal Penitentiary Service and other issues concerning convicted persons.) Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much. I will not list everything you have brought up that needs our joint efforts. All of that is important, and we have to look at the list of diseases for possible release from imprisonment for two categories. I agree with you, we must look into this, so there is nothing to comment on; we need to carefully examine this. As to the new testimony on the past criminal cases you mentioned– a person has served 15 years in prison and then all of a sudden decided to testify– we have to be very careful here. I will not even comment on this, as I am sure you understand what I mean. Thus, everything has to be checked, of course. The only thing to be done in this respect is drawing the attention of the Prosecutor General's Office. I promise that I will do that. Finally, the rights of the indigenous peoples of the North. I absolutely agree this is an issue that requires our constant attention. If you feel we are not doing enough here, I promise to you that such instructions will be prepared. I will get back to this matter and see what has been done and what has not, or has not been done in full, as we had agreed. This is a crucial issue of a principled nature, and everything we agreed on when taking administrative decisions must be enforced. Thank you very much. I think it is time for us to finish. I want to thank you. I understand that you are tired, but you cannot deny that such a substantive discussion of all the issues raised during our conversation today is much needed. I really hope that we will continue this work next year. On my part, I will do everything in my power to fulfil the agreements reached during our discussion today to the fullest possible extent. I hope that we will keep working as constructively and intensely in the upcoming year. I want to thank you for this, for our joint efforts, and wish you all the best in the coming new year. All the best. Goodbye."

The Fund's work prioritises medicine and healthcare, as well as support for Russian pharmaceutical companies. This is particularly important today when Russia and the whole world are battling a dangerous pandemic. It was the Russian Direct Investment Fund that initiated the production of high-precision test systems for diagnosing COVID-19 and medications for treating the coronavirus infection. It made a substantial contribution to developing and marketing Sputnik V, the first registered COVID-19 vaccine in the world. These impressive achievements were made possible by the professionalism and experience of the Fund's staff, skilful managerial and commercial decisions. I hope that the Fund's efforts to promote Russia's economic and social development will remain just as effective as they are today."""
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67324,Address on Heroes of Fatherland Day,2021-12-09T09:00:00Z,NA,,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Citizens of Russia, friends, I would like to congratulate you on Heroes of the Fatherland Day. This day is inseparably linked to the history of our country. It celebrates the heroism of our forefathers and contemporaries, all those whose actions, deeds and life itself were an example of selfless service to the nation. The heroism of these truly great citizens of our Fatherland, their valour and courage reflect the will and character of our people. Throughout our history, this character has always helped us to stand up against the toughest challenges, to strengthen the independence of our state and to effectively repel any attempts to encroach on our territory. The defenders of the Fatherland, our soldiers and officers showed exceptional courage even in the face of the biggest and most merciless threats. They did so during the 1812 battles and during the First World War. In the years of the Great Patriotic War, sweeping, nationwide heroism became an insurmountable obstacle to the enemy. That heroism overturned and destroyed the invaders' plans and the illusion that our country can be conquered. The Soviet people demonstrated unprecedented courage, unity and strong will. We bow to the memory of those who stopped the enemy and routed him in battles near Moscow 80 years ago, in December 1941. We bow to those who brought about the Great Victory and selflessly defended our homeland without regard for their own lives. Every one of them is a hero. Of course, today we also pay tribute to our contemporaries, those who have been awarded high state decorations– the titles of Hero of the Russian Federation and of the Soviet Union, the Order of Glory and St George's Cross– for their outstanding service. We are proud of those who have increased and continue to increase the strength and power of our country through their selfless devotion and who save lives regardless of personal risk. Our special gratitude goes to our medical personnel and other professionals, all those who are keeping alive the glorious traditions of courage, commitment to duty and selflessness. It is extremely important that young people can see and are aware of this continuity, and that love for our country, our native land and our people becomes a reliable and solid foundation in their lives. People of diverse ethnic backgrounds, religions, views and beliefs live in Russia, but all of them are united in their respect for the Heroes of the Fatherland and their heroism, boosting our strength and energy, our desire to keep moving forward and our unity. I firmly believe that this is how it always will be. Congratulations on Heroes of the Fatherland Day!"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67322,Meeting with young scientists,2021-12-08T22:10:00Z,Sirius,"The President held a meeting with participants in the Congress of Young Scientists, which is capping off the Year of Science and Technology in Russia.","The Congress of Young Scientists is being held on December 8–10 at the Sirius Science and Art Park.*** Excerpts from transcript of meeting with young scientists President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, Nice to see you, good evening. Through you, I would like to extend my greetings to all the participants in the Congress of Young Scientists– I was told that almost three thousand people are taking part in it. This is a big team, and the event is quite interesting, as far as I understand. There are meetings where you discuss joint projects, talk about your own, and think about what to do in the future. As you can see, this event is taking place at our Sirius Educational Centre. I hope you like it here. It seems to me that we did the right thing when we established a science and education centre using Olympic legacy facilities. Step by step, gradually, it is expanding and developing. Now it is a federal territory– an additional status that allows all science and education institutions that are created here to develop at the required pace. The Congress of Young Scientists is one of the key events of the Year of Science and Technology. It was our intention to create conditions for young scientists to meet and talk to each other about possible joint projects, as I said before– and not only during the Year, but also after it ends; I hope in the future such conditions will be also be created. I would like to say right off that when we speak about young scientists and young researchers, I want to remind you that in the early 2000s less than 25 percent of our scientists were under the age of 40 whereas now it is almost 50 percent. All that is evidence that regardless of all the difficulties or problems– which exist, and they are numerous, you will obviously tell me about them and I will try to respond– nevertheless, the prestige of research work, the prestige of being a researcher, a scientist, has significantly grown. It is evident from public opinion polls, as well as from the number of young researchers, which has doubled since early 2000s, as I have mentioned. By the way, opinion polls conducted among parents with older schoolchildren indicate that over 60 percent of them would like their children to go into research. It shows that the situation in the country has changed considerably– I will avoid big words like radically, though it has changed considerably and that really makes me happy. Of course, there still remain issues that we need to address together. I know that there are three thousand participants here, it is a big team with people engaged in different areas– cognitive science, history, political science and, I am especially pleased to note, the natural sciences, new materials, artificial intelligence, genetics and so on– all that is represented. I hope you find it both useful and interesting here. I have said that we planned this Congress of Young Scientists as a key event in the Year of Science and Technology, and, of course, we will try to maintain this pace, to retain the impetus and the momentum in the future with a view to boosting interest in research. We will try to draft a programme, probably, for the next decade, to support interest in scientific research. I have repeatedly recalled my last conversation with Daniil Granin, who told me, You should personally pay more attention to science, research and young scientists. In general, society should understand how important this has always been and that it will be even more important in the near future. We are following this instruction. Yes, I am serious: I remember this conversation, and he was very sincere. This was my last meeting with him, and he was certainly right. This is all I would like to say at the beginning. I will be pleased to listen to you and hear your proposals on what we should do in the future to make the situation more stable and better. Incidentally, today's meeting has practical importance for me because very soon we will be holding a joint meeting of the Presidential Council for Science and the State Council. This will give us an opportunity, in cooperation with the people who are in charge of science and higher education and the governors of the regions of the Russian Federation, to formulate the tasks that we will have to address to develop this most important area of endeavour. I think this is all that I wanted to say at the beginning. If you have any ideas, and I am sure you have them, I would be pleased to listen to you, and not only to listen but also to make notes for myself, in order to use them at the event I have just mentioned. Go ahead, please. <…> Vladimir Putin:(responding to a question from Senior Lecturer at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technologies Yury Kostyukevich about sanctions and to a proposal to create a programme to develop scientific tool building in Russia) You have raised an important topic, which is also very complex, and we can approach it from all sides. What can we say for certain? These sanctions and restrictions are introduced under the pretext of ensuring the security of the United States. How does your institute threaten US security? In no way whatsoever. This is complete nonsense. There is only one explanation: an attempt to restrain our development. In the mid-1990s, we were good for everyone and everyone liked us, when we received potatoes as humanitarian aid. Thanks for this. Many did this sincerely, I know, I can say this honestly, because I talked to those people back when I worked in St Petersburg, in Leningrad. However, in general, when Russia began to recover from the challenges facing it, when it restored its constitutional unity, among other things, which was very difficult to do, when it began developing, Russia began to emerge as a competitor, both on the political arena and in international security, as well as in production, science, the energy sector– and this is no longer to their liking. Therefore, our so-called partners began to pursue a containment policy. In fact, the containment policy has been pursued against Russia for centuries; there is nothing new about it. If you look through diplomatic correspondence, for example, from the early 19th century, it looks as if it was written yesterday. I can honestly tell you, as if it was yesterday. It is amazing. You read it, and everything is the same, word for word. Astonishing, but true. Now they are back because they are afraid of competition in all the areas I have just mentioned. Science and education are a sphere of competition and a way to contain Russia's development. This is evident, you and I understand this. Many people all over the world have realised this, and people like you realise this best of all. Science is the future of any country, together with education; it is absolutely obvious that it is already producing practical results that affect our development, as well as the pace and quality of economic growth. So how can we respond to these sanctions? Globally, of course, we should increase our sovereignty. By the way, we are the largest providers of energy resources to the global market, but, for example, oil production-related equipment is largely imported. Could we have done this when we had a chance? Of course, we could have. But we did not pay attention to this because we could not imagine the situation would develop the way it is developing now. By the way, these sanctions are declared for no reason, without any external factors. Sometimes, it appears that various political forces, including those in the United States, are simply competing with one another, showing off their anti-Russia stance and thus scoring domestic political points while simply fighting between themselves. There is nothing good about this; it may be curious, but I do not see how they can get out of this spiral. Of course, they will probably have to do it because the global situation is developing in a particular way. But let it be; this is a different subject. What you mentioned is certainly a highly important aspect of import substitution. We paid hardly any attention to this matter, and this is understandable because, to be honest, we had to deal with import substitution in the defence industry first and foremost. We had to introduce state-of-the-art technologies linked with science in the defence industry. I will not list all of them, but we have invested a lot and have achieved good results. We have accomplished nearly all our tasks. Not all of the goals have been reached; there are thick stacks of documents showing what we still need to do, but a lot has been accomplished. In any event, we have fulfilled all our initial objectives. We have some questions related to micro-electronics and so on, we still have to work on some aspects, this is obvious, but there also some good prospects here. Of course, we should also do what you said. By the way, efforts to boost the competitiveness of various sectors are, in principle, the only way to deal with any similar restrictions. And this means that we need to be open, we need to work with everyone who is prepared for joint work with us. The world is a big place. Clearly, there are leaders in some areas, and they are trying to fence themselves off from us to some extent. It is impossible to quickly do this in the modern world. They invented gunpowder once, but they failed to keep this invention to themselves. The same goes for dynamite. The same with nuclear weapons. They were unable to keep this under wraps. They failed to do it, and it is simply impossible, and in the modern world it is absolutely unimaginable. This is why we have to be open and work with everyone. But, of course, we have to take specific steps to expand our sovereignty in the sphere of science and instrument engineering. That is the issue you raised here. I will be happy to take your roadmap. <…> Vladimir Putin:(replying to a question from Andrei Abramov, Head of the Laboratory of Cell Physiology and Pathology at Oryol Turgenev State University, about mega-grants) First of all, I would like to say that it was[Presidential Aide] Andrei Fursenko and I who came up with these mega-grants. He was responsible for implementing the idea, and as far as I know, it is running very well. Indeed, many researchers and scientists, all of them top-class ones, have been engaged. Some of them were winners of various prizes, including the Nobel Prize, and some won the Nobel Prize after the implementation of the mega-grants. I believe that it is one of our successful projects. It is notable that there were over 100 Russian scientists– I think there were 104 of them– 44 American scientists and dozens from European countries, 15 or even 20. They worked all over Russia. I believe they were involved in more than 300 projects in 36 Russian regions, from the Far East, including– you may be surprised– Yakutia, as well as Moscow, St Petersburg, Tomsk, Novosibirsk and other cities. It really is a very good programme. And, quite unexpectedly for me, the outlays went down from 150 million rubles to 90 million, for some reason. On the other hand, they are not planning to further reduce spending. And the duration has been reduced to three years. I know that similar programmes are underway in some European countries; the timeframe is five years with a five-year extension. Of course, we should do it again. We should also increase the size of the mega-grant if we want it to be regarded as a mega-grant and so that it will be attractive for top-notch researchers. And you are absolutely correct, of course; the participants should be able to see that the project has a future. I fully agree with you that in some instances the initial stage should be increased to five years, with a definite extension period of not five but three years. We will try to move in this direction. I believe that this is a very important issue. The project is successful, overall, and it should continue running in the same successful mode. We will certainly take up this matter. I fully agree that the size of the mega-grant should be increased, and its duration should be extended. <…> Vladimir Putin:(on the proposal by Ivan Uteshev, a student at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, to organise tours to the Vostochny Space Centre in the Far East) It was my idea to build a cosmodrome there. At first nobody wanted it, then there was no money; they picked one site, then another. Then I went there in 2009 and made the final decision to pick that site. The first thing that needs to be done– well, not the very first thing, but what needs to be done to develop special tourism, among other things, is to build a runway, a local airport. It is quite difficult to get there at the moment: either by helicopter from the airport, or a very long drive. When I was there the last time, it was impossible to leave by helicopter because of bad weather. It took us all night to drive back; I arrived at the airport by 6 in the morning. So, there are some problems, but they are temporary. The launch pad is operating already; soon it will support heavy equipment. Work is underway, and the runway is under construction. It will be easier when all is done. I will look into it, of course; we do need to promote this destination. I did not even know that there were tours there. We need to do it, finish the construction of the town of Tsiolkovsky, and make it modern. I am sure it will be an up-to-date city with good social infrastructure so that it would be interesting for people to live and work there, and so that young people and young families could work there and live comfortably. Plans call for fully implementing all this. <…> Vladimir Putin:(commenting on the proposal by Alexander Chubrik, a post-graduate student at the National University of Science and Technology MISIS, to build upon and support outstanding initiatives voiced during the Year of Science and Technology and on instituting a Decade of Science) Once I noted in passing that, technically speaking, the Year of Science is ending, but work continues in this direction. And I said that we were thinking about how exactly to continue specific trends set by this Year of Science. We will see whether this will be a decade or a five-year period, but it is absolutely clear that we need to continue working towards the goals of various Year of Science events. But this is a good idea, and I completely support it. We will think about how to continue this work, and we will discuss ways of transforming certain aspects and using them more widely. We will certainly deal with this matter. As far as I know, our famous Nobel Prize recipient Vitaly Ginzburg once noted that the ability to ask the right questions was the most important thing in science. And I believe that our meeting has taken place along precisely these lines. I have listened to your questions, and all of them have been asked correctly. This allows us(when I say""us,"" I mean my colleagues in the regions, in the Government of the Russian Federation and the Presidential Executive Office) to more precisely focus on subsequent steps to develop this highly important sphere, namely, research activity, and on support for all scientists, research projects and young scientists in particular. I would like to thank you for this and to wish you every success."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67337,Greetings to participants and guests of the National Sports Award ceremony,2021-12-08T19:00:00Z,NA,Vladimir Putin sent a message of greetings to the participants and guests of the National Sports Award ceremony.,"The message reads, in part:""Today, the National Sports Award will be presented to talented athletes who won prestigious international competitions, their coaches, tutors, specialists, media representatives, sponsors and philanthropists. I offer my heartfelt congratulations to the winners of this high and well-deserved award. I firmly believe that such large-scale festive events are very important. They offer an excellent opportunity to express sincere and deep appreciation to those who contribute their efforts and energy to the development of the Olympic and Paralympic movements, promotion of values of fitness and active and healthy lifestyle, those who inspire others to conquer new summits and are a role model for young people. On my part I will stress that the state will continue to create comfortable and favourable conditions for training future champions and record holders, constantly focus on improving sports infrastructure, and, of course, keep supporting athletes and upholding their rights and interests."""
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67320,Joint news conference with Prime Minister of Greece Kyriakos Mitsotakis,2021-12-08T17:10:00Z,Sochi,"Following Russian-Greek talks, Vladimir Putin and Kyriakos Mitsotakis gave statements for the press and replied to journalists' questions.","President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, colleagues, We are pleased to welcome the Prime Minister of the Hellenic Republic to Russia. I appreciate that, despite the difficult epidemiological situation, my colleague nevertheless accepted our invitation to visit Russia. It is symbolic that this visit is taking place during the 200th anniversary of the Greek Revolution, an event that marked the beginning of an eight-year struggle for independence, which resulted in Greece becoming a free and independent state. Allow me to remind you that Russia fully supported Greece's national liberation movement and was the first to recognize the country's independence in 1828. To this day, the peoples of the two countries are linked by strong friendship and deep cultural and humanitarian ties. Our relationship is traditionally evolving in the spirit of neighbourliness, respect and mutual consideration for each other's interests; it embraces numerous areas of cooperation; it is a mutually beneficial partnership. Today's meeting with Mr Mitsotakis took place in exactly this kind of atmosphere. It was very substantive and productive. We discussed at length the most important current aspects of our cooperation. I am confident that the comprehensive Joint Action Plan between Russia and Greece for 2022–2024 will give a fresh impetus to our bilateral relations while perfectly meeting the goals we have set ourselves. The Greek Prime Minister's visit coincided with the signing of a number of agreements, in particular, those covering maritime security, tourism, finance, and high technology. Overall, I would like to note with satisfaction that Russian-Greek ties have not lost momentum and continue to grow stronger consistently in all areas. In particular, despite the difficulties caused by the coronavirus pandemic, our mutual trade grew by 56 percent in the first nine months of this year. Note that it decreased by 37 percent last year and has gained 56 percent by now, which is $3.2 billion. We have almost reached pre-pandemic levels. Russia's investments in Greece total almost $650 million. In addition, our companies are interested in implementing more joint projects, including those on developing infrastructure on Greek territory and building up investment in other branches of the economy. We are hoping for reciprocal interest and assistance from the Greek authorities. The Mixed Commission on Economic, Industrial, Scientific and Technical Cooperation promotes the diversification of trade and investment exchanges. Its regular, 13th session took place in Moscow the other day. The Russian-Hellenic Business Council actively promotes direct contacts between businesses. Incidentally, Greek business people always attend the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, and we will be happy, as I told our guest today, to see our Greek partners at this event or the Eastern Economic Forum. During the talks, I also expressed hope that Greece would support Moscow's application for hosting the EXPO-2030 universal world fair. I would like to emphasise that our country has been an invariable participant in these fairs for 170 years now. Naturally, the talks focused on key areas of bilateral cooperation, such as energy. Russia meets over 40 percent of Greece's demand in natural gas. It supplies it, in part, via the Turkish Stream pipeline. This year, we increased our exports by over 12 percent to 3 billion cubic metres. Importantly, Russia always honestly and fully complies with its contractual commitments with Greece and other European partners and consumers. Naturally, we will continue our guaranteed, failsafe energy supplies. Moreover, we are willing to enhance our cooperation in this area, in part with due account for the growing role of gas as the cleanest, eco-friendly fuel. We considered matters related to our interaction in the field of emergency response. Last summer, as you know, Greece faced several large-scale forest fires, and Russia could not remain indifferent, although at that time, Russia was also struggling with fires in the vast forests of Siberia and the Far East. Russia sent specially equipped aircraft to fight fires in Greece, and our specialists worked there for some time. That involved both licensed equipment and equipment supplied to Greece on special terms. Mr Prime Minister and I agreed to provide full support for the development of tourism, given that Greece with its historical, cultural and religious landmarks, as well as resorts, is very popular with Russian citizens. We are grateful to the Greek authorities for the decision to recognise Russian Sputnik V vaccination certificates. It is very important that Greece and Russia place great importance on the preservation of their rich historical heritage, and maintain the historic and cultural sites that are important for our countries, and we also spoke about this today. In particular, I informed the Greek Prime Minister of our decision to transfer to the Hellenic Republic the archives of that country's Jewish communities, which the Nazis moved to Germany during World War II, and which have been in Moscow since 1945. The necessary formalities for this transfer should be completed shortly. The Russia-Greece Cross Year of History has been extended until mid-2022 by mutual agreement. The Cross Year events– more than 140 have been planned– have aroused great interest. We agreed to continue the practice of holding thematic years, which has shown such good results. When discussing the international agenda, we touched on the outlook for further work on EU-Russia relations, the situation in the Balkans and in the Eastern Mediterranean. As for the problem of Cyprus, we once again reaffirmed Russia's support for achieving a comprehensive, just and viable settlement within the international legal framework established by UN Security Council resolutions, which would reunite Cyprus as a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation with a single international legal status, sovereignty and citizenship. In conclusion, I would like to express my gratitude to Mr Mitsotakis for our productive joint work today. Taking this opportunity, I would like to extend my Christmas and New Year greetings to the Prime Minister of Greece and to all the friendly Greek people. Thank you. Prime Minister of Greece Kyriakos Mitsotakis Mitsotakis KyriakosPrime Minister of Greece(retranslated): Thank you, Mr President. Today, we had an opportunity to meet and discuss our bilateral relations and our prospects in a sincere and productive atmosphere. Thank you for this, and thank you again for your hospitality. I assure you that I consider this meeting to be yet another step towards strengthening relations between our nations and yet another opportunity for expanding relations between our governments on a foundation of mutual respect and mutual benefit. I would like to recall that initially I was to come to Russia in May 2020 for the celebrations of the 75th anniversary of the Victory over Nazism, but I could not attend due to the pandemic. This is why our meeting is taking place now, because the conditions for it are favourable, despite the persisting problems. Our meeting coincides with the 200th anniversary of our liberation from the Ottoman yoke. We are referring to the struggle in which co-religionist Russia played a decisive role, a role that the Greeks will never forget and have always recognised. It would be natural for me to list, together with Mr President, the many things that have linked us over the centuries. We can recall our history and culture that are largely common to both states. This is facilitated by the successful joint organisation of the Cross-Year of Greek and Russian History, which we have decided to extend, as well as the recent 13th meeting of the intergovernmental commission in Moscow. This was attended by Greek co-chair, First Deputy Foreign Minister Giorgos Varvitsiotis. The participants signed a protocol that will promote our cooperation in many areas. We are content with the three agreements within it that enhance our bilateral contractual legal base. The President of Russia and I adopted a joint plan of action for 2022–2024. It establishes the main areas of cooperation for the next three years. It is an important document with a bearing on many bilateral issues. However, we agree that there are also other spheres of cooperation we can discuss, primarily our humanitarian contacts. Mr President mentioned the devastating wildfires, which, among other things, clearly show that we are faced with the consequences of an aggravated climatic situation, and we saw what the environmental implications can be. I thank the President and the Russian Federation for providing us with direct help in a difficult situation. This gave us a reason to consider and understand how important it is to strengthen cooperation in combating natural disasters, in particular, wildfires. We discussed, among other things, buying two or more pieces of firefighting equipment from Russia. We also discussed issues related to countering the common threat presented by the pandemic. We discussed not only ways to interact in healthcare, but also related economic measures in order to minimise the fallout of the pandemic for society. We have also discussed energy issues. For more than 30 years now, Russia has been supplying natural gas to Greece. For us, Russia is a stable and valuable partner, and the President put it very well when he said that this is an entire large-scale dimension of our interaction, which we highly appreciate. It is very important for us to comply with the relevant arrangements and terms and conditions, and stick to these agreements. We discussed the prospects for Greek investment in the Russian Federation and Russian investment in Greece, primarily, in tourism, and what can and should be done to increase the tourist flow next year. We discussed and noted the signing of a programme for 2022–2024 tourism cooperation. I had the opportunity to discuss regional international cooperation and developments in the Eastern Mediterranean. I noted that, unfortunately, Turkey has recently been resorting to very aggressive rhetoric. Greece is open to dialogue based on international law and the Convention on the Law of the Sea, which are of fundamental importance if we want to reach any agreement. With regard to the Cyprus issue, I expressed my appreciation for Russia's consistent and constructive stance. It is an extremely important national priority for Greece. I reiterated our commitment to the goal of developing a viable solution and enshrining it in a Security Council resolution. This resolution cannot be drafted without the abolition of the anachronistic guarantee system and without the withdrawal of Turkish occupation forces. The two-zone and bi-communal structure must be preserved on the island, and all issues must be resolved based on reciprocity and mutual respect. Varosha is another issue that we touched on when we discussed Cyprus. I will emphasise that if Turkey keeps talking about populating this abandoned town, it will ruin prospects for any progress on this track. Our dialogue was direct and sincere. We note the major challenges we are facing, and we always have an urgent need for direct communication because the absence of communication does not lead to anything good. Russia is part of the European security architecture and for this reason, many countries are interested in its participation in a dialogue, especially between Russia and the EU and Russia and NATO. I am also concerned about the exacerbation of tensions in Ukraine and still hope that there will be no serious clashes. After all, the Minsk agreements must be observed, among other accords. Let us not forget that Greece is interested in a settlement, and non-aggravation of the crisis in that region because many Greeks, our compatriots, live there. We also exchanged views on the situation in the West Balkans and spoke about Libya at length. We agreed that Libya should use this opportunity to hold elections. In conclusion, I would like to say that the level of this meeting, of our dialogue, reflects Russia's attitude towards our country and your personal attitude towards me. I think that despite the passage of time, over the centuries, one thing is immutable: Greece continues to be in the heart of Russia. As I have said, we remember Alexander Pushkin who chanted the praises of the 1821 revolution by writing the verse,""Revolt, Oh Greece, revolt."" We should also recall Ioannis Kapodistrias who became a landmark figure in the history of our two countries. Let us not forget the dozens, hundreds and even thousands of young people who now live in Russia, in the south of Russia, who are our compatriots, our brothers. At one time, they were probably driven out of other countries, but they found a second homeland in Russia, in the south of Russia. We should also mention the young people who study Greek. I will also mention Fyodor Yurchikhin, a cosmonaut who made five space flights, and another Fyodor, our maestro Teodor Currentzis who guides us in the friendly and interesting world of music with his conductor's baton. Relations between Greece and Russia and between Greeks and Russians continue. They are in the past, present and future. I would like to thank you once again for your hospitality, intensive talks, your time and the exceptional conversation. Thank you. Question(retranslated): Russia is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and plays a certain decisive and important part in decision-making. How do you assess the situation in the Aegean Sea region and in the Eastern Mediterranean in general? Vladimir Putin: The Prime Minister has just said that we discussed this matter in detail. We believe that the issues arising there, controversial as they may be, will be addressed in the course of a dialogue. I believe that the Greek side is committed to this. We support it in every possible way and, frankly, we do not see any obstacles to starting this dialogue. I just stated my position on the Cyprus problem. With regard to other, smaller island-specific issues, and the like– I think these kinds of problems have always been resolved on a bilateral basis and they can be resolved in that manner going forward. With regard to the Eastern Mediterranean, including Libya, we covered this in great detail. We believe that the planned domestic political events– the elections– will be held as planned and will stabilise the situation in that country. We maintain contact on this issue with all stakeholders, including the leading EU countries and the Republic of Turkey. I hope that here, too, solutions will be found that will suit everyone and would lead to lasting stabilisation. Kyriakos Mitsotakis: I had the opportunity to inform the President about the state of the Greek-Turkish dialogue, the state of relations between our countries, and the framework of our current agreements. We see certain things differently. One of the issues that worries us and one of the differences is border delimitation, but these issues need to be addressed under international law and the Convention on the Law of the Sea– as with other situations, in the case of the Republic of Egypt, for example. There is one approach that we want and encourage the parties to use: to conduct an energetic dialogue with all stakeholders and the non-violation of territorial integrity and the sovereign rights of our countries, including when addressing the Cyprus issue. To reiterate, we thank Russia for its firm position on the Cyprus issue and the implementation of the resolutions that were reached earlier, since our positions– Russia's and ours– are absolutely clear and not subject to change. Question: Ksenia Golovanova, Interfax news agency. I have a question for both President Putin and Prime Minister Mitsotakis. Both of you have praised Russian-Greek relations. However, we all know that Greece is a member of the EU and NATO, an alliance that is pursuing a clearly confrontational policy towards Russia today. Is there a threat that this situation could damage bilateral relations? And in a follow-up to this topic, a question for Mr President. Yesterday you talked to the President of the United States, a country with tremendous influence over both NATO and the EU countries. You spoke about""red lines"" and instructed your teams to analyse those""red lines."" What do you think of the outcome of the talks? Do you believe they can pave the way to decreasing the intensity of the confrontation with the West? Vladimir Putin: They can do what? Ksenia Golovanova: Pave the way to decreasing the intensity of the confrontation with the West today. Vladimir Putin: The first part of the question concerns Greece's membership in two blocs: the North Atlantic military bloc, NATO, and the political and economic association, the European Union. These are different matters, we have never objected to the presence of our nearest neighbours and partners in political and economic associations. On the contrary, we think this is, to a certain degree, a big plus, meaning those deep historical roots that bind the peoples of Russia and Greece. I believe Greece has always advocated and will advocate, as much as possible, a balanced and objective position on a number of issues pertaining to Russia-EU interaction, as has been the case for many decades. As for NATO, it is a military bloc. Regretfully, the NATO bloc is pursuing a confrontational line towards Russia. The latest issues are seemingly technical, but nevertheless, the expulsion of diplomats, which ultimately made us close the respective NATO agency in Moscow, shows that the alliance is unfriendly to us, to put it mildly. In addition, they declare Russia is an adversary. There is nothing good about this, we are not striving for any confrontation with anyone. We hope that in this respect Greece will hold a position of containment, as they say. But in any case, Greece's membership in either association has never impeded the progress of our bilateral relations. I hope this will continue, and we will use the experience of our Greek friends for them to play a positive role in relations with the two associations. To be honest, I do not see any major problems here. With regard to the conversation with the US President, yesterday, Mr Ushakov, my aide in charge of international affairs, spoke in detail about the issues covered during the talks. Today, I also briefed my colleague from Greece in general terms. Indeed, we discussed regional issues, the conflict in southeastern Ukraine and one more issue that is related to this situation and is very sensitive for us– we touched on it too– namely, the eastward expansion of NATO, including by way of Ukraine joining it. This is one of the key issues behind ensuring Russia's security in the medium term and even for the strategic outlook. We speak about this constantly and publicly, and let our partners know that this is unacceptable for us. One thesis is very straightforward, and we discussed it yesterday: no doubt, every country is entitled to choose the most acceptable way to ensure its security, but this should be done so as not to encroach on the interests of other parties and not to undermine the security of other countries, in this case, Russia. You know, this is the same as in relations between people: freedom is, of course, a God-given right, and it should be unrestricted, but only as long as it does not interfere with another person's freedom. And this is where mutual restrictions should come into force. We believe that while ensuring security, security must be global and cover equally everyone, so this is a topic of a separate conversation. We agreed that we will continue this discussion and do so substantively. We will exchange views on this matter shortly. Russia will put its thoughts down on paper literally within a few days, maybe within a week. We will submit them to the American side for review. We agreed to set up a corresponding body which would deal with this professionally. We spoke in detail about cybersecurity, ensuring security in this area, and stated that we managed to make significant progress on it following our meeting in Geneva. A constructive dialogue has been established. It is under way, and corresponding bodies have been created. Information exchange has been established, which is positive and yields positive results. We discussed the Iranian problem. I hope that the President of Iran will accept my invitation and visit Russia early next year. Of course, we will inform our Iranian friends and partners in detail about our dialogue with the Americans on these matters, and we will continue to discuss this issue during the Iranian President's possible visit to Russia early next year. We discussed a number of other issues regarding normalisation of diplomatic ties and so on. We talked for a long time and covered all these issues in detail. The conversation lasted for more than two hours; I cannot say exactly how long. I want to stress once again: the conversation was very open, substantive and, I would say, constructive. In any case, I hope that this is how the American side assesses the results of our meeting. We have the opportunity to continue this dialogue, and I think this is the most important thing there is. Kyriakos Mitsotakis(retranslated): Indeed, Greece has been an EU member for 40 years now and is a NATO member as well. It has largely strengthened its positions in these structures and other organisations, but this does not mean at all that we do not want to develop relations with the Russian Federation. Quite the contrary: there are many areas where we can strengthen and develop our cooperation and they will by no means necessarily directly affect Russia's relations with NATO or the EU. I would also like to thank you, Mr President, for providing me with detailed analytical information about your conversation with the US President. This conversation lasted for over two hours and I consider this a positive fact. Our common goal is to draft and adopt a certain roadmap for reducing tensions, because if they exist, they can and will escalate and set us back many decades, especially in the event of crises. There is a huge amount of difficulties and problems that we are facing and must resolve. It is necessary to preserve communication channels, to be sincere and straight, and to try to settle all problems in this spirit and with the right approach. Question: Andrei Kolesnikov, Kommersant newspaper. Mr President, can you dispel the main doubt: Is Russia still going to attack Ukraine or not? If not, can you explain why? And if yes, the answer is even more urgently needed. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: This is a question designed to provoke. Russia pursues a peaceful foreign policy but it has the right to ensure its security, as I have already said, in the medium to longer term. We are discussing this issue with our partners– all our partners, including my partner in conversation yesterday, US President Joseph Biden. We are bound to be concerned over the prospect of Ukraine's potential accession to NATO because this will be followed by the deployment of corresponding troop contingents, bases and weapons that threaten us. I have already described this in broad strokes, replying to the previous question. I will flesh out my claims in response to your question. I think it will be enough of an answer for today. We proceed from the premise that our concerns will be heard, at least this time. That said, over the past few decades we continuously expressed our concerns and asked our partners to abstain from certain actions but nonetheless NATO infrastructure inevitably moved closer to our borders and now we are seeing Mk 14 missile defence systems in Poland and Romania. We have every reason to believe that the same will happen in Ukraine if NATO accepts it. How can we not think about this? Looking on helplessly at what is happening there would be simply criminal negligence. This is exactly what our talks dealt with. Let me repeat again: we have agreed to create a relevant structure that will be in a position to address this problem practically and thoroughly and will present relevant proposals. I must admit that the US President put forward this idea. I agreed with it and said that we will soon submit our ideas and proposals in this regard. It is probably premature to speak about these proposals until we formulate them. That said, I realise that they understandably evoke heightened interest among the Russian, European and international public. We will, of course, do this as publicly as we can. "

A package of documents was adopted following the meeting, including a Joint Plan of Action between the Russian Federation and the Hellenic Republic for 2022–2024. The package includes a protocol on introducing amendments to the intergovernmental agreement on preventing incidents at sea beyond respective territorial waters of April 10, 1991, as well as memorandums of understanding on cooperation in developing and using petawatt and exawatt laser infrastructure, and on technical cooperation between the tax services of both states in administering taxes. In addition, the Federal Agency for Tourism (Russian Federation) and the Ministry of Tourism of the Hellenic Republic signed a programme of joint action on developing tourism in 2022–2024. * * * Beginning of Russian-Greek talks President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, good afternoon. I am happy to see you. Thank you very much for accepting the invitation and coming to Russia. Opening our meeting, I would like to say a few traditional but nevertheless very important things. They have to do with the special affinity between our peoples, with our history – 2021 is the Russia-Greece Cross Year of History, a project that also coincided with the 200th anniversary of the Greek Revolution. As you know, Russia made a significant contribution to the achievement of the goals that the Greek people had. I would like to note that our ties are developing rather positively today. Whereas last year we saw a decline in trade of about 35 percent, this year we recorded an increase of 56 percent. We have practically reached the pre-pandemic level. I know that you have met with Russian Government members, and good agreements have been reached. We are close to signing the relevant agreements. We will certainly discuss all these matters, and others that are of interest to us, during today's meeting, formally as well as informally over lunch. Welcome. Prime Minister of Greece Kyriakos Mitsotakis (retranslated): Mr President, Thank you very much for the invitation to visit Sochi and to meet with you, and for your warm welcome. I am pleased to visit the Russian Federation during this significant year, the year of the 200th anniversary of the Greek Revolution – an event that inextricably links our two countries. That revolution led to the creation of an independent Greek state, and we never forget that Russia played a significant role. The great powers of that time helped Greece find the strength to become a modern independent state. Our agreement to hold the Russia-Greece Cross Year of History in 2020–2021 was of great importance. The project can serve as an impetus and springboard for further strengthening our close mutual relations, including economic ties, as the Greek economy has grown significantly of late, despite the pandemic conditions we are facing. And, accordingly, there are good prospects for increasing our bilateral trade and economic cooperation, as well as developing cooperation in the field of tourism. I also believe that we will further discuss a number of issues, including some matters on the regional agenda, given that Russia is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and plays a significant role in many developments – almost all of them – in the region and in the world. Thank you once again for giving me an opportunity to visit Sochi, a region that is home to many of my compatriots, Russian citizens of Greek descent. This is not my first visit to Sochi, but nevertheless, it is my first visit as Prime Minister. I was in Sochi 30 years ago as part of my father's delegation when he visited the Soviet Union. He also visited Anapa and Gelendzhik that time. So, thank you very much. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67315,Meeting with US President Joseph Biden,2021-12-07T20:15:00Z,Sochi,Vladimir Putin had a lengthy conversation with President of the United States of America Joseph Biden.,"In particular, the two presidents discussed the outcomes of the June 2021 Russian-American summit in Geneva, noting the importance of consistent progress in implementing the agreements reached at the highest level and preserving the Geneva spirit when discussing bilateral relations or other issues that may arise between Russia and the United States. In this context, the presidents recalled the fact that the two countries were allies during World War II. They emphasised the need to remember the sacrifices made at that time, while this allied relationship must set an example for establishing contacts and working together in today's reality. The intra-Ukrainian crisis and the lack of progress in implementing the 2015 Minsk agreements, which have no alternative for bringing about a peaceful resolution, topped the conversation's agenda. The President of Russia shared specific examples to illustrate the destructive nature of Kiev's policy to dismantle the Minsk Package of Measures and the agreements reached within the Normandy format. He also expressed serious concern about Kiev's provocative actions against Donbass. Joseph Biden, in turn, focused on what he described as""threatening"" movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border and outlined the sanctions the United States and its allies would be ready to impose should the situation escalate any further. In response, Vladimir Putin warned against shifting the responsibility on Russia, since it was NATO that was undertaking dangerous attempts to gain a foothold on Ukrainian territory, and building up its military capabilities along the Russian border. It is for this reason that Russia is eager to obtain reliable, legally binding guaranties ruling out the eventuality of NATO's eastward expansion and the deployment of offensive weapons systems in the countries neighbouring Russia. The two leaders agreed to instruct their representatives to engage in meaningful consultations on these sensitive matters. The meeting also included an exchange of views on information security, with both sides emphasising the importance of the ongoing dialogue on this topic. They expressed their readiness to continue working together on practical matters related to combatting cybercrime through the criminal justice process, as well as using technical intelligence. They discussed the developments around the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on the Iranian nuclear programme. The Russian President noted the importance of ensuring that it is fully implemented in its original version. The leaders expressed hope that the talks on this issue, which resumed in late November in Vienna, will be constructive, and will bring about solutions that would be acceptable to all the parties involved. The two presidents discussed the bilateral agenda, stating that the level of cooperation between their countries remains unsatisfactory. In particular, this situation manifests itself in the challenges faced by the scaled-down diplomatic missions of the two countries. Vladimir Putin stressed that all this results from the policy line adopted by the US authorities as far back as five years ago, when they started enacting far-reaching restrictions, bans and mass expulsions of Russian diplomats, compelling Russia to respond in kind. Russia proposed resetting all the existing restrictions regarding the functioning of the diplomatic missions, which could help bring other aspects of diplomatic relations between the two countries back to normal. The presidents expressed the view that, considering their special responsibility for international security and stability, Russia and the United States will continue their dialogue and the necessary contacts. Overall, the conversation took place in a sincere and business-like atmosphere."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67314,Meeting on economic issues,2021-12-07T17:50:00Z,Sochi,"The President held a meeting, via videoconference, on economic issues.","The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Anton Vaino, First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov, Presidential Aide Maxim Oreshkin, Minister of Economic Development Maxim Reshetnikov, Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov and Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, Today I would like to revisit the topic that we discussed a week ago at VTB Capital Russia Calling! Investment Forum. I am referring to the current situation in the Russian economy. I would like to note that recent economic trends have been generally positive. After ten months of this year, as you know, Russia's gross domestic product grew by 4.6 percent. This is not the fastest growth in the world, you are well aware of this, but it is not the slowest either, and given today's circumstances, for the Russian economy, this is a good indicator. Investment added 7.6 percent over three quarters of 2021, which is also good. Please note that this is happening – just as the volume of lending in the economy has not decreased either (Maxim Oreshkin reported all this data to me today) – despite the increase in the Central Bank's key interest rate. Employment in Russia has reached 72.3 million people, which corresponds to the second half of the pre-COVID year 2019. We still have many unresolved problems, including some new ones we will need to address. Nevertheless, I must note that the Government's primary task this year – to revive the labour market – has been completed. As for the coming year, I would like to highlight a number of tasks the Government and the Bank of Russia will need to specifically focus on. First, rising inflation, which was 8.4 percent as of late November, is the main problem plaguing the economy and consumers. It is imperative to bring inflation back to the benchmark level of 4 percent in 2022. What do I consider important here? I mentioned that prices are going up all over the world. We are well aware of this. The main reason for this is the extremely soft budgetary policy in a number of developed economies. With that in mind, we must implement effective mechanisms to counter inflation. Please focus on increasing the supply of goods, primarily food, and services in the domestic market. The Government is taking strong measures; I hope they will be effective like they were in other areas earlier. Among other things, the production and supply of meat, sugar and vegetables should significantly increase in 2022. Second, it is necessary to increase real disposable individual incomes at a rate that is not lower than the estimated level, that is, not lower than 2.5 percent. I mean real inflation-adjusted incomes. We have agreed to expand the Government measures to support the people as more financial opportunities become available based on federal budget resources, which look good now and in the long term, for the next year. Today, I expect to hear your proposals on an economic policy that will make it possible to achieve sustainable real growth of wages and entrepreneurial revenue. With regard to the growth of real wages, we see positive dynamics, but of course, we must monitor this situation very carefully and maintain these dynamics. Third, as I mentioned at the Russia Calling! forum, our strategic goal regarding the growth of individual incomes, the implementation of national projects and programmes is to ensure long-term sustainable economic growth, or as your colleagues, analysts, say, to increase potential growth rates. I want the Government to analyse the main factors that hold back the long-term growth of the economy and propose additional measures to speed it up. It is important to maintain high rates of economic growth going forward. I want to note that this task will have to be addressed amid the challenging circumstances of the pandemic and the spread of a new coronavirus variant, even though some say, it is not as bad as the previous one and some experts even call it a ""living vaccination."" But let's not get ahead of ourselves. In any case, the markets have rebounded, and fears about the new variant have turned out to be premature. Still, we must proceed based on our experience of the previous 18 months. We are aware of the pitfalls, and I think we have a pretty good idea of what they can do to the economy. I look forward to hearing your reports on this matter soon. Let's move on to the proposed agenda. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67313,Launching passenger service on a new section of the Moscow Metro's Big Circle Line,2021-12-07T16:35:00Z,Sochi,The President took part in a videoconference ceremony to launch passenger service on a new section of the Moscow Metro's Big Circle Line.,"The new section connects Mnyovniki and Kakhovkaya stations, running through the city's Western, Southwestern and Southern administrative areas, and in addition to new stations also includes a section of the Kakhovskaya line, currently under reconstruction. When completed, the Big Circle Line, Moscow's most ambitious metro construction project, will be 70 kilometres long, and its interchange circuit will have 31 stations and will link operational and planned metro lines. The fully operational Big Circle Line will considerably expand the range of metro route options, will provide for more comfortable and convenient rides, and metro carriages will be less congested during peak hours.*** President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Sobyanin, friends, good afternoon! Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin Sobyanin SergeiMoscow Mayor: Good afternoon, Mr President! Vladimir Putin: I am happy to see all of you. Today, a very important and exciting event is taking place in Moscow– we launch passenger service on a new section of the Moscow Metro's Big Circle Line. Indeed, for the first time in history of domestic metro engineering, ten stations are being launched at once. Naturally, I would like to congratulate all of you on this event, this success. Sergei Sobyanin: Thank you, Mr President! Vladimir Putin: The new stations of the Big Circle Line will definitely considerably improve transport access to many parts in the west and south of Moscow. Mr Sobyanin and I have discussed this many times. Public transport trips will become faster and more convenient for millions of people and the metro radial lines will carry less burden. It would be no exaggeration to say that the city's entire rhythm will change. I know that, as of today, 22 stations on the Big Circle Line are now open. The track is almost 44 km long, and the length of single track tunnels is 90 km. This is an enormous amount of work. After the entire line is completed and the Big Circle Line loops– 70 kilometres of track– it will be the world's longest metro circle line. Muscovites have every reason to take pride in the accomplishment of such a large-scale, much needed project. I know that every municipal service was involved in carrying out this project. Thousands of specialists– builders, designers, architects, engineers and technicians– were involved in it. I sincerely congratulate you on this achievement and thank you for your hard work, the results of your hard work. You have done an enormous job through a concerted effort and resolved the most sophisticated technical problems. This entailed building a new line in a dense city environment with many connections and crossings with the existing radial lines. Notably, today's event is an important milestone in the development of the Moscow Metro, the entire metro system. In the past decade, together with this new section of the Big Circle Line, the Moscow Metro got 100 new stations and the Moscow Central Circle. Mr Sobyanin, we opened the MCC in 2016, correct? Sergei Sobyanin: Yes, Mr President, you and I opened it then. Today, half a million passengers use it on a daily basis. It is an enormous and hugely popular service. Vladimir Putin: The metro lines have expanded by 50 percent, as you reported to me recently. Of course, this fast pace of construction should continue into the future. You know, I remember how 10 years ago, maybe even more, you and I were discussing the problems facing Moscow, which is a vast metropolitan area. Back then, we were talking about how transport and transport interchanges were a key challenge for Moscow, Muscovites, and city officials. Absolutely one of the main challenges, if not the most important one. Making the city more modern and dynamic was a critically important task. Mr Sobyanin, today I can say with good reason that you and your team have been up to this task. In closing, I would like to thank everyone involved in the construction of the Moscow Metro. Much work lies ahead. I will not give you any numbers. I will leave it to the Mayor to describe what the future holds for Muscovites in terms of transport services, including the metro. I will not give these numbers– though they are quite impressive– and I wish you every success and all the best. Please, Mr Sobyanin. Mayor of Moscow Sergei Sobyanin: Thank you, Mr President. Back then you supported the strategy for Central Transport Hub development as the Moscow transport hub is now called; this was the name when we were considering it, but it was renamed the Central Transport Hub in view of its importance. Over 60 percent of all Russian passengers pass through here; this is a huge number. It includes suburban railways, the Moscow Central Diameters(MCDs), roads, air routes and so on. The Moscow Metro's Big Circle Line is the pivotal project of the transport hub. It absorbs and brings together all these transport modes because the Big Circle Line will offer interchanges to 44 different directions, including commuter railway routes, the MCC and MCD as well as radial metro lines. It is the key project which is, along with the MCC, the new frame for Moscow's entire transport system and the Moscow transport hub. It is the most difficult and most needed. It is difficult because, as you said, almost an entire new underground city is being built under Moscow: overall, 150 kilometres of tunnels will be bored. All this construction is being done in a living city, crossing operating railways and metro lines, as well as vehicle thoroughfares. Roads are sometimes narrowed during construction which causes problems. All this obviously creates incredible complexity– technological, organisational and even political complexity. I can report to you that two thirds, even more, 70 percent of this truly giant and very complicated project has been completed. Thirty percent is left– that's nine stations that we will certainly complete, for the most part, next year. I believe that in 2023 the new circle line will be completed and will start operating at full capacity. Mr President, I would like to thank you for your continuous attention and support for this project, and not just this, but in general, for the comprehensive development of Moscow metropolitan area's transport system and the Central Transport Hub. Of course, I would also like to thank all those who worked hard on this project, especially the metro construction workers who are here and who work on this unique project, as well as the Moscow Metropolitan and the workers that are playing an active role in its development. Later, they will have the challenge of operating one of the world's biggest metro systems. Thank you, Mr President! Please allow me to launch the service! Vladimir Putin: Go ahead, please! Sergey Sobyanin: Chief of the Metropolitan,launch the new service! Thank you, Mr President! With you permission we will take a ride. Vladimir Putin: Yes, thank you once again. Mr Sobyanin was too modest. By 2023, Moscow will have 293 stations and a network of lines with an overall length of 530 kilometres. The Mayor is cautious and speaks only about the near future, but as I understand it, 14 more stations will be put into service before 2023. Mr Sobyanin, I am sure that all this will be implemented, that all these plans will be carried out and all the goals set by the city administration will be achieved. I wish you all success! I would like to congratulate you once again on this exciting event. Sergei Sobyanin: Thank you very much. We will be working with your support and assistance. Vladimir Putin: I wish you all the best! <…>"

I would also like to welcome all members of the Russian Federation delegation. I know that this is only your second visit abroad for almost two years. This shows your personal commitment to our relations. You are visiting India despite all the pandemic difficulties and this shows your love of India. Despite the pandemic-related complications, the development of bilateral India-Russia relations has not slowed. We continue strengthening our specially privileged strategic partnership. We have maintained close cooperation in countering COVID-19, be it during testing vaccine production, providing humanitarian aid or helping people return home in a difficult time. Your Excellency, 2021 is an important year for bilateral relations for various reasons: this year we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 1971 Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation between India and the Soviet Union and two decades of strategic partnership. This is why I am so pleased to meet you in this special year because you have stood behind our strategic partnership over the past 20 years. Many fundamental changes have taken place in the world in the past few decades. Various geopolitical formations have come into being, but one thing remained immune to change – the Russia-India friendship. Our countries not only cooperate with each other but also show special care for each other's sensitive issues. This is indeed a unique, trust-based model of interstate friendship. Your Excellency, 2021 is important for our strategic partnership as well. The first meeting of foreign ministers and defence ministers in the ""2+2"" format took place today and thus launched one more mechanism to strengthen practical cooperation. We have maintained regular contact on Afghanistan and on a number of other issues as well. The interregional side of our partnership, which goes back to the Eastern Economic Forum and our summit in Vladivostok, has become a specific part of cooperation between the Russian Far East and various Indian states. In the economy, we have adopted a long-term vision to reinforce our relationship. Our goal is to increase mutual trade to US$30 billion by 2025 and to increase mutual investment to US$50 billion. To do so, we must issue the proper assignments to our respective business communities. The various agreements that were concluded today will help us expand cooperation as well. Our defence cooperation is being strengthened through joint development and production efforts under the Made in India programme. Cooperation in space and civilian nuclear energy is expanding as well. I would like to congratulate Russia on obtaining observer status in the Non-Aligned Movement and dialogue partner status in the Indian Ocean Rim Association. We were delighted to support Russia's presence in these associations. India and Russia have similar positions on many regional and global issues. We will have the opportunity to exchange views on these matters during today's meeting. Your Excellency, Once again, welcome to India. I would also like to welcome all members of the Russian delegation. Despite your busy schedule, you made the time to visit us, and we appreciate this. I am sure that our discussions today will be very productive for our relations. Welcome again. President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Prime Minister, my friend. It is an honour and a privilege for me to visit friendly India once again. We regularly hold summits at the highest level, in fact, they take place every year, with India and Russia taking turns in hosting them. Unfortunately, we had to skip last year due to the pandemic. Still, it is our turn to come to India, and I thank you for your invitation. Russia views India as a major power, whose people have been very friendly to us. Our relations proceed from a very positive foundation. They are developing and forward-looking. In 2020, trade between our countries decreased by more than 17 percent, but in the first nine months of 2021 it grew by over 38 percent. There is no doubt that we have every opportunity to reach the trade volumes you have mentioned. This also applies to investment, which currently stands at US$38 billion and is more or less equally distributed between the two countries, with Russia having a slightly larger share. That said, we have been working together in very important and promising areas, including energy, high technology, and space. I am certain that the programmes you have mentioned will be carried out, including the one to train an Indian cosmonaut. We have been promoting military-technical cooperation like with no other partner of ours. Together, we develop and manufacture high-technology military products, including in India. There is another essential item on our agenda, which is of interest for both India and Russia. I am referring to taking care of the environment. Our minds are set on this topic, the green agenda, as well as on the economy and ways of developing it. Of course, we are realistic in our efforts, seeking to fulfil the needs of our economies and improve the standard of living for our citizens on an ongoing basis. We remain proactively involved on the international stage. Just as you have said, our positions coincide on many issues. Of course, terrorism and efforts to fight it are a matter of grave concern, as are combatting drug trafficking and organised crime. In this context, the developments in Afghanistan are of course a matter of serious concern for us. The foreign and defence ministers, who are present today, held their first meeting in such format, demonstrating our commitment to developing our relations in international and military affairs. We hold joint exercises both in India and Russia. We are grateful for the attention you have given to this aspect of our cooperation and intend to keep moving in the same direction. Once again, thank you very much for your invitation. <…>"

I am delighted to welcome you. Thank you for being with us on this day and for your visit to Russia. As you know, the UN General Assembly established International Volunteer Day in 1985, while Russia began celebrating it five years ago. I would like to note that over that period, the Russian volunteer movement has become strong and respectable, and really has a serious impact on humanitarian aspects of life in Russia. You know about the#WeAreTogether campaign, which has been active in Russia for more than two years– sadly– during the pandemic. It has now evolved into a nationwide movement. Hundreds of thousands of people are involved and they have already helped 6.5 million people. We do our best to support such undertakings and activities. I know that you, too, took part in this work. Thank you very much for that. For my part, I have also met with volunteers today– just before joining you I met with the winners of state decorations. I awarded the person who won the[2021 Volunteer of the Year] contest, a paediatrician at one of the medical centres. I just heard young people– they are all young people– tell me how they do their work, what tracks they are moving on, and what they see as their priorities. All this certainly makes the most favourable impression. Mr Rocca, we have been working fruitfully for a long time with your organisation, with the Red Cross and Red Crescent. This federation makes a significant and sizeable contribution to the development of that very humanitarian aspect of which I just spoke. We know how much attention you personally give to these matters. Next year, in 2022, we will celebrate the 155th anniversary of the Russian Red Cross Society, and we will certainly make every effort to ensure that this date is celebrated deservingly. I am confident that the Russian Red Cross will also fulfil its mandate in good faith, selflessly serving people and developing cooperation with its colleagues and partners from other countries. I know that the International Federation of Red Cross and Crescent Societies, which you lead, spans 192 countries– a very large and respectable organisation. Such broad interaction between different states contributes to the effective promotion of programmes in healthcare, social services and disaster relief. The humanitarian mission of the Red Cross is extremely significant for all of humanity, especially now in the context of the pandemic. We understand this perfectly and are fully aware of this. The fundamental principles of the Red Cross movement– humanism and impartiality– are indeed the driving force for achieving results in all other aspects of interaction in the international arena and creating a special atmosphere for people to better understand each other and to join forces to stand up to the challenges humanity is facing. There is no need to list them now; there are many of them. Your activity will certainly help to ensure that they are solved in the best possible way. We are happy to see you and we hope that our interaction with your organisation will continue in the nearest future, as well as in the medium and long term. We are delighted to see you in Russia. Welcome. President of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Francesco Rocca(retranslated): Thank you, Mr President. Thank you very much. Thank you for finding the time to meet with me. For me, it is a great honour to be able to discuss humanitarian priorities and challenges with you. This is also a wonderful opportunity to meet with Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova. I have already met with Healthcare Minister Mikhail Murashko, and tomorrow, I will meet with Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Vershinin and Acting Minister for Civil Defence, Emergencies and Natural Disaster Relief Alexander Chupriyan. For me, it was a great honour to attend the International Forum of Civic Engagement We Are Together, which you mentioned. I met with volunteers, and we discussed key priorities. I heard their stories, and this is important; such events are very important for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and for the Russian Red Cross Society. I am aware of the humanitarian needs and challenges facing the humanitarian sectors both in Russia and all over the world. I know that the Russian Federation is involved in humanitarian peacekeeping efforts in all regions of the world. Russia supports people who are vulnerable, and this is wonderful and very important work. We are grateful to Russian authorities and the people of Russia for your contribution to combating the COVID-19 pandemic. As the biggest global humanitarian organisation, we are concerned that the humanitarian situation is becoming more and more complicated in many countries around the world. Millions of people suffer from national and global humanitarian challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the forcible relocation of people, the climate crisis, natural calamities and industrial accidents. Unfortunately, they are happening increasingly often. Mr President, you are well aware of this. Our biggest strength is our volunteer network, volunteers at national levels, at the levels of Red Cross societies all over the world. These societies have wonderful experience of work in these spheres. We are delighted that the Russian Red Cross Society also works actively as a humanitarian organisation. It is our strong member, and we strive to reinforce and strengthen its potential, so that it would make an even greater contribution to our common work. Mr President, you may know that many positive changes took place at the Russian Red Cross this year. In particular, its leadership has changed, giving way to a new young team. They are very energetic and determined people. Our society has attained considerable results in strengthening the capability of the Russian Red Cross to provide humanitarian aid to vulnerable groups of people. We would like the Russian Red Cross to be a strong partner and a strong member of our organisation, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, to remain Russia's main humanitarian organisation and to continue to help settle humanitarian problems, including in Russia. We believe that the Russian Federation is a highly committed country when it comes to humanitarian response measures. The Russian Red Cross is a strategic partner for our federation. I am convinced that the Russian Federation and the Russian Red Cross can and will play a major role at the global level. Mr President, we are trying to strengthen our interaction both at the national and at the global level. We believe that you can play a more important role in the humanitarian field. We are ready to expand our joint efforts. Mr President, I would like to address the issues I planned to discuss with you today, if I may. The first such issue is the COVID-19 pandemic, which is still with us. I would like to mention our efforts to deal with its humanitarian consequences. Nearly two years after identifying the first COVID-19 case, the end of the pandemic is a long way off. One of the ways to defeat the virus and stop its proliferation is equal and fair access to vaccines. Collective and joint efforts must be redoubled without delay to bring this about. At this point, there are over 7 billion vaccine doses available, but more energetic actions must be taken to create the herd immunity and ensure access to vaccination for all vulnerable groups of people. The impacts of the pandemic are horrible, from the loss of jobs to mental health problems and decreasing access to the basic health services. The pandemic has hit hard at the vulnerable groups, including migrants. They need broader support, because their social and legal standing is being undermined by the coronavirus pandemic. The authorities should take measures to give all migrants, regardless of their legal status and situation, access to health services. Efforts must also be taken to provide them with reliable information about ways to protect themselves from the virus. We look forward to cooperating with the Russian Federation on ensuring equitable distribution of Russia's Sputnik vaccine across other countries and continents. We are working with the Russian Foreign Ministry on Sputnik's free humanitarian deliveries. We have met with the Russian Red Cross and ministries to discuss this procedure in its technical aspects, and hope that there will be a positive decision on this matter, including thanks to your involvement. In this sense, the involvement by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is essential for ensuring vaccine equity for the most vulnerable people in many countries in need. There is also a need to help our members. This would ensure assistance to the most vulnerable groups who cannot get this assistance through other mechanisms. Mr President, there is one more critical question, including for you– the issue of migrant flows. Every day, people are trying to reach the European Union, attempting to cross Polish, Lithuanian or Belarusian borders in search of a better and safer life. The situation deteriorated in early November with several thousand migrants approaching the Polish and Lithuanian borders from the Belarusian side. According to the Belarusian authorities, there are some 5,000 migrants in Belarus. Many of them have been sheltered at a logistics centre. The Belarusian Red Cross is helping them within this logistics centre. Our teams are offering these people psychological support. However, the crisis we are witnessing there, and its humanitarian consequences, are a matter of concern for us. We are worried about the safety of these migrants, their increased vulnerability with the winter approaching, and the possible separation of families. We are helping the Belarusian Red Cross to carry out its humanitarian mandate. I travelled to Belarus just last week, where we issued a call on governments, businesses and civil society to support the national Red Cross societies in Belarus, Lithuania and Poland which are currently responding to this crisis. The Belarusian Red Cross is the only organisation with direct access to the vulnerable people on that country's territory. We believe that the Red Cross also plays an important role when it comes to bringing assistance to these people. This is a very important aspect of these efforts. The need to strengthen the Russian Red Cross activities at national and international levels is another important aspect. As I have already said, the Russian Red Cross enjoys tremendous trust. The work of local societies has become even more important during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has critical significance for saving people's lives and for assisting the most vulnerable people. National societies are key elements of a system for assisting all people in need. As I have already noted, the Red Cross has a tremendous potential for expanding its capabilities and for delivering humanitarian relief aid. Russia is one of the largest countries in the world, and its national Red Cross Society should reflect the country's global role, so as to play a greater and more important role. Your presence here at our meeting today highlights your country's commitment to this work. The approval of the Law on the Russian Red Cross is an important element. This is important for the national society. The law will make it possible to chart the Red Cross' specific roles and mandate, to provide it with a special status among other non-profit organisations, and it will clarify the Russian Red Cross' relations with government bodies in the field of humanitarian activities. The approval of the law on protecting its emblem will also make the Red Cross more recognisable in the country, and this will help recognise the special status of the Russian Red Cross as a humanitarian organisation. Mr President, the final item on our current agenda has to do with support for the Russian language as the Federation's official language. Russia has kindly supported the Federation in translating key documents at statutory meetings of the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement. We value the support within the framework of this initiative because many national societies can benefit from this service. In all, 300 million people speak Russian all over the world. We support the initiative of the Russian Red Cross on including the Russian language in the list of the Federation's working languages. This will make it possible to expand the Russian-speaking region's access to the movement's materials. Therefore, we consider it important to support the Russian Red Cross' plans to create a linguistic centre for translating the movement's materials and for further distributing them among the Russian-speaking national societies. Your Excellency, in conclusion, allow me to once again thank you for this wonderful opportunity to meet with you. Thank you for finding the time to discuss humanitarian challenges facing all of us and ways of resolving these problems and strengthening the Russian Red Cross at the international level. Mr President, thank you for noting the important role of the International Federation. I am inspired by the energy of young people, the volunteers I have met over these days. It was a great pleasure for me to see so many young people who are dedicated to their work and their activities. Mr Putin, thank you very much. Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I would like to touch upon the discussion points you have mentioned. The first of them concerns, of course, the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. It is true, and I fully agree with you on this, that the main task here is vaccination. We are trying to avoid enforcement measures and are trying instead to use persuasion, to combat prejudice and suspicion related to the rejection of vaccination as such. It should be said that overall, we can see, especially recently, that these efforts are yielding the necessary result. As I said, it is very important to use persuasion, so that people will feel an inner need to get vaccinated. I will not go into detail now, but I fully agree with you that we certainly need to rally our efforts at the international level to defeat the disease. If problems related to the insufficient level of vaccination persist in at least one of the world's regions, new variants, new strains of the virus will keep returning even to the countries with a high level of vaccination coverage. We have no problem with this. Our only problem in this regard is that we need to receive, as soon as possible, a certificate of the World Health Organisation allowing our vaccine which you have mentioned, Sputnik V, to be used more broadly throughout the world. As of now, around 200 million people have been vaccinated with our vaccine. But we must ensure that those who receive the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V, are allowed on a par with those who have been vaccinated with other vaccines to move freely around the world and to feel as the full citizens of the world in the global sense, without any infringements on their rights, including the right to cross national borders. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has 192 member states, and so we pin our hopes on your support for the proliferation of our vaccine. It should be said that the millions of people who have received the vaccine, and the analysis of information we have accumulated about their health after vaccination show that the Russian vaccine is definitely one of the most effective against COVID-19 and also one of the safest vaccines, since it has no negative side-effects. I myself has been vaccinated and revaccinated with Sputnik V. We have also created an intranasal vaccine. I would like to say once again about the analysis of available information, including the data provided by absolutely unbiased sources, which I would like to point out, because we are exporting the vaccine where it is being analysed, and independent organisations working in foreign countries provide information about the results of vaccination to us. It can be said without exaggeration that the results are very good. I will not say anything about other vaccines now; I do not want this to sound as if we mistrust our colleagues. We trust them explicitly. But I just want to reaffirm that Russia's Sputnik V vaccine is both effective and safe. We are helping many countries, not only by supplying the vaccine commercially but also by sending it free of charge, and we intend to make broader use of this form of support. We are also supplying test kits, including free of charge, as well as medicines, which we have created, and which are being applied increasingly broadly. Therefore, we will certainly continue acting in this spirit. There is no doubt about this. Regarding migration flows, fortunately, we are not seeing such flows in the direction of Europe via Russia. To be honest, I hope that this will not happen in the future. Regarding the situation on the Belarusian-Polish border, this situation exists, but it is very important to follow the principles and rules that the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has always observed. It is necessary to de-politicise the situation; it must not be politicised under any circumstances. There are about 5,000 migrants in Belarus at the moment. This year, Italy handled 54,000 migrants. There is also a crisis on the border between France and the United Kingdom, and the mutual grievances between these countries. Belarusian authorities are doing everything they can. For example, they are persuading people to return to their homes, primarily to Iraq. But we should probably take a closer look at what is happening on the border and at the actions of the neighbouring state, namely, the Republic of Poland. People should not be sprayed with water that contains herbicides and pesticides which can cause burns and otherwise harm these migrants' health, including women and small children. This does not fit with the principles of humane treatment of migrants in any way. How many people have already perished on the border, and how many of them have been buried? They are being buried there almost every day. This is a great tragedy. We must also pay attention to this. I always point this out in my contacts and conversations with my colleagues from European countries. I hope that the situation on the Polish-Belarusian border will be gradually defused and eventually normalised, although people remain there whose destiny is still unclear. I certainly agree with you that it is necessary to support the Organisation of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent, so as to provide essential assistance to the people who need such help on the spot. In turn, we will do everything possible, if it becomes necessary. To the best of my knowledge, Belarusian authorities and the Belarusian Red Cross are working actively to prevent people's suffering there. To be honest, I am particularly worried about young children. It is simply impossible to remain indifferent when we see how they are forced to spend the nights outdoors, now that winter has set in. I simply cannot imagine how they are surviving there. This is an enormous ordeal for them. Of course, the Red Cross' assistance is highly necessary. As for the Russian Red Cross Society and the law on the Red Cross, I agree with you that this regulatory document remains relevant, and we are now discussing it, including the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian Parliament. We will cautiously and calmly move towards this goal working carefully and steadily. I agree with you that it is necessary to provide the Russian Red Cross Society with a good basic institutional and legal foundation for its activities. Finally, with regard to our support for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies using Russian as its working language, I must say that we will do all we can to enable the Russian language to acquire this quality, especially since it is an official language at the United Nations. This will only do good, keeping in mind the fact that you, Mr President, have also mentioned, namely that Russian is spoken by approximately 300 million people in the world. Many countries will certainly use this language, I am sure, because this is convenient for them. We will support this initiative in every way. In conclusion, I would like to say the humanitarian mission of the Red Cross is generally of high importance for the entire humankind, and particularly so now, during the pandemic. The fundamental principles of the Red Cross movement– humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, universality and unity– I am absolutely certain, are absolutely essential in our day and age. These are the values that, without any doubt, transcend all borders. We must make every effort– and will do so– to induce the entire international community to put these principles into practice. Mr President, I would like to thank you once again for being with us today. I would like to wish you all the best and success in your noble work. Thank you very much. Francesco Rocca: Thank you very much, Mr President. Thank you again for your time, for your attention, and for what you have said. To conclude, I would like to say that I fully agree with you regarding the status of migrants in Europe. You were quite right in saying this. I told the journalists the same. I mean that we see differences in Italy and other regions of Europe. Some people wish to exploit these differences. We should work together to de-escalate this situation. I would like to thank you for commenting on this highly delicate topic. We will continue to support the Russian Red Cross with 100- and even 110-percent certainty, I should say. Mr President, thank you for your time and your attention. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. All the best."

Pavel Berezhansky, head of the pulmonary department at the Morozov Children's City Hospital, won the 2021 Volunteer of the Year title for his project offering counselling and support to parents. The President also took part in The New Year Tree of Wishes event.*** President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, my friends. I am delighted to welcome you all and congratulate you on Volunteer Day. Russia is marking Volunteer Day for the fifth time and this certainly is testament to the fact that your activity, your work for the benefit of society and specific people is highly appreciated in our country. We really need sincere and caring people who follow the call of their hearts and come to the aid of others, help address significant problems, achieve tangible results for the common good and, what's more, offer much-needed, even indispensable support for specific people, a specific person, or specific families. We know that volunteers have taken on a tremendous load and much responsibility during the pandemic; we know how much effort and warmth they have been investing into overcoming our common hardships. They have been risking their health and even their own lives. I would like to once again thank everyone who showed this level of solidarity, those who did not step aside in this difficult period, who were not indifferent, who implemented their own initiatives or participated in the nationwide mutual support campaign#WeAreTogether. Non-profits, entrepreneurs, and public organisations are now in its ranks, as are political parties and our leading political force, United Russia. I thank everyone who has helped and is helping doctors work in hospitals and red zones, who help the elderly and anyone else who needs their support. Your work is inherently noble, much needed, and always in demand. Your example inspires and encourages hundreds of thousands, even millions of our citizens to take similar action. The volunteer movement is becoming a more powerful force every year. I think it was right to give this name,#WeAreTogether, to your forum, which is traditionally timed to coincide with Volunteer Day, as well as to the best volunteer projects contest, which received over 25,000 applications this year. These words are imbued with relatable and pragmatic meaning, with an understanding of how important your unity is. That pooling efforts for the sake of our people and our country can always make things better and lead to impressive results in any sphere. Volunteer work rests on such ideas as creativeness, humanity and mutual assistance– words that are relatable and understandable to everyone. These are universal values capable of erasing artificial barriers, boundaries, and sometimes even disagreements. Thanks to them, this forum has now acquired an international format and significance– it has brought together volunteers from all regions of our huge country, the Russian Federation, as well as representatives from more than 40 countries. The#WeAreTogether award has also become international this year as well, and it was you who initiated the change. It is now awarded to foreign volunteers and their projects, too. I am delighted to welcome our guests from India, Slovenia, Mexico and other countries. This kind of partnership and cooperation definitely serves to achieve common goals, helps to find the best and most effective ways to resolve people's problems and concerns, both at local and global levels. Once again– mercy, compassion, and an impulse to come to the aid of those for whom times are tough are values ​​that know no boundaries; I would like to emphasise this once again. They unite people, even those who live far from each other– in different countries and on different continents. Volunteers are keenly sensitive to something called the pulse of events; they go to places where things might be dangerous and are sure to be difficult, where the situation is extreme in the literal sense of the word. For example, this year in the south of Russia people faced the dire consequences of floods, or in Siberia where people were fighting forest fires. This personal and profound understanding of problems and sore spots increasingly elevate volunteer initiatives to a new level– a level where system-wide, state decisions are made. And of course, I will certainly support all your undertakings, including work in government bodies to support the volunteer movement. This also applies to volunteers having insurance. I know that even here, at this forum, you continue to help those who need support, that in fact this is a forum for real deeds, for good and kind projects, including for the upcoming New Year holidays. Those projects are especially important for children at orphanages, as well as children in hospitals who cannot celebrate the New Year with their families and loved ones. They need heartfelt warmth and sincere support, they need a personal touch. And I don't know anyone capable of providing this kind of support except you. For my part, as is traditional, I will certainly join you to take part in The New Year Tree of Wishes, a wonderful charity event. <…>"

Nazi Germany's plans to seize Moscow were shattered for good. For many centuries, Tula has played an important role in strengthening the Russian statehood and building our motherland's military glory. The special heroic chapters in the city's history date back to the Great Patriotic War. For many long days and nights, the city's defenders, the Red Army soldiers and commanders, the Tula Workers' Regiment and fighter plane battalions demonstrated exceptional courage and bravery selflessly fighting for every inch of their native land. The city of gunmakers remained unconquered. The Battle of Tula paralysed the enemy's powerful forces and predetermined our victory in the Battle of Moscow. We will always revere this heroism, cherish the memory of those who fought for our Motherland, and strengthen the traditions of patriotism and unity. On this festive day, I would like to offer my warmest words of gratitude and respect to our dear veterans."" The Tula defensive continued from October 24 to December 5, 1941, and was part of the Battle of Moscow. In fierce battles, the Soviet army averted the Nazi troops' advance towards Tula and prevented their attempts to approach Moscow from the south. On December 6, the Red Army launched a counter-offensive throwing back the invader's divisions 130 km away from Tula."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67271,Vladimir Putin addressed participants in third phase of United Russia party 20th congress,2021-12-04T13:25:00Z,NA,,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends, Greetings to all participants in the final, third stage of the United Russia congress. You are to discuss the party's plans and to carry out rotation in its governing and central bodies. And of course, it is important to analyse the results of the autumn elections here, at the congress. I believe that United Russia has performed well in the rather difficult, even extraordinary conditions of the election campaign, has withstood tough and open competition, won confidently, with a good advantage, and once again proved that it is a true leader, a party of popular representation with a parliamentary majority. Once again, congratulations on your resounding victory. This result is extremely significant for our entire country, for its stable and effective development. Your success was not determined by loud and attractive slogans, which mainly involve nothing but empty and impossible promises. You had a different campaign style, a different approach, a different attitude towards voters. The party offered the citizens of Russia a constructive, fruitful and unifying agenda and presented a programme that it began to form long before the elections, during the course of meetings and conversations with people and through discussing topical, acute, pressing issues with them. The programme is rightfully called popular, because it is based on the proposals and initiatives of the citizens of our huge country, of all its regions. And what is important, each of its points is well-weighed and calculated from the point of view of implementation within defined, specific deadlines. I believe that voters positively assessed the updated composition of United Russia. Volunteers, civic activists, and youth leaders became its candidates for election at various levels. Almost half of the composition of your faction in the State Duma of the eighth convocation has changed. United Russia was one of the first major socio-political forces that supported the We Are Together volunteer movement and took an active part in it. Many members and supporters of the party became volunteers in the very first days of the pandemic: they helped doctors and nurses in hospitals and outpatient clinics, delivered food and medicines and did everything in their power to make people feel their care and attention in those difficult times. It is crucially important that you continue this work. Of course, there is no other way because our policy and our common goals and plans are focused on the people, their needs, wellbeing and quality of life. This is an unconditional priority both for United Russia as the leading political force and for those present here today, as well as for hundreds of thousands of our colleagues and associates in all regions of the country. I want to emphasise that the ultimate point of being a member of United Russia and working for it is to serve the people and respect the people. It is protecting, defending and implementing the interests of our citizens. I am glad that the party's multifaceted activity is aimed at dealing with such issues all the time, not only during election campaigns. I consider it a good thing that you are going to report to people annually, tell them about the party's concrete activities and what it has achieved. We need to speak openly about sensitive issues and about those that have not been dealt with, and to suggest solutions. I want to note that after the elections, the United Russia party immediately began implementing its goals. This shows responsibility, and the maturity of the political force. Because every word that we give people must become a real deed and the achieved result must change life for the better. The people's programme is already being implemented. Its priorities are reflected in the federal budget for the next three years. Our parliamentary faction not only supported this draft law but also made some important amendments of a social nature and helped ensure that some important decisions were made, such as increasing the minimum monthly wage and subsistence rate. I would like to thank you for your support and for quickly implementing these measures that aim to raise people's incomes, and I would also like to thank you for promoting other initiatives that we agreed on during the election campaign, including in June and August, at the Congress' previous stages. I would like to recall that, at the time, this concerned additional payments to senior citizens, the indexation of pensions and pay grades of service personnel and law enforcement officers, and new ambitious programmes to provide employment for young people, to relocate tenants of dilapidated housing, to develop a medical rehabilitation system, and to build and overhaul schools. In the future, I am asking you to toughen public control over all these matters and other aspects seen as significant by the people. For this purpose, you should use the potential of party commissions, now headed by the leaders of the United Russia ticket. They successfully guided the party to victory, and I know that they are now ready to make their contribution to implementing various commitments. Regarding the organisation of work in general, I suggest sticking to the following principle: you should set new and more ambitious tasks after accomplishing any particular task. Consequently, the United Russia people's programme will be implemented in terms of various projects, and it will also develop as a living document, it will be renewed dynamically and in a high-quality manner, so as to meet the demands of the times and people's current needs and expectations. They reach out to you, those who represent them in the corridors of power, on the most pressing matters of concern to them. They hope that the most influential political forces will respond and promptly assist them. I would like to note that we have all the resources for supporting people in addressing the matters they raise. And the party's local divisions, the so-called grass-roots organisations, should play a key role here. First of all, it is necessary to consolidate detailed and result-oriented public dialogue at this level and, on the whole, to value and expand feedback that helps the party itself to grow and become stronger in terms of ideology and human resources, to rely on those who have won a reputation for themselves in significant public activities, science, business operations and creative spheres. By relying on those who are talented, successful and caring, by taking their opinions into account and engaging them in joint projects, and by helping them to make a political career, the party ensures broad public representation, which is a strategically important mission. I am confident that United Russia can accomplish it through reliance on its prestige and considerable political experience. The party was established 20 years ago. I remember its constituent congress very well. It took place on December 1, 2001. I would like to say that the ability to take responsibility for the country and to work for the people has been its strong side from day one. The party more than once proved with its deeds that it satisfies these requirements. The essence of its activities was to make a decisive contribution to overcoming the systemic and sometimes deadly risks, which threatened not only people's safety but the very existence of our homeland at the turn of the 2000s. During the past 20 years, the party firmly and consistently held patriotic positions, which was clearly manifested during the adoption of fundamental, history-making and pivotal decisions on strengthening Russia's sovereignty, protecting its national interests, improving its political system, boosting the economy, developing modern approaches to social problems, and supporting families with children. I would like to emphasise the consolidating role of United Russia as a parliamentary party. Your efforts at the federal and regional levels are helping to rally patriotically-minded and responsible forces towards achieving our common goals and priorities. This is extremely important for adopting high-quality laws in the interests of our society and citizens. I always count on you, on the United Russia party as a powerful and reliable political force, and on your professionalism and energy in addressing the large-scale tasks we have planned for the coming years and for the longer term. I would like to thank you for your invariable support, to congratulate you on the 20th anniversary of the party, and to wish you success in your striving to move ahead at full throttle. We stand together for Russia."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67269,Telephone conversation with President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan,2021-12-03T18:55:00Z,NA,Vladimir Putin had a telephone conversation with President of the Republic of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the latter's initiative.,"A number of current bilateral issues, including practical aspects of energy and agricultural cooperation, were reviewed during the conversation. It was agreed to instruct relevant departments to start active preparations for a regular session of the High-Level Cooperation Council, which could be held in the beginning of the new year. At the request of the President of Turkey, Vladimir Putin informed him about the main results of the trilateral meeting of the leaders of Russia, Azerbaijan and Armenia in Sochi on November 26, which was timed to the anniversary of the signing of the November 9, 2020, statement on Nagorno-Karabakh. Importantly, during the talks, Baku and Yerevan confirmed their willingness to cooperate for the sake of stability in the region and to create mechanisms for the delimitation and demarcation of the border between the two states. In addition, optimism was expressed about restoring trade, economic and transport links. Having noted the importance of Russia's mediation, Recep Tayyip Erdogan expressed support for continuing to coordinate efforts, in part through the Russia-Turkey ceasefire monitoring centre. Mutual satisfaction was expressed with the level of cooperation to promote stability and advance the peace process in Syria. The military of both countries will continue cooperating in the Idlib de-escalation zone in the north of the country. Regarding Libya, the emphasis was on the absence of any alternatives to a UN-mediated political and diplomatic settlement. Hope was expressed for the success of the national elections on December 24, 2021, which should help restore Libya's statehood and territorial integrity. The importance of complete and strict observance of the 2015 Minsk Package of Measures and other agreements, including the Normandy format accords, was emphasised during the discussion of the domestic crisis in Ukraine. The President of Russia stressed that Kiev has continued its destructive efforts to sabotage the Minsk agreements, such as provocative activities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the conflict zone, including the use of Bayraktar attack drones. It was stressed that Kiev must abandon all attempts to pressure Donbass through force. The leaders agreed on further personal contacts."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67266,Meeting with Central Election Commission Chairperson Ella Pamfilova,2021-12-03T15:05:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin met with Central Election Commission Chairperson Ella Pamfilova.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ms Pamfilova, when we reviewed the operation of election commissions this autumn, we agreed to meet in person to discuss the current ongoing work and what should be done additionally by the Government and the Presidential Executive Office to support you and your colleagues. Let us talk about this now. Central Election Commission Chairperson Ella Pamfilova Pamfilova EllaChairperson of Central Election Comission: Thank you very much. On that occasion, I gave you a booklet with the statistical updates regarding the previous election campaign. Today I do not want to mention all these figures again but I would like to highlight several specific features. I have compiled a small booklet about what we are proud of, which is our digital services that number about a dozen and that enjoy the demand of all voters and everyone else involved in the process, including the commissions. Take a look; we are proud of this. These digital services enjoy great demand, but first of all, I would like to say that competition at the last election was very high and very real. No fewer parties took part in the process than in 2016, 14 of them, and as many as 16 parties won mandates at regional elections, and the number of rejected candidates was three times lower: only 372 compared to 1,189 in 2016. This completely overturned all speculation about the wholesale rejection of candidates. The level of rejection was very low. Since there is much speculation about foreign agents, I would like to say that none of them were denied their rights. For example, we had a candidate running for a federal mandate and six people running for regional mandates who performed the functions of or were affiliated with a foreign agent. Likewise, the observers and media outlets who were performing the functions of foreign agents, monitored and provided coverage of the elections on a par with others in accordance with the current legislation. Vladimir Putin: I am aware of your position in this matter, which is to closely monitor and analyse the practice of the implementation of this law, and to make whatever adjustments are needed. I know this. Ella Pamfilova: Yes, that is correct. We need to streamline it so that it is more effective, selective, expedient and target-oriented. Vladimir Putin: It must also serve the purpose for which it has been adopted. Ella Pamfilova: Yes, and it must not hit undeservingly at those who do not deserve this. Vladimir Putin: It must not violate citizens' rights. Ella Pamfilova: Exactly. Let me draw your attention to widespread speculation on another matter. We even issued a report on it in advance. I am referring to the allegation that we have too many people who were stripped of their passive right to vote. This is not true. On the contrary, in Russia this indicator is much lower compared to many other countries, even the most developed ones that pride themselves on their democracies. Fewer than one and a half percent in Russia do not enjoy passive voting rights, compared to six percent in the United States, to give you an example. There is one more issue I wanted to mention. What makes this election special, and we have a chart on this topic as well, as you can see, is that independent candidates came in second in the number of seats after United Russia, which won the majority of mandates. You can see that independent candidates were far ahead of all other parties with 12 or almost 13 percent. This is another unique aspect of this campaign. These candidates worked hard and collected signatures, including using our services. As for electronic signatures, we now use artificial intelligence to verify even those collected by traditional means. This year training quality was very high, so almost all parties filed quality documents, which goes to say that we were quite effective in working with them. This also led to fewer refusals. All the digital services have been effective. Another important aspect of this campaign, which I wanted to highlight, was that almost half of all candidates at all levels were newcomers. This cannot be underestimated; after all, they provide a fresh perspective. This strikes a balance between experience and new people who can bring something new. An important note: not only was the three-day voting in the ongoing pandemic justified, but voters came to appreciate it even more. Judging by all opinion surveys, people who came to vote appreciated the safety and convenience of this solution and supported this arrangement. Vladimir Putin: However, the election commissions had more work to do. Ella Pamfilova: This is true, but this is a separate matter. I will submit specific proposals on what can be done in this regard. It may be harder for us, but we made voting easier, so voters benefited from this. I also wanted to draw your attention to at-home voting. In the current environment, due to the pandemic, the number of people who wanted to vote at home surged. Had we held the election in a single day, our commissions would have been simply unable to visit all these people. This three-day arrangement enabled us to cover all the needs. All in all, 14.14 percent of voters voted from home, which does not take into account voting in remote locations, which is a separate category. For the sake of comparison, during the preceding elections, in 2016, 2011 and 2007, this figure averaged 6.5 percent. This way the daily workload was lower, and commissions could stretch their resources in a way that enabled many more people to cast their ballots. People appreciated this, too. By the way, this was not an easy task, since we were very strict when it came to validating these votes. There is a very clear and straightforward correlation between the number of at-home voters and the number of voters who were over 60 years old. This is also important. By the way, almost half a million observers representing parties, candidates and civic chambers monitored the voting process this year, both during at-home voting and at polling stations. Vladimir Putin: Is that more than during the previous election? Ella Pamfilova: It is. In 2016, there were four observers per polling station, on average, while this year there were five, with an average of over five people per station. This is a substantial increase. There were quite a few international observers. They came from 50 countries and international organisations, including PACE[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe], which is currently drafting its report. This is also important. I do hope that it presents a balanced position, because we did not hide anything from them. Another important feature is video surveillance, which you suggested back in the day. Vladimir Putin: Back in 2012. Ella Pamfilova: Yes. But circumstances have changed drastically and now we are living in an age of cyber wars and cyberattacks. We had to think about security, on the one hand, and protection, on the other. These days people are more cautiously protecting their personal data, their privacy and so on. That is why we proposed professional surveillance for this year's elections. I will explain the difference. We did not make the streaming publicly available on the internet. Just imagine that half of the population goes to vote and the footage is available for downloading. Some people may be against that. Moreover, there is no video surveillance during elections in Western countries because people see it as a violation of their privacy. We came up with the best option: the footage was streamed on a private website accessed by all election participants, both parties and unaffiliated candidates. There were also special public monitoring centres in every region for interested voters. We created over 120,000 user accounts and analysed the results. There was some negative feedback and claims that access had been denied to some but it is not true. We issued many more account credentials than were actually used in the end. Those who wanted had the opportunity to observe. What are the advantages of the proposed system? First, there is a rewind option for real-time verification and keeping records. The second and most important advantage is there is protection from simultaneous mass downloading that can bring down the system. There was a risk of the footage being swapped using the new technology of making fakes. We removed this risk and actually targeted those who engage in producing fakes and substituting reality. There had been some panic over this. We believe that this type of surveillance system was an effective tool that we will continue to use. We will discuss further improvements with experts. I would like to say a few words on remote e-voting. Having analysed it, we saw that, of course, this year we used it much more than in the past. We analysed all pluses and minuses. This is, of course, a very promising form, Mr President. It will not replace traditional voting but should be used alongside it. Nevertheless, having studied all the pros and cons, I believe that, while we will keep working hard on it, we are still not going to rush as long as there are any questions. The main problem we must solve is to achieve a high level of trust and find a mechanism of civil oversight that every voter will understand. Nobody should have any doubt that the system is under civil control. We are moving forward, in accordance with our capabilities and technical preparedness, on all matters related to oversight and security. I would also like to thank you for your support. You asked about the assistance we need. Owing to you, your support, we will almost double the number of touch-screen voting machines that is, our electronic ballot boxes. Last year we used all the resources we had– over 13,000 e-ballot boxes. Now we are ordering almost 10,000 new ones. Thank you for this support. They are highly trusted and sought-after in the regions. This is a big step forward in improving on traditional voting forms. We will never abandon them but we will use electronic forms as well. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67258,Meeting on coal industry in Kuzbass,2021-12-02T16:40:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow","Vladimir Putin held a meeting, via videoconference, on the situation in the coal industry in Kuzbass.","President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, good afternoon. As we all know very well, last week– on November 25– a tragedy, a big disaster, happened in the Kemerovo Region. An accident at the Listvyazhnaya mine killed miners and rescuers. This is a tragedy and pain shared by Kuzbass and the entire country, all of Russia. I would like to once again offer my condolences and words of support to the victims' families and friends. I wish a speedy recovery to all the injured. All these days we stayed in close contact with the region's governor, Sergei Tsivilev, who heads the emergency response centre. Regular updates also come from the Emergencies Ministry leadership. As you know, senior officials of the Emergencies Ministry and Rostekhnadzor travelled to the region immediately, and, of course, federal agencies received instructions to provide help and assistance to the families of those killed and injured. We all must keep a close eye on the situation. Today I would like to ask you to report on what has already been done and what must be done by the Government and other authorities. Above all, of course, we are talking about medical assistance for the injured: how many are already out of the hospital and how many remain there, are there enough medicines and medical equipment, is any additional assistance required from federal medical centres? I know that, according to preliminary reports, nothing seems to be needed, but, nevertheless, I would like you to report on this additionally. I would like to ask the Government and local authorities to take care of everyone who had to face this disaster, families and friends of the victims, and to carefully consider every case. Personal and family situations may differ– I know this very well from the past tragic events– we cannot be guided solely by instructions on paper here. During our meeting, I expect to hear a report on how federal payments are being made to families who have lost their loved ones, as well as to the injured, what has been done and is being done in the region. Of course, we must investigate all the causes and circumstances of the accident. The relevant instructions have been given to the General Prosecutor's Office. I would like to hear how they are being implemented today. As reported, according to the preliminary data, the accident happened due to an entire range of safety violations. The region's administration has already issued instructions to inspect all the mines in the region and analyse their fire safety condition, including the availability and serviceability of sensors showing methane concentration in the air. It is well known that miners' work involves higher risk. At the same time, it is unacceptable to abuse and exploit the courage of people who descend into mines. Their lives and health must be protected, and this is the personal responsibility of everyone who is involved in organising extraction: heads of enterprises, representatives of oversight and supervisory bodies, and owners. Those who, in pursuit of profit or for some other reason, ignore, neglect the safety of people and expose them to mortal danger, must be punished according to the law, harshly, and held responsible for compliance with safety rules in mines and at all facilities of the mining industry, as well as for the proper condition of equipment and personal rescue equipment. Today we will examine the implementation of the decisions made 11 years ago after the gravest accident, the tragedy at the Raspadskaya mine. Back then, we talked about systemic work to ensure safety at coal-mining enterprises, and today we will analyse these issues. However, it is clear that additional steps are needed here, including economic ones. Of course, after these decisions were made back in 2010, I was updated on how the instructions were implemented. We must look at how they have been implemented, what has been done and how. Let us get down to this. <…> Vladimir Putin: Here is what I would like to say. After all, safety is tied to the work compensation scheme. I have returned to this issue several times today. In 2010, we agreed that the semi-fixed pay had to account for at least 70 percent of the wages. We also agreed to clearly define what is included in these 70 percent. I would like to remind you about the federal industrial agreement on the coal industry for 2019–2021. It has been mentioned today. Clause 3.2.18 states,""Employers shall ensure that the semi-fixed pay amounts to at least 70 percent of the miners' wages."" And it may seem fine but it only seems so. If we look at the breakdown, what makes up this semi-fixed pay? According to labour law, the semi-fixed pay may also include payment based on piece rates such as overtime piecework. What does it mean? It means that in reality, the miners' compensation depends on the amount of coal they produce. The semi-fixed pay also includes extra pay above the piece rates and monthly wages for working in hazardous conditions, which is very important. Hazard pay is very important. Those who wrote this knew very well what it means. As a result, these terms create economic stimuli for the miners to disregard safety requirements– and they cannot be blamed for that. They take risks because they need to provide for their families. And our job is to create conditions in which they would not have to take risks. That was the point of our decisions back in 2010. Therefore, obviously, it is necessary to clarify what is included in the semi-fixed component of the miners' wages and exclude any pay that depends on productivity. This is what must be done. It is no time to consider the owners' profits, or exports, or any other kind of profit. We must think about safety and people's lives. They must be at the centre of our decisions. Of course, liability for safety violations must be toughened. This is absolutely obvious. And it is important to expand the influence of trade unions. There is nothing to fear here. The punishment for violations currently includes administrative penalties but there is no administrative suspension as a punishment. I remember from our discussion in 2010 that the fear was that trade unions would suspend operations here and there. They will not do that. Miners need to work and earn a living. Why would the trade unions suspend operations at the slightest opportunity? They will not. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the liability for violating gas drainage requirements and specify administrative penalties. This measure is absolutely necessary. Of course, we should go back. I recall the discussions about the owners' financial responsibility. I realise what this is about, no one wants to undermine the foundations of business and to downsize the coal industry's operations. But we certainly have to think about this, and I agree with the trade union leader here. We have to resume this discussion in a calm and cautious manner, without any emotions linked with the current developments and today's tragedy; but we need to analyse all this painstakingly. The same must be done with regard to audits of the use of mineral deposits. I have just said that I want to discuss this matter once again. There is no desire to increase administrative barriers, and we are reducing them, as well as opportunities for bribery. Of course, it is necessary to fight this evil. But it is necessary to maintain safety, too. We need to monitor mining operations, design, technological and production documents and records, and their compliance with specific standards. We must do this, no matter what, and it would be better if independent agencies, not linked with owners, conducted such work. By the way, it would be possible to select audit companies together with the trade unions. The Minister spoke earlier about a programme for shutting down mines. We need to address this matter very cautiously. Indeed, the Minister said that this applied to a small number of enterprises; however, this also means jobs. But it goes without saying that we will have to deal with this matter at facilities with hazardous working conditions where this danger is too great for some other reasons, including technological or some other factors. Of course, life is life. In this connection, I would like to raise the issue of liquidation funds. We stipulate the creation of liquidation funds for high-risk enterprises, and we can think about creating such funds for mines, too. I would like to ask you to consider this and to submit appropriate proposals during preparations for the second reading of the relevant bill, which is currently being considered, and to extend them to coal mines and open-cast mines. Now, I would like to say a few words about mining oversight and dealing with the safety of hazardous production facilities and projects. I cannot help but agree that, of course, the wage levels of the relevant categories of employees of Rostekhnadzor[Federal Service for Environmental, Technological and Nuclear Supervision], do not match the level of their responsibility while fulfilling their official duties. Therefore, I am asking you to stipulate and pass the relevant decisions envisaging financial and other support for state inspectors. Such support should not be lower than the average wages of mine administration officials. I am asking the Government to submit proposals on this score, and the Presidential Executive Office should draft an instruction together with the concerned agencies. I wish you all the best. Thank you."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67255,Meeting with KAZ Minerals Board Chairman Oleg Novachuk,2021-12-02T11:00:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",The President had a meeting with Chairman of the Board of Directors of KAZ Minerals Oleg Novachuk.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr Novachuk. Tell me about your company. I know that it operates in the CIS and Russia and that you are about to start a big project in Chukotka. Chairman of the Board of Directors of KAZ Minerals Oleg Novachuk: That's correct. Vladimir Putin: Please, go ahead. Oleg Novachuk: Our company was founded in Kazakhstan. We started by developing deposits with small amounts of copper but large areas. Today KAZ Minerals is the largest copper producer in Kazakhstan. We also have projects in Kyrgyzstan, where we are the second largest gold producer. When we started exploring potential areas where our experience could be useful, we researched 92 copper projects around the world and realised that Russia's potential is simply enormous. We made comparisons, and I wanted to report to you about the Baimskoye field, located north of the Arctic Circle in the Chukotka Autonomous Area, which turned out to be the fourth largest in the world. You can see from this chart that the first largest is located in America. It is called Pebble. The third largest, Reko Diq, is located in Pakistan. Production at the first mine seems to be impossible because they have been trying to obtain a permit from environmental authorities for 35 years. Most likely, production at this mine will never begin. As for Reko Diq in northwestern Pakistan, for 12 years, it has been a subject of litigation between investors and the local government, which does not report to the central government. So, it is also unclear when production will start. If we forget about these two mines, our field will be the second largest in the world. Vladimir Putin: What about this one? Oleg Novachuk: This is Udokan, another deposit in Russia. Essentially, the two largest deposits are located in the right place. I will tell you about our strategy in a bit. Both of these deposits are the right size and located in the right place. Our Baimskoye field has tremendous reserves, including projected reserves. They amount to 23 million tonnes of copper and 2,000 tonnes of gold. This is possibly the largest copper and gold reserves in the world, since the largest field, Pebble, also contains 2,000 tonnes. We are planning to develop this deposit for 60 years, and initial production is scheduled for early 2027. We will process 70 million tonnes of ore. We are planning to build two ore-processing plants with an annual capacity of 35 million tonnes each. They are now seen as the world's largest. The plan is to produce 400,000 tonnes of copper equivalent annually. The deposit was discovered in 1972 but has not been developed so far. This can mostly be explained by low copper content in local ores, just 0.5 percent. About 25 years ago, such deposits were not valued, they were not included in balance sheets, and no one even bothered to look at them. By the way, all of the five largest deposits, except Udokan, were not listed among deposits, either. About 25 years ago, new technologies were developed and large-scale equipment emerged. I will report about this equipment separately. After that, they started looking more closely at these deposits, which became economically viable. We have another problem here in Russia, and it has to do with infrastructure. Of course, no technology can help when there is absolutely no infrastructure. The climate, especially in Chukotka, causes the third layer of problems facing such deposits. The problem is that it is possible to deliver a consignment during the four-month navigation season and unload it at a port. However, the deposit is located 600 kilometres away, that is, along a straight line. But the actual distance is even longer. Add to this the marshy terrain in summer, and it is impossible to deliver the shipment. So, in the end the deliveries are made in winter, when the terrain is frozen. But the navigation season ends and the cargo has to wait. Consequently, I have to buy everything that I need for the next winter season already today, before the contract expires. If anything goes wrong or there's a miscalculation, the project is delayed by 12 months. And such ambitious large-scale projects as ours … I just wanted to show you that we have already finished the estimates for this project, and have done the banking, technological and economic feasibility study. We are expecting the project to cost 620 billion rubles or US$8.5 billion. We have already spent 44 billion rubles. We are planning that tax proceeds worth over one trillion rubles will be added to the budgets at all levels. This would double the Chukotka budget, and the Chukotka Autonomous Area would stop receiving subsidies for the first time. During construction, we are planning to create about 11,000 jobs, and the project itself is to employ over 5,000 people during its operation. In addition to this, we are expanding freight traffic volumes via the Northern Sea Route by two million tonnes. These volumes will allow Russia to expand copper production by 25 percent, and national gold output will increase by four percent. Consequently, this Chukotka project is turning into a vital infrastructure component. Apart from creating jobs for this project, our business will attract other enterprises, including transport companies, public catering companies and service companies. In effect, the project will be surrounded by small and medium-sized businesses, and we have not yet found out how many people will be working alongside us. Quite possibly, we will be installing broadband internet for the first time in Chukotka's history. Some areas that I have visited lack not only internet access, they have no telephone lines. As our project requires internet access, the region will also become quite well-off, little by little. I will also report on technologies a bit later. Of course, we have to accomplish an ambitious task and see to it that this site will be able to use the technologies that we want to introduce there, which requires the creation of the relevant infrastructure. Of course, I would like to thank you very much for supporting the project to create small floating nuclear power plants. It involves Rosatom and the United Shipbuilding Corporation. We have now established a good partnership with them. These power plants guarantee stable electricity prices for a period of 40 years. This was the most important aspect that attracted us. The nuclear power industry was the only way to estimate the project's costs and to raise the required funding. We also had some other ideas, but, of course, it is impossible to implement them using some other fuel because prices for all other energy carriers are subject to change. We have agreed with Rosatom that they will build four barges with the capacity of about 110–115 megawatts each, which means the installed capacity for the construction of floating power plants will be 440 megawatts. One barge will stand in reserve, and three will generate electricity for us. In addition to this, it is necessary to build a port where these barges will be located. Since we are talking about this, we have thought about this, and we will be building a new port located near us. Originally, we had a plan to use the infrastructure of an existing port: the state planned to construct 860 km of roads to the Pevek port, but it is clear that it would be very difficult to carry two million tonnes by trucks for 800 km. When I arrived at the site, we mapped out a new one, which is only 400 kilometres from the field – ""only"" compared with 800 kilometres. Rosatom has offered new technologies. They already have a nuclear power plant in Pevek: the Akademik Lomonosov station. But we are talking about a new generation, that is, they put other, more powerful units there. These are units that work on icebreakers. In fact, this is the same icebreaker, so we considered it possible. We have agreed that we are building a port, and we are also building a road and 330-kilovolt (kV) power lines thanks to the support of the state: of course, the Russian Government has played a large role here, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, and Yury Trutnev[Deputy Prime Minister – Plenipotentiary Presidential Envoy to the Far Eastern Federal District] is also supervising this project. Vladimir Putin: Are you included in the Far Eastern concession? Oleg Novachuk: Yes, we are, but we have several different lines of cooperation. First, the Prime Minister instructed the Finance Ministry and the Transport Ministry to allocate 20 billion rubles for waterworks in the construction of the all-year-round port, and we are building the cargo terminal worth 15 billion rubles, so we can see we have public-private partnership here. Regarding the aerial power line, 29 billion rubles of subsidies have been allocated for the construction, but only for the lines, and we have taken on the responsibility for building substations and switching stations. And if it suddenly turns out that the calculations were incorrect and the 29 billion rubles is not enough, then we will add our own funds. This is a partnership, too. We have also agreed to build an all-year-round road and split the cost in half: we pay 35 billion and the state allocates another 35 billion as a Far Eastern concession. This means the concession will work in such a way that the state gives us a guarantee, we raise a loan, build this road, and then over a period of 12–15 years, the state pays for this loan, and we serve the interest on this loan. It is also a very flexible, very interesting, unprecedented scheme. This means we have solved all infrastructure-related issues. But apart from the fact that the infrastructure is useful for our project, the most interesting thing is that for the first time we will have an all-year-round port there, so we can forget about the ""winter delivery"" term. Right now talks are underway with Rosatom about constructing a personal icebreaker that would be used on our project, as well as three ice-class vessels that would deliver food and everything necessary all year round. This way we would provide for the continental part of Chukotka. In addition to this, we also have a road that connects our project with Yakutia. I mean this is an already existing road… Vladimir Putin: How many kilometres? Oleg Novachuk: About 250 km, if I am not mistaken. This means that Yakutia, this part of Yakutia, will also be connected with the port, and we will be able… Vladimir Putin: To deliver there for Yakutia, too. Oleg Novachuk: Yes, we can deliver everything for Yakutia, too. Right now we are working on other ideas involving the road that I would like to consult with you about. We are thinking about how we can build this, which companies we will attract to interact with Russian ones as much as possible. It is clear that Rosatom will provide 100 percent of maintenance, and we will try to work with Russian companies on the construction of roads and power lines, too. Vladimir Putin: Okay. Thank you. <…>"

As is traditional, the ceremony took place in the Alexander Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace.","Letters of credence were presented to the President of Russia by Lubomir Rehak (Slovak Republic), Dang Minh Khoi (Socialist Republic of Vietnam), Abdullahi Yibaikwal Shehu (Federal Republic of Nigeria), Maju Kake (Republic of Guinea), Hassan Abdi Daoud (Federal Republic of Somalia), Lesley Akyaa Opoku-Ware (Republic of Ghana), Werner Almhofer (Republic of Austria), Mohamed Mahmoud Dahi (Islamic Republic of Mauritania), Davlatshoh Gulmahmadzoda (Republic of Tajikistan), U Lwin Oo (Republic of the Union of Myanmar), Rodrigo de Lima Baena Soares (Federative Republic of Brazil), Augusto da Silva Cunha (Republic of Angola), Giorgio Starace (Italian Republic), Janitha Abewickrema Liyanage (Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka), Akambi Andre Okounlola-Biaou (Republic of Benin), Juan Fernando Holguin Flores (Republic of Ecuador), Rolando Enrique Barrow Noad (Republic of Panama), Yuri Pavel Santacruz Perdomo (Republic of El Salvador), Marcos Gomez Martinez (Kingdom of Spain), and Pavan Kapoor (Republic of India). * * * Speech at ceremony for presenting letters of credence President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. I am delighted to welcome you to the Kremlin. Due to the unfavourable pandemic situation, we have to hold the ceremony to present your letters of credence in this limited format. I hope you all understand. I am also happy to personally congratulate all of you on the official start of your diplomatic assignment in the Russian Federation and I wish you every success in fulfilling the honourable and responsible mission entrusted to you, to expand and strengthen ties between the states you represent and Russia. We are genuinely interested in your work being successful and rewarding. It goes without saying that you can fully count on the support and assistance of the Russian authorities, ministries and agencies, as well as on a benevolent attitude and constructive approach on the part of businesses, the political community and the public in Russia. I would like to express my confidence that your professional activity in Russia will involve interesting meetings, events, and contacts – well, this infection is bound to go away someday, we must defeat it and life must go back to normal. I really do hope that you will have opportunities to travel around our vast country on business and for pleasure, to get to know its multinational people, various religions, rich history and culture. And I hope that your stay in Russia will leave with the best impressions. Ladies and gentlemen, Recently, in my speech at the expanded meeting of the Foreign Ministry Board, I outlined the priorities of Russia's foreign policy and gave a detailed overview of the current difficult international situation, as well as approaches to settling acute global and regional problems. We are consistently pursuing the idea that it is possible to effectively cope with the numerous challenges and threats only through joint efforts of the entire global community. Developments around the coronavirus pandemic constantly remind us about this, too. The vile infection is far from defeated, and, of course, it will not be possible to tackle it in one single country. Unfortunately, in real life everything is different, and the term ""vaccine nationalism"" is already in use, which, alas, reflects the real state of affairs not only on the commercial vaccine market, but also in providing assistance to countries in need. In fact, I believe that without joining the efforts of all states, without establishing mutually beneficial and equal cooperation it will be impossible to address such difficult global problems and achieve success in fighting climate change, or countering terrorism and organised crime, or ensuring sustainable development. This is why we have called on all our international partners to act together, collectively, based on the central coordinating role of the United Nations and the founding principles of interstate communication envisaged in its Charter. At the same time, we express our concern not only over the fact that the international community is acting separately and cannot unite to address truly important problems, but also over how some of our partners are behaving towards our country, towards Russia, trying to restrain our development in every possible way, to exert sanctions pressure and, moreover, to escalate tensions near our borders. By the way, the threat on our western border is really growing, and we have mentioned it many times. It is enough to see how close NATO military infrastructure has moved to Russia's borders. This is more than serious for us. In this situation, we are taking appropriate military-technical measures. But, I repeat, we are not threatening anyone and it is at the very least irresponsible to accuse us of this, given the real state of affairs. This would mean laying the blame at the wrong door, as the Russian saying goes. In my speech at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs I already stressed that the priority facing Russian diplomacy at this juncture is to try to ensure that Russia is granted reliable and long-term security guarantees. While engaging in dialogue with the United States and its allies, we will insist on the elaboration of concrete agreements that would rule out any further eastward expansion of NATO and the deployment of weapons systems posing a threat to us in close proximity to Russia's territory. We suggest that substantive talks on this topic should be started. I would like to note in particular that we need precisely legal, juridical guarantees, because our Western colleagues have failed to deliver on verbal commitments they made. Specifically, everyone is aware of the assurances they gave verbally that NATO would not expand to the east. But they did absolutely the opposite in reality. In effect, Russia's legitimate security concerns were ignored and they continue to be ignored in the same manner even now. We are not demanding any special terms for ourselves. We understand that any agreements must take into account the interests of both Russia and all other states in the Euro-Atlantic region. A calm and stable situation should be ensured for everyone and is needed by all without exception. That said, I would like to stress that Russia is interested precisely in constructive collaboration and in equitable international cooperation, and this remains the central tenet of Russian foreign policy. I hope that you will convey this signal to the leaders of your states. Ladies and gentlemen, Heads of 20 diplomatic missions are present today at the ceremony. As per tradition, let me say a few words about the relations between Russia and every country you represent. We are interested in developing relations with the Slovak Republic on the principles of good neighbourly relations and mutual respect, considering the spiritual and cultural closeness of the two nations and common pages of history in fighting against Nazism. Unfortunately, today our political contacts are limited. However, if the Slovak side is ready, we could return to the mutually beneficial and constructive cooperation that our states supported for many years and that benefitted our nations. Russia and Vietnam's comprehensive strategic partnership covers the political, economic and cultural spheres as well as many others. During the useful and substantive talks with President Nguyen Xuan Phuc held yesterday, agreements were reached to further expand Russian-Vietnamese cooperation. The talks reaffirmed that the position of Russia and Vietnam on topical issues on the international agenda are quite similar or completely identical. The President of Vietnam is continuing his visit, and today he is having meetings with representatives of the Russian leadership, businesses, and public and political circles. An impressive package of documents that envisage implementation of large joint projects, including in the oil and gas sector, will be signed. We regard Nigeria as a key partner of Russia on the African continent, with whom we have traditionally friendly relations. We talked with President Muhammadu Buhari during the Russia-Africa Summit held in Sochi two years ago. We hope that the Nigerian leadership will support Russia's initiative to hold another meeting between the Russian and African leaders in 2022. As for specific areas of bilateral cooperation, we find expansion of the detailed dialogue on topical problems related to supporting stability on the global hydrocarbon markets, countering terrorism and religious extremism, to be quite promising. We hope that political life in the Republic of Guinea, a country friendly to Russia, will soon stabilise, and that national accord will be attained. For many years, Russia has been channelling substantial investment into the Guinean economy. Our companies have been producing and processing mineral commodities in Guinea for many years. It is now time to implement new interesting projects, including those in the sphere of energy, infrastructure, fisheries and agriculture. We advocate expanded cooperation with the Federal Republic of Somalia. Your Government is working actively to strengthen the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, it is fighting terrorism and extremism, striving to create favourable conditions for the socioeconomic revival. And, of course, we hope that all these efforts will be crowned with success. Our relations with the Republic of Ghana are developing steadily. We are expanding our interaction in the field of trade and energy, including the peaceful nuclear development. We jointly produce minerals and hydrocarbons. And, of course, we will continue to train professionals for various sectors of Ghana's economy. Russia and Austria are developing their relations on a constructive and pragmatic foundation, while relying on the principles of mutual respect and consideration for each other's interests. We are long-standing and reliable partners in the trade, investment and energy sphere. Mutual trade continues to expand despite the pandemic. In the first six months of 2021, bilateral trade soared by 26.5 percent, a very good indicator. This country values Austria's policy of permanent neutrality, as well as Vienna's authority as a generally recognised negotiating venue for multilateral diplomacy. There are favourable opportunities for expanding trade and economic ties with the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, including in the area of high-seas fisheries where we cooperate closely. We appreciate your country's substantial contribution to fighting terrorism in the Sahara-Sahel zone. Next year marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations with Tajikistan which is a good friend and reliable ally of Russia. This year, Tajik friends successfully presided in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the Collective Security Treaty Organisation. Our countries cooperate closely within the framework of these organisations and also within the Commonwealth of Independent States, and they coordinate their positions on topical regional matters. In view of the complicated situation in neighbouring Afghanistan, Russia is providing assistance to its Tajik friends in maintaining security, including under a programme to modernise the armed forces of Tajikistan. Ties between Russia and the Republic of the Union of Myanmar are traditionally friendly. We believe that our joint efforts can further develop our successful cooperation in the economic, military-technical and educational spheres. We are in favour of resolving the problems related to the tense internal political and ethno-religious situation in the country without outside interference, by the Myanmar themselves, on the basis of a political dialogue. Brazil is an important strategic partner of Russia. We work together at the BRICS forum and G20. Given the fact that in 2022–2023 your country will become a non-permanent member of the [United Nations] Security Council, we will cooperate more intensely at the UN on the topical issues on the global agenda. In addition to this, we will continue to progressively strengthen bilateral cooperation in the trade, economic, energy, scientific, and technological spheres, and others. We will be glad to see the President of Brazil in Russia. Friendly relations with the Republic of Angola have withstood the test of time. What matters most is that, together with our Angolan friends, we intend to fully develop our comprehensive cooperation, to promote our political dialogue and carry on our joint work in trade, investment, and culture among other things. In particular, these things were discussed during the Angolan Foreign Minister's visit to Russia in October. The relations with the Republic of Italy are built on our strong traditions of cooperation, close historical and cultural ties, as well as a sincere liking between the two nations. This year, Italy has successfully presided in G20 and held quite a fruitful summit of the group dedicated to countering the pandemic, restoring the global economy, and preserving the climate. We provided our comprehensive support to Italy's presidency. We have regular telephone conversations with Prime Minister Draghi to discuss current issues on the international, regional and bilateral agenda. Let me mention that this year, the implementation of a large joint initiative, the Cross Year of Museums, continues in the cultural field. Next year, we will mark the 65th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations with Sri Lanka. Good contacts have been established between foreign ministries, defence ministries and ministries of the economic bloc, as well as between parliaments. By the way, the Secretary of Russia's Security Council Nikolai Patrushev has just visited Colombo, on November 22. Since 2009, Sri Lanka has been involved in the work of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation as a dialogue partner, and it contributes to efforts facilitating the security of the Eurasian region and its sustainable socioeconomic growth. We continue to expand our interaction with the Republic of Benin. Notably, we are drafting an intergovernmental agreement on military cooperation and a memorandum of understanding in the area of sport. Russian companies are interested in participating in joint geological prospecting, energy and infrastructure projects in Benin. Ecuador ranks among Russia's three largest Latin American trade partners. Stable supplies of Russian hydrocarbons are an important factor in the sustainable development of the Ecuadorean economy. In turn, Ecuador's diverse agricultural produce is quite popular on the Russian market. In August 2021, I had a telephone conversation with President of the Republic of Ecuador, Mr Guillermo Lasso, and we agreed to further promote bilateral ties, to maintain proactive political dialogue and expand interdepartmental contacts, including those between the prosecutor general's offices and emergency response services and to help implement joint projects in various fields. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of official diplomatic relations between Russia and the Republic of Panama, and we are determined to continue our political contacts, as well as trade and investment and cultural-humanitarian cooperation. Russian businesses are attracted to Panama, a major logistic and financial centre, making it possible to deliver goods, services and capital to the entire vast Latin American region. Next year, we will mark the 30th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations with the Republic of El Salvador. We have established friendly and equitable interaction with this country, as well as traditions of mutually beneficial cooperation in various sectors. An intergovernmental cooperation agreement on joint anti-crime efforts, especially those aiming to fight organised crime, is at the ratification stage. Russia is helping El Salvador to develop its hydropower industry. We are interested in further expanding our trade and economic cooperation, as well as educational and professional exchanges. We attach great importance to contacts and cooperation with Spain, and they are progressing nicely. Next year, we will jointly celebrate the 45th anniversary of restoring diplomatic relations. It should be noted that despite the pandemic, bilateral trade is improving. Joint projects are moving forward, mutually beneficial dialogue is being maintained at the political level, as are very active business and cultural ties. Next week, I will visit India. During talks with Prime Minister Modi, we will outline new large-scale initiatives for the further development of the especially privileged Russian-Indian relationship, the Russian-Indian strategic partnership. This partnership brings real mutual benefit to both states. Bilateral trade shows good dynamics; ties are actively developing in the energy sector, innovation, space, and the production of coronavirus vaccines and medicines. There is extensive cooperation in the defence sector, including through the creation of joint ventures. India is one of the authoritative centres of the multipolar world with a foreign policy philosophy and priorities that are closely aligned with our own. I am convinced that, relying on strong traditions of friendship and mutual understanding, we will continue working together to expand the full range of Russian-Indian ties. Ladies and gentlemen, I just briefly touched on Russia's relations with the states you represent. I hope that with your active participation, these relations will be filled with new content, mutually beneficial projects, useful initiatives and, in general, will make rapid progress for the benefit of the people of our countries and in the interests of international security and stability. I wish you success, good health and all the best. I am not sure, it is unlikely that we will be able to meet before the New Year in this composition – the New Year is just around the corner. So, Happy New Year! Thank you for your attention. Thank you very much."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67245,Meeting with VTB CEO Andrei Kostin,2021-12-01T08:30:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow","Yesterday evening, Vladimir Putin had a meeting with President and Chairman of VTB Bank Management Board Andrei Kostin.","President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Kostin, shall we start with this year's performance? President and Chairman of VTB Bank Management Board Andrei Kostin Kostin AndreiVTB Bank Chairman: Yes, Mr President. We have achieved good results and expect record high profits that are likely to exceed 300 billion rubles. I think that the main reason for this is mostly the favourable economic situation in the country, including high growth rates, growth of incomes, and a surge in our clients' profits. On the whole, it is a good and favourable situation. The second reason is that we have implemented an in-depth digital transformation at the bank, the so-called 600 Days programme, which has put the bank at the level of most advanced banking technologies. This, of course, has boosted the effectiveness and profitability of our work. If we take other indices, the real sector lending portfolio has increased by eight percent over the first ten months of this year. We have actively joined the programme of aid to small and medium-sized businesses, the so-called FOT 3.0(Payroll Fund), which was launched, pursuant to your instructions, on November 1. This programme makes it possible for small and medium-sized businesses to retain their employees. The VTB Bank accounts for almost a quarter of all loans under this programme. As for our outreach efforts, the bank's lending portfolio has grown by 18.4 percent, predominantly due to mortgages, which are in huge demand, even despite the trend towards higher interest rates. For the first time, we have lent one trillion roubles within 11 months, which has enabled some 300,000 families to move into better housing. We are actively using the state preferential-rate mortgage programmes, with approximately a quarter of all mortgage loans being in the government-subsidised preferential category. Right now, we are introducing new products, such as the so-called eco-mortgages involving a 1.6 percent reduction in the interest rate, provided a lender buys housing conforming to the highest environmental standards. We will develop this trend. Actually, we recently approved a new strategy for the bank's sustainable development at a supervisory board meeting. This will become our main action plan in the long-term. Vladimir Putin: What kind of a strategy is this? Andrei Kostin: We prioritise two main areas, namely, the environment and the social dimension. The environment has now become something fashionable, and everyone is rushing to deal with this matter. We believe that the social aspects of the activities of any company or bank are no less important and, maybe, even more important than the environment. What do I mean? We are developing a number of social products to support, first and foremost, the least protected strata of the population– senior citizens and children. For example, we provide senior citizens with free insurance from all types of fraud, they are the most vulnerable category of the population. Vladimir Putin: They are trusting. Andrei Kostin: They are trusting. To the best of our knowledge, instead of using high-tech systems, confidence tricksters simply resort to telephone calls, and they persuade these people. We also pay certain bonuses and additional sums to senior citizens when they open an account. Besides, we stipulate additional bonuses for children when the state remits the so-called school payments, and we have also introduced free oncology-risk insurance for children. About 50,000 children have already received these insurance policies. So, we will be working hard. Regarding the environmental dimension, we are working actively with""green"" bonds, and we have issued such bonds worth 140 billion rubles since early 2021. Next year, we are planning to start trading in carbon units together with the Moscow Exchange. This will become a new and very promising market. We remain mindful about our traditional forms, and our clients can plant trees with just a few clicks. Four million trees have already been planted. And I would like to recall that you planted over 1,000 pines in the Irkutsk Region in April 2018. Before coming here, I inspected them, those pines are growing well, they are already absorbing carbon dioxide, and everything is all right. Vladimir Putin: Mr Kostin, I would also like to thank you for facilitating the bank's cost-effective development, for ensuring its highly significant status for the country's economy, and I would like to congratulate your entire team on their successful performance this year. Andrei Kostin: Thank you, Mr President. Thank you very much. <…>"

Following the talks, a joint statement was adopted reflecting a shared vision for developing the comprehensive strategic partnership between the Russian Federation and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam until 2030.*** President of Russia President Vladimir Putin: Comrade President, I am very happy to see you, welcome. We take part in various online events, but I am glad to see you here in Russia in such a normal way. This year we already celebrated the anniversary of our Declaration of Strategic Partnership, but relations between Russia and Vietnam run much deeper than the decades that we have lived under this memorandum. We remember this, we truly value the level of our strategic partnership with Vietnam. It must be said that our relations exist in the context of present circumstances. Despite the pandemic, trade between our countries increased by more than 15 percent last year, and by more than 16 percent over the first nine months of this year. The itinerary of your visit to Russia is quite packed and ambitious. I know you have prepared a package of important documents in various fields concerning both economic and cultural cooperation. I am very happy to see you. Please convey my best wishes to the Secretary General of the Communist Party of Vietnam– we are also in touch. Our foreign ministries maintain regular contact. We have similar positions on many international issues, we constantly work within the UN and regional organisations. Vietnam remains our reliable, loyal friend and strategic partner. It is a pleasure to see you. President of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam Nguyen Xuan Phuc(retranslated): Comrade Vladimir Putin, As you rightly said, it is also always a great joy for us to meet with you here in Moscow. It is remarkable that our current visit is taking place on the 80th anniversary, to the day, of the parade on Red Square. After this parade, Red Army soldiers marched directly to the front and eventually liberated all Europe from Nazism. We all remember this righteous struggle of the Russian people. We have always had special feelings for Russia and take great joy in the enormous achievements made by Russia under your leadership over the past 20 years. We are confident that with your vast experience you will continue leading Russia to success and prosperity. We would like to make special mention of Russia's achievements in developing the economy and raising its status in the international arena. We know perfectly well that it was you who reclaimed and upheld Russia's international status and we, the entire leadership of Vietnam, are very happy about this. We always view Russia as a very important foreign policy priority, a close friend and partner. Before this visit to Russia, General Secretary NguyenPhu Trong discussed the status of bilateral relations with me for a very long time. We always strive to maintain and build on the traditionally friendly relations between Vietnam and Russia. I would also like to tell you that before my visit to Russia, I instructed our Deputy Prime Minister Le Van Thanh to work, in cooperation with his Russian colleague, on advancing cooperation in different areas, especially in the Intergovernmental Commission. We intend to strengthen good political relations between our countries and facilitate the resolution of specific problems in bilateral cooperation with a view to taking our ties to a new level. I can say that we are trying very hard to resolve the issues where Russia has an interest. There are grounds to say that we have managed to resolve a lot of them. We realise that our problems in bilateral relations are technical or procedural for the most part. But we also understand that they must be resolved and we will do all we can to expedite the solution of these problematic issues. We are striving to create the most favourable conditions for the work of our companies in order to take our relations to a new, more substantive, and higher level. Vladimir Putin: We will adopt a statement today. I think it will also reflect the level, the status of our relations. We will continue moving forward. Nguyen Xuan Phuc: As you rightly said, this joint statement is very important. We believe such statements facilitate the long-term development of our relationship. We also need other framework agreements and statements that will become guideposts for bilateral cooperation. I am very happy that we have managed to coordinate this highly important document. It contains many specific items that are important for our relations in the short- and long-term perspective. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. <…>"

Investment Forum, via videoconference.","The 13th VTB Capital Russia Calling! Investment Forum is being held online on November 30-December 1, 2021. Its central theme is Rethinking Priorities, Embracing Sustainability.*** President and Chairman of VTB Bank Management Board Andrei Kostin Kostin AndreiVTB Bank Chairman: Mr President, colleagues, I am delighted to welcome you to the 13th VTB Capital Russia Calling! Investment Forum. This is our 13th forum, as I said, and it is being held online for the second year. Do you know what we have found out? Every cloud has a silver lining, as the saying goes. Earlier, our auditorium accommodated 2,500 investors, and over 1,000 people arrived from abroad. Last year, three million people, including 180,000 foreign participants and audiences who were able to attend our session online, watched our forum. I am therefore confident that we will also return to the offline format, but, of course, we will continue to take advantage of the opportunities created by the internet to ensure the broadest possible coverage, because people are tremendously interested in our forum, primarily because President Vladimir Putin is speaking here. We have already held a session on macroeconomics this morning. Our ministers, including the Economic Development Minister, the Finance Minister and the Central Bank Governor, took the floor, and representatives of the business community also took part. It was very interesting. Sometimes, I get the impression that the very history of our businesspeople testifies to the Russian economy's capabilities more vividly than any words. One of the speakers at the session, Tatyana Bakalchuk, the mother of many children, came up with an idea for an online company called Wildberries during maternity leave. Today she is the sole owner of this company, which has a capitalisation of US$13 billion. This is an example of a new Russian economy which is being created with the use of new digital technologies and that has nothing to do with oil and gas. This is an amazing success story. I think this discussion was also very interesting. Today, we begin our main session. It will start with an address by President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin, and after that we will have the opportunity to ask your questions and get the questions. Thank you. Mr President, you have the floor. President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, First, I would like to welcome all of you to the Russia Calling! Investment Forum. By tradition, it has gathered domestic and foreign investors and experts to discuss current issues on the business agenda, key trends that determine the development and investment potential of individual business areas, markets and even whole countries. Of course, the coronavirus pandemic has been in the focus of the world's attention for almost two years. There is nothing we can do about this. Its impact on investment, business and cooperation ties is great. It is affecting the entire global economy. I would like to note that the economy is gradually recovering nonetheless. However, the rates of this recovery are in question and everyone knows why– it is yet another wave of the disease caused by a new coronavirus strain. This compels governments all over the world to resort to restrictions again. In the next few weeks, we will find out how serious the consequences triggered by the new strain are. But it is explicitly clear that we must be ready for any change in the virus. First, it is necessary to continuously monitor the efficiency of tests and vaccines and use clear-cut algorithms for reducing the spread of infection. The healthcare system must be on high alert; it must have enough reserves of medications, oxygen and beds and use the most effective treatment protocols. I would like to ask the Government– I address my colleagues in the Government of the Russian Federation– to prepare within a week an updated plan of action to counter the risks of the spread of the new coronavirus strain. At the same time, considering the global cross-border nature of the disease, we can give an effective response to the pandemic only if we work together– I have said this many times, and not only I. Appeals to pool efforts in fighting this infection are voiced in the United Nations all the time. It is only possible to counter it effectively by coordinating the efforts of the entire international community. I am referring to mutual recognition of vaccines and vaccination certificates, access to vaccines in all regions of the planet and joint work on new anti-coronavirus medications. I am sure it is hardly possible to counter this idea. The understanding of shared responsibility, especially by the leaders of the world's most advanced countries, will become a foundation for more vigorous joint actions. As for the economic agenda proper, a distinctive feature of the current situation is the high inflationary pressure; the world is entering a new wave of the pandemic with this. As experts, as direct participants in global economic affairs, you are well aware that the rise in prices is due to a whole range of reasons that added up. In particular, consumer demand for services such as tourism, transport and public catering recently has subsided and shifted towards goods, and everyone is well aware of that. At the same time, the closed borders and the COVID-19 restrictions have disrupted many supply chains; there is a shortage of certain goods, and this is pushing prices up. There is another significant factor that accelerated inflation, perhaps even played a key role– the extremely soft budgetary policy in most developed countries, the growing budget deficits, a trend that persists this year, which means that global inflationary risks are still out there. Indeed, a substantial infusion of funds into the economy have helped them support people and business in difficult times, and we also do this in Russia, but at the same time, injecting money on a global scale, so to speak, provoked a surge in prices on global markets, including commodities markets. We are witnessing a major crisis breaking out in the global energy market. The first thing it did was send up prices of nitrogen fertilisers, something agricultural producers around the world need as one of the key resources for maintaining soil fertility and stable yields. It is obvious that this situation creates risks for further growth in food prices. Wheat prices have risen sharply on global markets over the past month. According to experts, this trend may continue. Unfortunately, Russia and Russians are also feeling this global inflationary pressure. The growth of consumer prices in our country has accelerated, largely under the influence of external factors. This is a serious and sensitive problem for the people, especially for low-income families, and addressing it requires the utmost attention. It is important not only to deal with the consequences of inflation, but also to act proactively and to remove the factors that are driving prices up. We are already providing targeted support to manufacturers of the goods that are most susceptible to abrupt price fluctuations, primarily, food. And here again I want the Government and our colleagues in the regions to keep in mind the fact that an increase in output and an increase in availability of food on the domestic market are the key performance criteria in this area. We have also expanded financial aid to citizens with low incomes. This year, we made one-time payments to pensioners and families with schoolchildren, and we are launching new measures to support families with children. Next year, we will re-adjust the subsistence level and the minimum wage, as well as social benefits. These decisions have already been taken. Of course, this is not an exhaustive list of measures to support the people. Based on our financial capabilities, we will work through other solutions in this regard. At the same time, it is important to maintain a responsible approach in the macroeconomic sphere. Notably, Russia was the first among major economies to normalise its budgetary policy amid the pandemic. Starting next year, we will strictly follow the budgetary rule when forming and executing the federal budget. Also, all the measures to support the people that we are implementing remain within the budgetary parameters and are carried out at the expense of extra budget revenue and redistribution of its expenditure. Thus, they have no inflationary implications. With regard to monetary policy, the Bank of Russia continues to stay the course of curbing inflation and timely and proper regulation of the banking sector. Thanks to responsible and well-calculated actions by the state and businesses, the Russian economy has already exceeded the pre-crisis level. In January-September, the GDP increased by 4.6 percent. It is expected to grow by 4.2 percent as of the year end. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.3 percent in September which is just what it was before the pandemic broke out. Today, we can safely assume that the labour market in Russia has fully recovered which, notably, we cannot yet say about many leading economies around the world. Our strategic goal is to support and consolidate positive trends in the Russian economy, to ensure its sustainable and lasting growth or, as experts say, to boost the potential rates of economic growth. Considering the lessons of the epidemic, current global challenges, and Russia's natural competitive advantages, we are determining points of growth for capital investment. Importantly, we want this investment to produce a comprehensive effect for the branches of the national economy and the country's regions, primarily, for increasing the incomes and the living standards of our people. At this point, I would like to draw your attention to several key areas. First, our long-term priority is the growth of the share of infrastructure investment in the GDP. We have launched a powerful instrument for the development of territories– 15-year-long infrastructure budget loans at 3 percent interest. These are very good terms for our economy. In the next two years, the additional amount of work on the projects carried out with the help of this instrument is expected to exceed half a trillion rubles. We will spend these funds on building roads, networks and communications systems– everything that provides comfortable living conditions and allows us to create jobs, open new production lines and launch advanced projects. These efforts are not merely effective from an economic point of view, but have a positive impact on the environment and create new opportunities for the self-fulfillment of people in all regions of the country. I have already said that the programme of infrastructure budget loans will last at least until 2026. We will determine its precise scale a bit later with due account for the experience gained and the readiness of new projects, as well as the technological and production capabilities of our construction industry, which are certainly rapidly building up. We will draft simple and understandable procedures here in order to build quickly, reliably, with high quality, in a modern way and without losses and encumbrances. I would like to note one more important decision. There are plans to allocate 2.5 trillion rubles from the National Wealth Fund(NWF) through 2024. These funds will be invested on a refundable basis in major investment projects, primarily, in infrastructure, and will certainly let us attract additional private investment. At any rate, we are hoping it will. Second, we support investment aimed at making positive social and environmental changes in our country, which meets the sustainable development goals that Russia plans to achieve. Experts have already drafted a legal framework for launching green projects that will allow us to reduce harmful emissions substantially. Starting July 1, everything will be ready in Russia for launching climate initiatives of businesses, including foreign companies. They are very important for our economy to reach carbon neutrality by 2060. We have already announced this, in Glasgow, in particular. The new programme to improve the economy's energy efficiency is going to play an important role. The Government should complete its preparation by October 1, 2022. We will vigorously develop the infrastructure for investments in sustainable development, and stimulate the inflow of private capital in this area. I ask the Government, as well as the Bank of Russia and the business community, to work out a range of appropriate financial instruments, including tax incentives, subsidies, and government guarantees for enterprises and investors. At the same time, I would like to note that several current projects are already enjoying this kind of support, but again, it is important to make this work systematic. Third. Digital transformation, the introduction of new technologies in all spheres should give a boost to the development of the national economy, should increase labour productivity and people's incomes. Even today, Russia is one of the global leaders in the use of digital services and the development of artificial intelligence technologies. We are also well aware that it is important to ensure a balanced development of digital ecosystems, and to define the role of financial institutions there. Let me remind you that such ecosystems are centered on an individual and their so-called digital profile. And, as I emphasised at a recent international conference on artificial intelligence, it is essential to determine a correct model for processing large amounts of information, to ensure the absolute protection and security of personal data, and in general, in a broader sense, the protection of people's rights and freedoms. Fourth. The banking sector and the stock market play an important role in the recovery of the Russian economy and in putting it on a long-term growth trajectory. Thanks to their strong financial position, Russian banks are now increasing lending to the real sector. Our host, the organiser of this event, can certainly confirm this. You probably have already spoken about this a lot. It is important to further increase the availability of lending resources to sustainable, growing firms and companies that need funds to boost production and create new well-paid jobs. At the same time, banks should carefully assess potential borrowers' credit quality, regardless of their form of ownership. I will add that, relying on fundamental macroeconomic factors, Russian stock indices have exceeded their pre-pandemic levels, and Russian bond and equity offering is growing. We will make our platforms more attractive, for foreign investors, among others. Notably, the securities market has become more accessible for small and medium-sized businesses. This year, the volume of bond placements by these companies amounted to 7.6 billion rubles. We will take further action to develop this capital mobilisation tool and provide overall support to small businesses by offering innovative solutions. Thus, small and medium-sized businesses now get a refund on bank commissions when selling goods and services to individual customers. This procedure is convenient for businesses and beneficial for the consumers, and will remain in place until the end of this year. I believe it should be extended for at least another six months. There is one more important issue. The Russian stock market is actively attracting funds from individual investors. Over nine months, their investments grew by more than a quarter, which adds stability to the securities market and makes it more attractive. This resource should not only become a major source of financing for investment projects, but also work reliably for individual investors and generate a steady flow of income for the people who are willing to invest long-term in the Russian economy. In this regard, I want the Government to draft additional proposals to this end, including deductions from tax on capital gains from long-term investment in Russian securities. We are doing this for bank deposits to protect private deposits, and this tool is, of course, much sought after. I also propose thinking about the co-financing of such savings by the state. At the same time, I would like to point out that market fluctuations and retracements are part of the stock market. Once again, I would like to stress that it is necessary to protect the interests of citizens and guarantee the safety of their savings. In fact, we are talking about a mechanism that is similar, as I mentioned earlier, to the bank deposit insurance system. Please work through this solution. I know that, overall, the Government sees this as a good idea, is thinking about it, and already has come up with some solutions. Colleagues, I would like to end my opening remarks here. I will be happy to listen to what you have to say, your thoughts, comments or suggestions on what you think about working in Russia, what difficulties or problems you have, what you would like us to know, and what advice you have for us. We always heed your recommendations. Thank you very much. President and Chairman of VTB Bank Management Board Andrei Kostin: Thank you very much, Mr President. We have investors online today from diverse regions: the US, Great Britain, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. However, I would like to give the opportunity of asking the first question to Chief Executive Officer of the Qatar Investment Authority Mansoor bin Ebrahim Al-Mahmoud because he is a major shareholder of ours. In 2013, Qatar's sovereign wealth fund purchased half a billion dollars' worth of VTB shares and subsequently invested hundreds of millions in our projects. It is Pulkovo's biggest stakeholder, and we are looking forward to the government commission's decision– which should be affirmative– on QIA buying nearly 25 percent of the Western High Speed Diameter(you attended the opening of this road, it is a high-speed motorway in St Petersburg), and so it is actively involved in infrastructure projects in Petersburg. I would like to give the floor to Mr al-Mahmoud first. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Yes, please. Mansoor bin Ebrahim Al-Mahmoud: Thank you, President Putin. Thank you, Chairman Kostin. My name is Mansoor Al-Mahmoud, CEO of QIA. Mr President, we have been very active investing in the Russian economy, in a range of different industries: banking, retail, energy, and so on. I have a very simple question for you, Mr President. Given all the current geopolitical challenges facing the world, from COVID-19 to climate change, or from sanctions to bilateral relations, I would like to ask you what are the issues that keep you awake at night? And, from your experience, what are the best ways to address them and to ensure Russia's continuing economic prosperity? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: I have already attempted to say it in my introductory remarks. Indeed, Russia is encountering the same problems the rest of the world is facing– climate change, the coronavirus, which stifles economic activity, cuts down on opportunities for travel, personal meetings and so forth, inflation. Meanwhile, I have just said that we nevertheless managed to organise work in such a way that we are returning to pre-pandemic levels in the crucial macroeconomic indicators. One of them is unemployment declining to 4.3 percent. It was slightly higher before the pandemic here. If memory serves, it was 4.7, whereas now it is 4.3 percent. Our economy is growing at 4.7 percent of the GDP this year. It is not the world's highest, we are aware of that, yet it is a fairly good number for us. And the key is that we are trying to do everything based on the principles of macroeconomic policy. It is important to take the necessary decisions in due time, to analyse the outcome of the decisions made and to proceed from them in developing new plans. This does not mean that the only thing we are thinking about is keeping up appearances on paper, no. We understand perfectly well that everything related to the current problems affects the people. Therefore, we are trying to take balanced decisions here too, both regarding support for the economy and its worst-affected areas above all(I am not going to list them, you know them all too well), and citizens, especially those categories who need state support. They are the elderly, pensioners and families with children. I have already said that we raised the minimum wage and subsistence minimum. It will all affect a whole range of benefits that are all calculated based on those minimums. And now regarding the main thing. We do not overlook strategic development issues while addressing current ones. We definitely want to support the transformation of our economy on a digital platform, we want to ensure the necessary amount of investment by investing ourselves on behalf of the state, primarily in infrastructure. We hope our investors will appreciate all our efforts, will trust our plans and will co-invest– the way our Qatari friends are doing. Andrei Kostin: Thank you very much, Mr President. Colleagues, please, who is next? I am being insistent as many people want to ask a question. Please, who is next? Oleg Kuzmin: Good afternoon, I am Oleg Kuzmin from the London-based Pharo Management investment fund. Thank you very much for the opportunity to take part in the discussion. Mr President, I want to ask the following question: back in the early 2000s, the Russian economy was growing fast and modern state institutions were being restored or created. Over the next 10 to 12 years, until the present day, Russia regularly faced sensitive external shocks, including plummeting oil prices, global financial or epidemiological crises, like the one now, and sanctions. However, despite these shocks, Russia has managed to significantly increase the sustainability of its economy, and now there is a popular saying among international investors, particularly investors in debt instruments– in bonds– that Russia has built a sort of economic fortress among developing countries. You have already identified key areas of future work but still I want to ask, in this context, the following question: what do you see as the top priority for the socioeconomic development of Russia in the next ten years? Now, indeed, the balance of payments and financial standing are favourable and the mechanisms for effectively mitigating, as much as possible, the impact of external factors on the country's economy have been put in place, including budget rules and inflation targeting. Generally, it looks like a fortress has really been built. What is next? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Our colleague from Qatar has just asked me:""What keeps you awake at night?"" In the sense,""What is your greatest concern?"" We have domestic issues typical of Russia, primarily demographic problems. We had two natural declines in our demographic development: during World War II or the Great Patriotic War, as we call it, in 1943–1944, and in the early and middle 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union. There was an equal drop in the birth rate. It was the lowest in 1999– I believe a little over 1,200,000. In 2006, we already had almost two million births– more than 1,900,000. This problem has acquired a systemic and economic character due to the shortage of workforce in the labour market. We have a little over 80 million there and our losses amount to 1.1–1.2 percent a year. In this context, demographics is one of our main problems both for humanitarian and economic considerations, and because we need to strengthen our statehood as well. I will not enumerate all the measures and instruments we are using and intend to continue using in the future in order to tackle this problem. In general, we managed to get things moving in the recent past. Overall, we understand what we can do and know how to do it. Of course, this miserable disease has unfortunately increased the death rate and this has demographic effects as well. To repeat, we had these natural drops in 1943, 1944 and the 1990s. This is the first problem that we must resolve. We must make the digital transition, which I would describe as crosscutting and total in both the economy and state government. You said we have built an economic fortress. If they say so, it is good but we are not striving to build fortresses and to live within the fortress walls. We are simply raising the level of our sovereignty, including economic self-sufficiency, and we will certainly strive to achieve this. But we will also strive to achieve this in cooperation with our partners the world over– wherever there is the desire for it. Andrei Kostin: Thank you. Next question, please. Guido Chamorro: Guido Chamorro from Pictet Asset Management. I have the pleasure to be here in this forum. As investors, analysing the macro fundamentals of the Russian economy, such as growth, inflation and debt levels, is no longer enough. Our players are now asking us to also incorporate environmental, social and governance issues when assessing the risk of investing in Russia. Mr President, what message would you like to convey to the international community that may want to continue investing in Russia but must also implement and assess sustainability? And besides some of the measures on the environmental side, as you mentioned, carbon neutrality by 2060, are there any specific government policies that you would like to highlight, that may improve Russia's ESG profile going forward? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: We realise how the world is developing, where it is heading and what the basic criteria for today's investment flows are. The ESG is a comprehensive aggregated indicator of how a state plans its development in the near-term, mid-term and more remote perspective. Naturally, people must be at the centre of attention when it comes to development. The Russian Federation is aware of this and not only because it wants to stay on trend but also because the foundation of our policy, our entire policy, is focused on the people. At any rate, this is what we aspire to. Sometimes we do not succeed but we are committed to working for this. What does this mean? It means that we must improve healthcare and look after the environment. If we set the goal of decarbonising our economy by 2060, we will consistently, incrementally work toward this goal. Maybe this looks modest at first sight because other countries set more ambitious goals for themselves. However, I have every reason to believe that we can also achieve these goals sooner if we do everything as planned. We have a whole set of tools to reduce the carbon footprint of our economy. We can make better use of the absorbing capacity of our forests and ecosystems in general. This means we should take better care of them, fight wildfires better and plant new forests where the old ones are gone, and so on. This entire package, including the modernisation of the economy and, as I have already mentioned, the transition to complete digitisation, allows us to say that we do not merely support all UN-formulated criteria for sustainable development but are also playing a most active role in work with other countries to this end. I am sure our investors will see this. Moreover, if they take part in our work, they will be on trend. The transition, or our contribution to the development of alternative energy sources, to hydrogen energy, in the near future, and so on, will meet the expectations that the world has for us, whether it is the official authorities of the world's leading economies or the investors that play a direct role in global economic development. So, we are speaking the same language and understand each other. Andrei Kostin: Mr President, may I ask a sensitive question related to this issue? Yesterday Rossiyskaya Gazeta published a survey conducted by the famous Swiss bank Credit Suisse, according to which GHG emissions are generated not only by enterprises and the economy in general, but also by people. To reduce the carbon footprint to the target set out in the Paris Agreement, 2.9 tonnes per capita a year, people must abandon coffee, beer and meat, use gyms and treadmills for only 30 minutes three times a week, and take one flight a year. But personal hygiene is the worst part: they should have eight-minute showers three times a week, flush the toilet twice a day, and use washing machines and dishwashers for only two hours per week. Only under these conditions will a person meet the greenhouse gas emissions target. Would you like to live like that, in such a world? Vladimir Putin: I would like to live in a world where personal hygiene does not damage the environment, where we will make flights on non-polluting aircraft and our food is produced and utilised in the appropriate way. You see, Mr Kostin, any target can be achieved if we do not approach the matter mindlessly but as persons who think about finding solutions rather than explanations or justification for their failure to attain the goals set. If we work towards this result, we will achieve it. Andrei Kostin: Mr President, that is absolutely right. Nevertheless, I suggest that the carbon footprint should be increased for the heads of state to at least 6–10 tonnes per year, considering the specifics of their work. Vladimir Putin: Well, thank you. Andrei Kostin: Next, please. Jacob Grapengiesser: Jacob Grapengiesser, East Capital. You have mentioned red lines in relations between Russia and Ukraine several times. In a way, the issue is also connected with the West and NATO. Can you clarify where these red lines run and what can be the consequences of crossing them? Should investors anticipate a potential deployment of Russian troops in Ukraine? Vladimir Putin: Regarding the potential deployment of Russian troops in Ukraine, the rumour first appeared in early 2021, when we held the Zapad 2021 military exercises, but, as we know, nothing happened. The point at issue is not to deploy or not to deploy troops, to fight or not to fight. The point at issue is to develop relations aimed at fairer and more stable development based on respect for the security interests of all the participants in international affairs. If we work towards this sincerely, nobody will feel any threats. As for the threats, the people living in the two so far unrecognised republics– the Lugansk and Donetsk people's republics, threats are regularly created there by the movement of the military contingents near their territory. This is the second point. Third, the Russian Federation also has certain apprehensions regarding the large-scale military exercises held near its border, including unscheduled ones, like the recent Black Sea drills during which strategic bombers, which are known to carry precision and possibly even nuclear weapons, made flights within 20 kilometres of our border. All this is posing a threat to us. As for the red lines, they are largely hypothetical. Nevertheless, take a look at what has been going on for the past 20 years: relations between Russia and the Western community, the collective West, were nearly cloudless in the 1990s and early 2000s. Why did they need to enlarge NATO towards our border? What for? Who can answer this question? There is no reasonable answer; it does not exist. Our relationship was almost idyllic, especially in the mid-1990s, when we nearly became allies. However, despite all our warnings, conversations and requests, the[bloc's] infrastructure ultimately approached our border. The situation went as far as the deployment of BMD systems in Poland and Romania, and the launchers that have been stationed there, the Mk 41, can be used to launch Tomahawk missiles and other strike systems. This is creating a threat to us– this is an obvious fact. What has happened in response to all our appeals and requests not to do this? You can see it now. As a result, we had to– I want to stress this– we had to reciprocate by launching the creation of hypersonic weapons. This was our response. But we were not the first to start all this– it all began when our partners withdrew from the ABM Treaty and later from the INF treaty. You have asked about Ukraine and where the red lines run. They are, above all, the threats to us that can come from that territory. If the enlargement, the infrastructure continues to be enlarged– I have said this publicly, but you are businesspeople and may not have the time to follow this, I will repeat this once again that the issue concerns the possible deployment in the territory of Ukraine of strike systems with the flight time of 7–10 minutes to Moscow, or 5 minutes in the case of hypersonic systems. Just imagine that. Incidentally, you live in Moscow, as far as I know. East Capital is in Moscow, isn't it? The flight time to Moscow is 5 minutes[for these systems]. Jacob Grapengiesser: Yes, I have been living in Moscow for the past 15 years. Vladimir Putin: So, what should we do? We would need to create similar systems to be used against those who are threatening us. Can you imagine that? But we can do this already now, because we have held successful tests, and early next year we will put a new sea-launched hypersonic missile with a maximum speed of Mach 9 on combat duty. The flight time to those who issue orders will also be 5 minutes. Where are we heading? Why are we doing this? The creation of such threats for us is the red line. I hope it will not come to this. I hope that common sense and responsibility for one's country and the international community will prevail after all. Andrei Kostin: Regrettably, such fake news is affecting the market. Our stock market has grown by over 30 percent this year. Of course, investors did well, but now the market plunged by 11 percent because of this fake news about Ukraine, this fake news alone. Regrettably, this is having a serious impact indeed on the market. Vladimir Putin: This may be done on purpose, so as to make a profit from this, and then the market will surge again. They are making money from a falling market. Andrei Kostin: Yes, this is possible. We cannot rule this out. Please. Oliver Weeks: Oliver Weeks from Brevan Howard in London. Mr President, since you returned to the presidency, we have seen in Russia stagnation of real household incomes, rising inequality, and you have had to apply more and more open political repression. If you plan to stay as president after cancelling term limits, do you think that less austere fiscal policy might be a better way to preserve your support? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Regarding the start of my presidency and the falling incomes, it is true that there has been a certain decrease in incomes during the past few years because of the pandemic. There is nothing unusual in that. This has happened in nearly all countries. As for the start of my presidency, the situation is opposite now: nearly 40 million people lived below the poverty line then. Many of them, 20 million, still do, but the figure has, nevertheless, decreased by half. In this sense, our economy has changed, and people's incomes have changed radically in a positive sense. But once again, we know very well that, due to growing inflation and food inflation, which is also growing, personal incomes are dwindling. In these circumstances, we are conducting a well-targeted policy to support the economy and maintain the employment rate, on the one hand, to make sure that people can work and earn money. On the other hand, we are providing targeted support to specific categories of the population that need government assistance. As I said, these are primarily senior people and families with children. I am not going to list the entire package of support measures but, for example, when it comes to families with children, we start with supporting pregnant women, then children under three, then children aged three to seven, seven to sixteen, single-parent families and so on. We have not finalised this package and it will be improved and expanded further. By the way, over the first nine months of 2021, there was growth in real disposable incomes, which we also recorded. Although we understand that, if you look at specific categories, people with low incomes are indeed struggling due to the food inflation, which is higher than the general inflation(around 10 percent). We will adjust our policy accordingly. Once again, by developing the economy and supporting specific categories of people, we expect to increase personal incomes in general. This question is, on the one hand, political and, on the other hand, economic: would it be better to pursue a softer policy? Look, we already said that some countries(I will not specify, as you know them very well) adopted a very soft policy. And what happened? Global inflation growth. Therefore, considering the fundamentals of the Russian economic development(its foundation, its macroeconomic indicators), we will monitor this closely. This is why the Government and the Bank of Russia are taking what I believe to be timely decisions to contain the inflation. At the same time, we are using the reserves to stimulate economic growth– first and foremost, by developing infrastructure in the broadest sense of this word. I am talking about airports, seaports, roads, railways, utility communications, water and energy supplies. We need to create basic conditions for developing the economy and, standing on this foundation, we will be able to move the entire economy forward and improve the quality of life for our citizens. This is the order in which we will continue to take action. I think, it is very important that investors also understand that we will not engage in populism. We will not just print money and inject it into the economy to achieve short-term quick-fix results without thinking about tomorrow. Andrei Kostin: Thank you. Colleagues, let's proceed. Rob Drijkoningen: Good afternoon, Mr President. Rob Drijkoningen, Neuberger Berman. We have several hundred million invested in your country– companies and government bonds. I would like to ask you a question around your direction on going digital. I know Russia is doing a great job of cracking down on cyber hacker groups. But there still seems to be a significant number of attacks that are serious, that are coming out of the Russian territory. What is the main challenge preventing you from putting an end to these? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Dear Rob, what prevents other countries from doing this? There are far fewer cyber attacks from Russian territory than from the territory of other states, for example, the United States. The largest number of cyber attacks reported by international organisations– not Russian, but international agencies, including US ones– came from the US cyberspace. So, what is preventing them from putting an end to this? What is preventing them is that hundreds and thousands of people invent laws, while millions invent ways to evade them. This is also true in this case: considering the speed of global development, the training of professionals and the temptations those with relevant skills and competencies are facing, the state is often lagging behind them. We are taking the necessary measures in this sphere. But to be able to work effectively, just as in the case of the pandemic, we need to unite the efforts of all states. I would like to note that we have urged many of our partners, including our US partners, many times, including during the last year of President Obama's term, to work together on this issue. Initially, the Obama administration seemed to be interested, but later it had no time for these initiatives. Later we made the same offer to President Trump. After my meeting with the incumbent US President in Geneva, we agreed to launch this work; expert groups have already been formed and are working together. I hope that this will have a positive effect not only for the United States and Russia but will also give a positive impetus to global cooperation, primarily on the UN platform. We are resolved to do this, and we will do this. We are interested in this, because the number of cyber attacks against our resources is not decreasing but, on the contrary, has increased. Moreover, the number has increased many times over– I don't remember the exact figure for the first nine months of this year compared to the year before. This is affecting us, and we are aware of the importance of joint efforts in this sphere, and so we will do this. Andrei Kostin: Cyber attacks are one of the reasons why I have been put on the US sanctions list. I have no notion of how to stage such attacks, yet I have been accused of hacking activities. Vladimir Putin: You, a hacker? Really? Andrei Kostin: Yes, this is what the US side thinks. Vladimir Putin: Maybe you are a surreptitious hacker? Andrei Kostin: Yes, I must be a very surreptitious hacker. Vladimir Putin: Maybe we just don't know this.(Laughter.) Andrei Kostin: Yes, I'm a very surreptitious hacker, even if I am not a smartphone user.(Laughter.) All right, colleagues, let's resume our work. Vladimir Putin: We will definitely do this. Andrei Kostin: Who is next? Richard Xu: Hello, Mr President. This is Richard Xu from Cathay Life, and we are active investors in the Russian sovereign banks. And thank you for this rare opportunity. I would like to ask about Russia's fiscal policies, as we are seeing lots of energy exporting countries preparing for the post-oil era. And currently, 30 percent of the federal government's revenue comes from the oil and gas sector. So, what is Russia's long-term fiscal plan? And to navigate this kind of situation? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: This is a traditional question for us. Indeed, oil and gas proceeds account for a considerable volume of our budgetary revenues. But I should note that oil and gas and other energy carrier proceeds continue to dwindle all the time, year after year. At the same time, the share of other, non-oil and gas, proceeds is increasing. And we intend to continue doing this by addressing a key matter of our development, that is, by diversifying the Russian economy. But this is the subject of a separate report and discussion. In any event, we will tread this road. This is the first thing. Second, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the world's population is growing, and that it will continue to grow. Moreover, the economy is growing, and it will continue to grow. The global economy will require more power and energy than it needs today, and it is now hard to predict how the structure of the global energy sector will change. By the way, various specialists voice different approaches and assessments. For example, the International Energy Agency experts believe that, in principle, the structure of the global energy sector will change only slightly, if at all, in the next two or three decades, and that hydrocarbons will remain. First, we are keeping this in mind, but we assume that our hydrocarbon reserves, including oil, first and foremost, can be used not only by the fuel and energy sector, but also by the chemical industry. This, too, will provide us with some revenue. This is the first aspect. Second, an extensive oil and gas infrastructure can be used to produce""green"" hydrogen and supply it to the global market. This hydrogen is slightly more expensive than conventional hydrogen. On the whole, this is possible, and this is a promising direction for the development of our energy sector. And, finally, gas is the most convenient hydrocarbon product, and it is also the cleanest product, so to speak. One can safely say that gas supplies will be retained, and they will expand, especially in Russia, at a time when our main European clients are downsizing production. In 2020, gas production dropped by 24.5 percent there, and their gas demand continues to increase, especially during the transitional period. We are also keeping this in mind. We will develop other energy sources, we will certainly develop alternative energy sources, solar panels and windmills. We are working on this, we are working rather intensively, and the share of these alternative energy sources continues to increase all the time in our energy balance. Today, the Russian energy sector ranks among the""greenest"" in the world. Hydropower plants, nuclear power plants and renewable energy sources account for 40 percent, and their share reaches 86 percent together with gas. Far from all countries achieve such parameters, and they can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Only two, three or four countries are outracing Russia, that is about it, and the rest are posting much lower parameters. And I believe that these are also our initial competitive advantages allowing us to think about the steps that we will have to take in the near future. I am therefore confident that we will have something to work on, including together with our foreign friends and our investors. Andrei Kostin: Thank you. Let us go on please, colleagues. Mehak Bkhatai: Thank you, Mr President. This is Mehak Bkhatai from Wellington Asset Management, based out of Boston. My question is regarding the security situation in the Middle East, especially in light of what happened in Afghanistan this year. I would like to ask you how you see Russia's role in the security situation in the Middle East, and here I ask not just about its political future but also about the economic future. And, related to that, do you see over the next few years that Russia and China can work together in the Middle East towards the economic future of the Middle East? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: First of all, let us discuss the Middle East. The Middle East is a region, with which we traditionally have had very close and very good relations– I mean, with practically all countries in the region. These relations have grown even better, stronger, more pragmatic and effective over the last few decades. I think that this is certainly a success for our foreign policy in this area. What is the key to success all about? It is about respect for the partners, for their traditions, religion and history. It is about absolute non-interference in their internal affairs and a search for points of contact and methods for making these contacts effective. And if they are effective, we get the required result that is of use both to Russia and our partners in the region. Let us recall what was happening a decade ago. The entire""civilised world,"" I think, was applauding the Arab Spring. OK, where is this""spring"" now? Nothing but tragedy came out of it. Why? Because outside forces began exploiting the objective difficulties in some countries to rock the boat and remake the pattern of living there along their own lines. Properly speaking, practically the same, an identical attempt was undertaken in Afghanistan. All of us are well aware of what it all came to. We see, therefore, that on the one hand many of our partners say:""Yes, we made a mistake, it was impermissible to behave like this in Afghanistan,"" but that, on the other, they continue to do the same in other regions. Regrettably, the hard-learned Afghan lesson has taught them almost nothing. I will not give you names now, but I often heard my colleagues say:""Yes, we overdid it there, we failed to take into account this and that."" But the same is continuing in other regions, including, incidentally, in African countries and in the Middle East. I think, therefore, that we should proceed from what I have mentioned– respect for our partners. And if we base our policies– by""we"" I mean the global community as a whole– on these principles, it is certain that success is in store for us. Although occasionally this is a difficult process that requires time and patience, there is no other method to achieve the long-term settlement of one crisis or another and get a head start on development. What I said about the Middle East also concerns Afghanistan. The country is going through difficulties. It is not the right time or place to give opinions about the Taliban and so on, but the Taliban is controlling the situation in Afghanistan right now. We need to help Afghan people, at least by releasing the Afghan funds in the Western bank accounts, primarily in the United States. These funds must be released so that people can have the opportunity to do basic things. This money could be released specifically for humanitarian purposes such as purchasing medical equipment, medications, etc., supporting children– at least for that. It is possible to release the money for a specific purpose. It will not be spent on weapons. The Taliban does not even need more weapons because arms worth billions of dollars were left behind, just abandoned there in Afghanistan. I believe it is necessary to look one step ahead. As for our cooperation with China, we have many areas of cooperation with the People's Republic of China. One of them is, obviously, our cooperation in third countries. This cooperation has been going on for some time and it can be expanded. Why? Because we have similar approaches and principles. We support our Chinese friends in their efforts as part of the Belt and Road strategy. I would like to point out that today, China is the largest investor in the Middle East. Naturally, we welcome these efforts by China as they benefit the region's development. For our part, we will do all we can to ensure security(like we do in Syria, for example) and contribute to maintaining stability in other countries of the region. Of course, we will look for opportunities to use our technology to participate in these countries' economies. Representatives of countries that invest significant resources in the Russian economy are taking part in this meeting. We jointly produce high-tech products here in Russia. These products are exported to third markets, including the investor countries. Our cooperation is expanding and becoming more fruitful. We hope this will be the case for a long time. Andrei Kostin: Colleagues, let's continue. Please. Yekaterina Ilyushenko: Good afternoon. Mr President, VTB Capital, thank you very much for this opportunity to ask a question. In the next decade or two, the Russian economy is going to face certain factors that will slow its potential growth. You have already mentioned some of these factors in your address, such as two demographic waves and, unfortunately, the pandemic that is also having a certain negative effect on the population. Also, there are, unfortunately, slow labour productivity growth, possibly due to the fact that the share of value-added industries in the economy is still small, and the energy transition, the global departure from hydrocarbons. My question is, what do you and other senior officials believe is the most serious obstacle to economic growth? How will it be outlined and in what kind of timeframe? Vladimir Putin: I have already mentioned this and you said it as well. You basically answered your own question. These are demographic issues, labour productivity and diversification of the economy thanks to modern digitalisation trends. I will not go into other areas right now, the areas related to new economies so to speak, involving biology, genetics and so on. But we simply need to put the economy on new modern tracks in the broadest sense of this word. But the demographics, investment and labour productivity that must be based on this new economic structure, on a new quality of economic development– all these things are actually specified in our economic development goals. Of course, everything revolves around people but securing people's interests requires positive resolution of the issues in the areas that I have just mentioned and some of which you have mentioned as well. I think there is no point in listing everything right now as it is set forth in the economic development goals and the strategies for a whole number of areas of focus. For demographics, it is, once again, healthcare, helping families with children and so on. For investment, it is creating conditions for investors, eliminating red tape, creating stable macroeconomic conditions, which we have been able to achieve. As for upgrades and transitioning to modern knowledge-intensive industries, we have also developed strategies to approach this issue and will continue to develop them. Overall, we have managed to achieve a great deal but, of course, there is still a lot to be done. Perhaps even more than has already been done. But the results of the past 10 to 15 years still give me reason to believe that we will continue to develop as fast as we need. At any rate, we really want the Russian economy to grow slightly faster than the average global rate, or 3–3.5 percent. This year, we can achieve 4.7 percent. I do not know if we will manage to maintain this rate in 2022. There are different opinions on this matter but I really hope that it will be higher than the average global rate. I am confident that we are able to achieve that but we will see how it goes. Andrei Kostin: Thank you. Colleagues, next, please. Let us speed it up. Michael Cohen: Michael Cohen, from Capital World Investors. I am based in London. Thank you very much, gentlemen. I wanted to ask: President Biden has recently announced his intention to run for another term. I would like to ask, Mr President, do you intend to do the same? What goals would you like to still achieve for Russia? And what do you think about the next generation of Russian leaders? Vladimir Putin: Have you asked, or was it the translation: which other goals for Russia besides possible re-election? I believe that my re-election is not a goal for Russia. I believe that President Biden did right by announcing his possible re-election, because if he starts preparing for election in the United States, then the governance of the country will be greatly affected. Therefore, the US President does not need my assessments, but I think that he did absolutely right. Speaking about my plans, do you know what the trick is? The trick is that according to the Constitution I have the right to run for another term. I have not decided yet whether I will do this or not. But the very fact that I have this right stabilises the domestic political situation, almost like President Biden's announcement that he will run. The fact that I have this right is enough, for now, but it is too early to say who plans what for 2024. What would I like in the future? Of course, I would like to fulfil the plans we have announced, the goals we have set to develop the country. This also goes for human resources. We have very talented and ambitious young people, and I would like to see ambitious and patriotic young people on the political stage, in the economy, in art who would not be afraid to take the responsibility for the future of Russia and search for ways to develop it and find them, as well as have the strength– creative and physical strength– to fulfil the tasks they set. I do not doubt for a second that this is exactly what Russia's future will be like. Andrei Kostin: Thank you. Colleagues, next, please. Abdulla Al Marzouki(in Russian): Good afternoon, Mr President. My name is Abdulla Al Marzooqi, I am the head of Mubadala office in Moscow. Mr President, the United Arab Emirates and the Russian Federation, through our various sovereign investment funds and financial institutions, have established a strong platform for co-investing. Mr President, you mentioned high-tech products in one of your previous answers. Where else do you see the biggest investment opportunities for our two nations? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: You know that Mubadala fund is a reliable and close partner of ours. I know that you cooperate closely with the Russian Direct Investment Fund. Together you look for opportunities to co-invest and make decisions on automatic co-investment with the RDIF, and there are many areas of co-investment. Of course, we would like to see investments first of all in high-tech spheres of production. I will not list them all now, but I know from Kirill Dmitriev's reports that you are constantly working on this. In fact, he stays in contact with you weekly– with you, with the leadership of the United Arab Emirates. You have already invested 10 billion, if I remember correctly, right? Andrei Kostin: Is the volume of Mubadala's investment in Russia US$10 billion? Vladimir Putin: The platform is worth 10 billion, I believe. Abdulla Al Marzooqi: About 10 billion. Vladimir Putin: Yes. So, first of all, high-tech spheres. However, I know that you are also looking for opportunities in metallurgy, in energy. We have no restrictions on investment from the United Arab Emirates in any economic sector. I know you have good plans for transport. We will support everything you find acceptable and interesting. Andrei Kostin: Thank you. The next question, please. Yerlan Syzdykov: My name is Yerlan Syzdykov. I represent Amundi Asset Management, the world's largest manager of ESG and sustainable development assets and the largest European asset manager. Mr President, in the recent past, Russia has been building stronger ties to China as Western sanctions intensified. As the West designated now, China is a key strategic competitor, and some voices in the West are calling for so-called reverse Nixon policies towards Russia. Will Russia respond and rebalance its relationship with the West and China? And what would be the conditions under which Russia could consider such a rebalancing? And, Mr President, you also mentioned the threats to Russia, Russian security. Given that China is planning to quadruple its nuclear arsenal and recently successfully tested supersonic missiles, at what point will Russia consider the Chinese military buildup as a threat to its national security? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: I have been intimidated by China since 2000. Since that time, those who were intimidating me have got frightened themselves and started changing their China policy. In my opinion, it has already changed– hence, the sanctions and different types of restrictions that seem to me to be unjustified through and through and in conflict– in this case I mean in respect of China– with international law. But it is a fact of life that this rivalry is mounting and, sometimes, I would say, makes little sense, like the creation of an alliance in the Pacific area that comprises the United States, the UK and Australia. Closed alliances established against someone are unlikely to improve the situation in a region– just the opposite, they tend to create tensions. We have always spoken in favour of creating a single security system that considers the interests of all participants in the international dialogue. Well, they did what they did. As for China's growing might, we are seeing it, and everybody is seeing it: it is chiefly economic might. Why then must we be guided by third countries' interests in shaping our policy? We have always been guided, and will be in the future, exclusively by the interests of the people of the Russian Federation– Russia's interests. At the same time, we always have respect for the interests of our partners in the international arena and appreciate reciprocity. Incidentally, China, in response, is treating us the same way. So, as for economic relations, there is an implication in your question: are we not thinking of scaling down cooperation with China, something the United States is urging its European partners to do? Look, last year, in 2020, trade between the US and China grew by 8 percent, while trade between Russia and China by 6.7 percent. Why are they calling on others to curtail relations while they themselves are doing the opposite? First, we will be guided by our interests. Second, we hear the United States call on its European partners to curtail relations with China. But last year, China became the EU's top trading partner, having outstripped the United States. It is a natural process, which cannot be halted. So, one should simply be guided by these considerations and, based on them, shape one's policy. Our trade with China is growing. Last year, it reached US$104 billion. In the near future, in the next couple of years, we plan to bring it to US$200 billion. Generally speaking, that is a good figure for our trade with China but still it is a far cry from what the United States or Europe have with China. With regard to its growing military power, you see, China is a country with a population of almost 1.5 billion people. It is probably entitled to build its defence policy so as to ensure the security of that vast country. Who can say no to it? Economic growth leads to growth of military power. It is a natural process. Look, Great Britain and France have announced their plans to upgrade their nuclear arsenal. Is the United States affected by this? Does this fact concern it? No. Why would we be concerned about the increased military capabilities of our closest neighbour, with which we have an unprecedentedly high level of interstate relations? No, this does not scare us, because we ourselves are building up our capacity as well. You said that China has tested a hypersonic rather than supersonic weapon. They tested hypersonic weapons, and the test was successful, and we saw our US partners' reaction. We are aware that our US partners are a little ahead in creating hypersonic weapons. They just do not talk about it, and no one is making fuss about it. By the same token, no one was making fuss about it when they tested anti-satellite weapons 10 years ago, and now have it in their possession. Russia conducted such a test quite recently, and the entire world was set abuzz. But the United States already has this weapon; it obtained it 10 years ago. So, public rhetoric is one thing, and actual events are another. We will expand our relations with China as we see fit. We are satisfied with the level of our relations. We think that they can be even deeper, more substantive and benefit the people of China and the people of Russia. We are thinking about our own security and are cooperating with our partners in the areas that we consider important. We consider it important to conduct a dialogue on strategic stability with the United States. We are conducting this dialogue with the People's Republic of China as well. We conduct regular joint military exercises, exchange delegations, and we are aware of current developments. Relations are stable, and, moreover, relations between Russia and China are a significant stabilising factor in the world. Andrei Kostin: Mr President, it is rumoured that you will go to Beijing for the Olympic Games. What are you looking forward to more, watching hockey and skiing, or talking with Xi Jinping? Vladimir Putin: I plan to attend the opening ceremony. Andrei Kostin: I see. Very well, colleagues, let's carry on. Who is next? Maria Luisa Matarrelli: Good afternoon, Mr President. My name is Maria Luisa Matarrelli from Eurizon Capital in Milan. We are actively investing in the government bonds market. My question is: you have recently declared that the existing model of capitalism has exhausted itself. Indeed, the issue of income inequality and the need for more social justice together with the de-globalisation of supply chains are becoming more and more important issues in the world after the pandemic especially. How do you see Russia's role in this age of change? Vladimir Putin: We have already touched upon this subject over the course of this discussion, in one way or another. What is the existing model all about? You were right to note that I was talking about the model of capitalism as it exists today. How can it be described? There are a lot of imbalances within it, enabling some countries to benefit from their advances in the defence sector to try and impose their rules of the game, impose sanctions in the economy, which makes it impossible for many countries to unlock their potential. All this throws the global economy off balance and has a disruptive effect on social affairs and politics. All this brings about tension in various parts of the globe and gives rise to acute conflicts, including in the Middle East, which we discussed a short while ago. We know this all too well: this goes for Libya, Yemen, Syria, and Afghanistan. Several African countries face multiple challenges. This is how we get migrant flows. This is what I have been talking about. To avoid all this, we need to build a model of international relations where all members of the international community would feel equal. At the end of the day, we need some sort of common rules, and it is critical that everyone adheres to them. Instead of following someone else's rules when nobody knows who sets them and how, we need common, coordinated rules that are accepted by the international community. This way we would have a sustainable framework. If we can make this happen in trade, this would stop the world's leading economies from imposing their will on weaker economies or dictating trade policies which undermine investment. For example, if we can develop this new kind of relations, which probably can happen only in an ideal world, so this would be a far cry, but still, this would prevent restrictions on settlements in certain currencies. At least if we strive to achieve this, I believe that we can build a more balanced world with a better balance in our relations, which also means a greater effect from the efforts to achieve the goals we pursue. Andrei Kostin: Thank you. Colleagues, next question, please. Chris Kelly: Hello and thank you, Mr President. My name is Chris Kelly. I am a fixed income investor at Invesco in New York, and we invest extensively in Russian government and corporate debt. You argued that US policies undermine the dollar's status of the world's reserve currency, and in line with this, Russia has accelerated its de-dollarisation drive. What do you see as the future of the global monetary system? And what role do you think Russia will play? Also, what are your thoughts on gold and cryptocurrencies as the old and new alternatives to fiat money? Vladimir Putin: I did not say that the dollar is no longer a reserve currency or a universal global currency for carrying out settlements. No. All I said was that the policy carried out by the authorities, and I mean the political authorities of the United States, undermines the dollar and pushes us to look outside of the dollar zone. Chris, do you see what this is all about? It is not that we want to go anywhere else. By the way, Russia's major oil and gas companies transact in dollars. However, to give you an example, we are being prevented from carrying out dollar settlements with our partners in the defence industry. Do we have any choice? We are being forced to look elsewhere. They impose sanctions on certain goods that have nothing to do with the defence sector, which also makes dollar settlements quite challenging. The American authorities are creating problems with their own hands, which squeezes the dollar-denominated transaction volumes around the world. This is happening not only in Russia, but around the world. I think that there was also a slight decline in the share of dollar-denominated foreign exchange reserves from 61 to 59 percent. The pound sterling and the yen have been increasing their share in international forex reserves, while the share of the dollar has been shrinking. If the US government continues down this road, the share of the dollar will decline even further. This would happen all by itself, quite naturally, and not because we want to do something and so on. All the other global economic actors also see what is going on and are beginning to think about this. Therefore, we have been transitioning to settlements in national currencies in our relations with many countries. For example, some international structures like BRICS are creating their own currency baskets. We are also thinking about this within the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation(SCO). Of course, what matters the most here is to make the ruble less volatile. If we think about certain settlements with our partners, at least within the CIS and in our cooperation with the former Soviet republics, where our ruble-denominated settlements are increasing, less volatility is clearly our main objective. This is obvious. This is also why we are trying to maintain macroeconomic stability and macroeconomic indicators, that's why all this is interconnected. On the whole, we have succeeded in this. We are aware of the amount and value of the Russian ruble, yet it is becoming a regional currency, up to a point. As for settlements in the economy, they are increasing and have reached an impressive level in relations with some countries. Regarding gold and digital currencies, some countries use cryptocurrencies, and others have a ban on them. I believe their use is prohibited in China and three or four other countries. They are not backed by anything and are highly volatile, which implies huge risks. Likewise, I believe that we should listen to those who are pointing to these huge risks. On the other and, cryptocurrencies are being increasingly widely used in some countries and economies. Maybe the future belongs to cryptocurrencies, but we should closely monitor the process of their development. Now, about gold. Regrettably, it happened in a natural way: the gold standard has been abandoned, and now a return to the gold equivalent is hardly possible, at least because the volume of global trade is many times larger than the global gold reserves. Therefore, the use of the gold currency or gold-backed money is a complicated process. On the other hand, the volume of precious metals in our reserves remains considerable. In other words, the increasing amount of reserve currencies is now the main trend. I know that Arab countries are considering the possibility of creating their own reserve currency, the euro is developing as a reserve currency, and transition to the use of reserve currencies at some international organisations will take traction. And there are also settlements in national currencies. So, we will continue developing in several directions. But we have not abandoned the dollar; we will continue using it as long as our partners want this. If they do not want this, we will reduce the use of the dollar. Andrei Kostin: I would like to add that we are working with the Central Bank to create an unofficial version of the crypto-ruble, which may have a future. As for Bitcoin, I would like to say a few words about it, if I may. In addition to speculative transactions, Bitcoin is being widely used to finance all manner of black markets and the like. I believe that it is playing a destructive role. And I believe that there is logic in the decision of some countries to prohibit its use. Thank you very much. Colleagues, let's proceed. We do have some time left, don't we? Vladimir Putin: Yes, we do. Andrei Kostin: Please, there is still some time. Dominic Bokor-Ingram: Good afternoon, Mr President. My name is Dominic Bokor-Ingram. I appreciate the opportunity to talk to you on behalf of Fiera Capital, a Canadian-based global asset management company. I have been investing in Russian equities since 1994. I have seen many ups and many downs, and I have seen the impact of government policies, both positive and negative. So my question is, as we move forward, we have seen in recent months the Chinese government has taken major steps resulting in greater oversight and control of many of its digital and online industries. Do you think such developments are appropriate and are they necessary in Russia? Vladimir Putin: China used to have a rather liberal policy towards various digital companies. This was logical, because the process was only beginning, and our Chinese friends created conditions under which it was profitable to enter and work in the Chinese market. Today the significance of these digital platforms has increased dramatically in the economy, as well as at the political and social level, and so China has toughened control of their operation. This is not surprising or unusual. Why? You may see that the same is taking place in Europe. And the United States is discussing this possibility as well. The issue is being discussed throughout the world, and it is only the matter of the level and amount of oversight and control. In general– I will not go into detail now, because you understand me, there must be a balance between the freedom of enterprise, the proliferation of information and the interests of the state and people so as to prevent these digital platforms from any abuses. I can understand the logic of our Chinese partners. As for Russia, we will proceed from the current realities in the country. Yes, we need some forms of oversight and control in Russia, but these measures must not hamper economic activity. Of course, it is very important to consider all matters related to the protection of personal data– this is very important– and the use of depersonalised information. We need to thoroughly analyse the developments abroad and such practices before taking any action. This is exactly what we have been trying to do. Andrei Kostin: Thank you, Mr President. Colleagues, we have very little time left. Please, who will dare? Jeff Grills: Hello, Mr President. Apologies for my technical difficulties. My name is Jeff Grills from Aegon Asset Management. First, I want to say thank you very much for taking the time to answer our questions. You have already commented on Russia's commitment to carbon neutrality by 2060. I wanted to ask if you could comment more specifically on your expectation for the development of new energy resources in Russia, such as hydrogen power. And, additionally, what would be the impact to the corporate market from government regulations going forward to potentially align their goals of reducing their impact on the climate? Thank you very much. Vladimir Putin: I have already mentioned this, including hydrogen, but I will repeat it now. We have hydropower and nuclear power plants, and also renewable sources, which account for 40 percent of our[energy] balance, and the share is 86 percent if we take gas into account. Only three or four, and certainly not more than five countries have this structure. In this sense, our situation is satisfactory. However, we must also think about the future. As for hydrogen power, we are working on it as well. We have some competitive advantages, namely, scientific schools, good know-how and skilled personnel, as well as available infrastructure, for example, gas pipelines, which can be used to pump green hydrogen, and so on. Of course, we will be thinking about this, just as we are developing wind and solar power projects now. Incidentally, we are often doing this in cooperation with our European partners. Of course, we will continue doing this. At the same time, the transition should be gradual, without price surges that we are seeing in global energy right now. Nothing good can come from that. Investment in hydrocarbons is dwindling around the world. What can result from that? A deficit. Because it is very unlikely that we can switch to solar or wind energy overnight. We cannot. Hydrogen energy is not ready either. We even have specific plans with calculations. I will not go into details right now. Based on these figures we know approximately when we can start producing hydrogen and increasing hydrogen production. But that requires time and money. Consumers will also need time to get accustomed to this primary source(and it is a primary source). I have already mentioned that, according to the International Energy Agency, the global energy mix will change in the next two or three decades but not too drastically. The world population is growing as is the economy. You see, developed countries have accumulated a certain volume of emissions. Developing countries did not do that. The emissions were accumulated by industrially developed economies, weren't they? And now the industrially developed economies are starting to dictate new rules to the countries with insufficient level of development– rules that, if followed, will never help them achieve the required level of development and eliminate poverty and migration. Is this what we want? Probably not. Nobody wants that, am I right? Therefore, we must, by all means, work together to search for a compromise and make very fine adjustments so that all countries are satisfied. Is this possible? I think it is because everybody understands the risks of unbalanced development. As concerns hydrogen, we are working and will continue to work on this. Hopefully, together with you. Andrei Kostin: Mr President, we are running out of time. Thank you very much. We have several unanswered questions but, like in the previous years, we will put those who did not get their answers at the beginning of the queue for the next forum. Vladimir Putin: Sounds good. For my part, I would like to thank our organiser and host and to thank all of you, ladies and gentlemen, for participating in this forum, for your interest in working with Russia and for your trust. We will do our best to live up to it. And please do not be angry if you did not get a chance to ask a question. We will make sure you get this chance next time or at another event that many of you are also attending, including the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. I would like to invite you all to this forum. Andrei Kostin: Thank you, Mr President. Colleagues, thank you. Vladimir Putin: Thank you."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67222,Meeting with BTS-MOST Board Chairman Ruslan Baysarov,2021-11-29T13:40:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with BTS-MOST Board Chairman Ruslan Baysarov.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Baysarov, your company has implemented and continues working on rather large, we can even say nationwide projects, such as the Eastern Operating Domain, then the port of Sabetta, which, as far as I know, you have done together with Novatek, is that right? BTS-MOST Board Chairman Ruslan Baysarov: Yes, together. Vladimir Putin: Border checkpoints with the People's Republic of China. Let us discuss all of this. Ruslan Baysarov: Thank you for the meeting, Mr President. I will be brief, if I may. The history of Bamtonnelstroy began with an executive order of the Ministry of Transport Construction in 1975. Everything is here in the book, so I do not miss anything. Let us look through it, and I will comment on it. These are all the projects– well, not all of them, but a part, there are too many and I have just created an excerpt. Vladimir Putin: Fine. Ruslan Baysarov: On the first page, as I have already said, you can see the history of Bamtonnelstroy. I would like you to note, Mr President, that all the ten tunnels, including the one that was the most difficult to build, Severomuysky Tunnel, were built by Bamtonnelstroy workers. First, only eight were planned, but then the Government decided to add another two. Next, there is a description of the tunnels our workers built. Severomuysky Tunnel. There are many of them: over 50 tunnels. This one is the most difficult tunnel in the world. Vladimir Putin: Severomuysky Tunnel? Ruslan Baysarov: Yes, a symbol of the tenacity of the Bamtonnelstroy workers. Foreign experts refused to build it and suggested we refuse too. In 1984, First Deputy Prime Minister Heydar Aliyev, member of the USSR Communist Party Central Committee, travelled to the construction site to support the tunnel builders. As you know, the tunnel was completed, and it remains the most difficult tunnel, a very interesting facility. Vladimir Putin: What was so difficult about it? Ruslan Baysarov: The soil is very heavy there, and there were tectonic collisions, underground currents, gas emissions. This was a very difficult project, but we completed it. Vladimir Putin: 45 kilometres, is that right? Ruslan Baysarov: We have constructed 45 kilometres of tunnels in total there, this one is 15.5 km. At the beginning, the Politburo planned to build eight tunnels there. When Heydar Aliyev arrived, the workers explained that it was necessary to build another two loop tunnels there, and he made the decision on the spot, together with Bamtonnelstroy workers. So, an additional two loop tunnels were built there. Can you imagine? A very difficult and a very interesting tunnel; it still remains one of the most difficult facilities to have been built in the world. Here, on page 19, we see the arrival of the first train from Severobaikalsk. By the way, Severobaikalsk is the only city built from scratch by Komsomol members from Leningrad. It is a beautiful city. We opened a tunnel there. This is how residents of Severomuysk welcomed the tunnellers. And these are our heroes– the tunnel builders.(Commenting on the pictures.) In addition to three labour heroes, we have over 5,400 employees who received state awards for the construction of tunnels. Forty-eight experts were among the emergency responders at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Bamtonnelstroy experience was soon in demand all over the country and we started building the metro. Look at this map, please. It shows facilities at the top. We built over 2,500 unique infrastructure facilities in 46 years. The map shows only the biggest and most important ones– 750 in all. We have also built two facilities in Serbia this year. The bridge to Russky Island is a symbol of our company. You know it well. It is depicted on the 2,000-ruble banknote. Vladimir Putin: Yes, exactly. It turned out to be a beautiful bridge. Ruslan Baysarov: Very beautiful. You know, it has the world's longest cable-stayed bay. This is the construction of the bridge to Russky Island. The Alpika-Servis Ski Resort. You know it well. It was one of the most difficult projects of the Sochi Olympics. This is how Alpika-Servis was built. Vladimir Putin: Nothing was easy there, I know. This was a difficult project. Ruslan Baysarov: It was a very difficult project. You know, there were 23 facilities there, and our engineers did a good job. Vladimir Putin: You even had an international team there, did you not? Ruslan Baysarov: Yes, we did. We invited foreigners. And this is our tunnelling shield. This is our equipment with a 12-metre diameter. You know this as well. The Sabetta seaport is unique in the world in terms of its complexity. This is one of the largest projects. Mr President, the total volume of dredging amounted to 70 million cubic metres. I will mention for the sake of comparison that this is the same as the amount involved in building 70 tunnels with a total length of 490km. Can you imagine this? Vladimir Putin: Yes, it is a difficult job. Ruslam Baysarov: In addition, I would like to say, Mr President, that we released 440 million fingerlings into the Gulf of Ob. The Island of Sakhalin. Please note what we had to face as we undertook construction projects on the island. It was only last year that we managed to implement the long-standing dream of local residents by converting the Japanese narrow-gauge railway over to the Russian 1,520 mm track standard. There are 62 facilities dotting the 454-kilometre-long railway. We had to ferry in whatever was needed from the continent. It was a tough project. You can see the outcome of our work on pages 52 and 53– nice facilities. The people of Sakhalin are grateful to you for your support: at last, they began to travel. The new Baikal tunnel. You are well aware of the parameters of the new Baikal tunnel. I would like to add that we have completed the construction project six months ahead of schedule. Vladimir Putin: This is almost seven kilometers of roads. Ruslan Baysarov: Yes, quite right. Russia's first tunnel of this kind has been built despite the COVID-19 pandemic. A government commission came to check how the work was proceeding. On page 58, please notice the infrastructure we have built to service the new Baikal tunnel. This has made it possible to increase its service life, and, most importantly(you can see a small dot next to it; this is the old Baikal tunnel), there was no infrastructure around the old Baikal tunnel. Vladimir Putin: This is a current project, isn't it? Ruslan Baysarov: Yes, this is the bridge across the Zeya River. Pursuant to your instructions, we have started to build a 9-kilometre-long bridge in Blagoveshchensk, with approach roads. It is a very good and interesting project, as you may know. You have instructed us to do it. Last year, we completed the construction of a railway bridge across the Don River… Vladimir Putin: Excuse me, what is the deadline for the Zeya bridge? Ruslan Baysarov: Across the Zeya– 2023. Vladimir Putin: Quite soon. Ruslan Baysarov: Yes, we are maintaining high construction rates. We will show this to you a bit later. The next project is also an important one. Vladimir Putin: Blagoveshchensk-Heihe. Ruslan Baysarov: Yes, Blagoveshchensk-Heihe, the first cross-border motorway bridge linking Russia and China built without federal budget allocations. Its opening has been delayed on account of the COVID-19 pandemic. We would like to ask you to invite President of China Xi Jinping to the ceremony, because this is a very great and important event– the first bridge. Let us move on. This is the first railway bridge crossing between the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China, which was another major and complex project. We had to use non-conventional solutions during the construction. At a certain point, the ice was up to three metres thick before it started drifting. We had to use out-of-the-box solutions in order to save the trestlework. We cut the sheet piles under ice. Vladimir Putin: Under ice? Ruslan Baysarov: Can you believe it? Vladimir Putin: No, I cannot. Ruslan Baysarov: Our specialists cut the sheet piles. We built a bathhouse on the bank(this is true, no exaggeration), cooked hot food and offered them beverages. People went three metres under the ice. The current was strong, but they cut sheet piles, pipes 1.3 metres in diameter, to be exact. There were cranes up above, which held these pipes to prevent them from falling. Our specialists cut the sheet piling, let the ice go, and then built up the sheet pile, pumped out the water, and went on with the construction. Had we not done this; the ice could have destroyed the trestlework and the bridge from the Chinese side which would have been a major emergency situation. Mr Trutnev[Deputy Prime Minister– Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoy to the Far Eastern Federal District] is in charge of the project. He often visits the project and monitors the progress. This is the old Zeya Bridge built in 1982. It is the only bridge that connects the city with the left bank. You held a videoconference on an emergency as well. We saved the city, using several technical windows during the night and repaired the bridge. This is the Zeya Bridge, which you asked us to build. Deputy prime ministers visit Zeya Bridge to check how the construction is proceeding. Mr President, this is the metro. Last year, we made it to the Guinness Book of Records with 23 tunnelling machines operating simultaneously to construct the metro in Moscow. Vladimir Putin: This is a huge amount of work. Ruslan Baysarov: Yes, this is a massive effort. Mr President, this page shows an 11-metre tunnel boring machine. We transported it, already assembled– we were the first in Russia to do so– and then we lowered it– over 800 tonnes– into the head part of the foundation pit in the station under construction. This shows an overpass built 30 years ago which collapsed due to an excessive load on the Trans-Siberian Railway. The technologies were different back then. We will soon complete the construction of a new overpass. We are now starting to build the Dusse-Alin tunnel. After the Baikal tunnel, our entire team moved there. Vladimir Putin: To Khabarovsk? Ruslan Baysarov: Yes, to Khabarovsk Territory. There is not a living soul 940 kilometres away from Khabarovsk. It is a difficult project, but we are already getting down to work. Vladimir Putin: It is a big one. Is it about two kilometres? Ruslan Baysarov: Yes. It is complicated and difficult, plus the climate conditions on top of all that. As part of the M-12 project, we started building two bridges across the Oka and the Sura rivers. In Kaliningrad, we began building two bridges– one for trains and one for cars. Vladimir Putin: Across the Pregolya River? Ruslan Baysarov: Yes. Germans built the previous bridge, and it has gone down in history as a museum show piece. These are the new bridges. We are starting to build them this year. They lift up. Vladimir Putin: They are also beautiful and look unusual. Why are they so high? What for? Ruslan Baysarov: We repeated what the Germans did in 1922, but ours is a modern bridge. They raised the previous bridge manually, and we do this automatically. Vladimir Putin: Why are the supports so high? Ruslan Baysarov: The bridge is raised. Vladimir Putin: The bridge is raised? Ruslan Baysarov: Yes, it is raised to let ships pass. Vladimir Putin: So it will be raised on all supports? Ruslan Baysarov: Yes, it is raised, lets ships pass and then goes down again. In Leningrad, bridges open up, and here it goes up. This is easier to do. Vladimir Putin: This is interesting. Ruslan Baysarov: A large project. And this is the railway bridge. Vladimir Putin: Nearby? Ruslan Baysarov: They are close to each other, and the old bridge is also nearby. And this is an ambitious transport project in the entire Balkans region. We are completing a project in Serbia. President Vucic often visits us and thanks you for your support. The supports are as high as an eight-storey building. Vladimir Putin: Yes, this is impressive. Well done. Ruslan Baysarov: Mr President, returning to the Baikal tunnel, I would like to ask you a favour. Our people worked in difficult climatic conditions, and I would like to ask you to award the most distinguished specialists, as you suggested. Vladimir Putin: I would be glad to do so. Please convey my gratitude to them. Ruslan Baysarov: Many thanks. I certainly will. <…>"

New energy units, based on a Russian design, are currently under construction at two Chinese nuclear power plants. The Russian-Chinese Energy Business Forum is an effective mechanism for a direct dialogue between Russian and Chinese fuel and energy companies. This year's agenda is quite intensive, as usual. It is important that the programme includes such topical issues as development and implementation of energy-efficient technology and green energy development. Information and analysis platforms are another area of cooperation that is in great demand. One such platform is the Investment Atlas of Russian-Chinese Energy Cooperation. I hope that the discussions during the forum will be constructive and substantial and will outline new promising forms of cooperation for the benefit of our nations."""

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67209,Address on KVN 60th anniversary,2021-11-27T21:30:00Z,NA,,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, I sincerely congratulate you on this remarkable date, the 60th anniversary of the creation of the Club of the Funny and Inventive, KVN. The first KVN TV show was aired in November 1961 and immediately became so popular that millions of people rushed to their TV sets at the first sounds of the title sequence. Far from every flat had a TV set back then, so oftentimes all the neighbours got together in front of a single TV to watch it. KVN dazzled and won people's hearts with its vibrant and unique format, its abundance of humour, energy and flare. Very soon it grew from simply a TV show into a real youth movement. KVN used to be played and is still being played in schools and universities, big cities and small settlements. Its popularity has long since extended beyond the borders of our country and, without exaggeration, has taken on an international flavour. Throughout the decades KVN has become, in essence, a part of our lives, a uniting and bonding link both inside the country and abroad, especially where they know and love the Russian language. Jokes aside, KVN is rooted not just in humour but also in much deeper things, such as the values of teamwork, fair and open competition, mutual respect and mutual support. Affection for KVN unites entire generations of spectators and, surely, its participants. People of different ages and professions, both physicists and lyricists alike, so to speak, take pride in belonging to the KVN community. For many young people and students KVN has become a springboard for their future TV, performing and creative careers. Regardless of its rather mature age, KVN remains young, dynamic and daring. And credit for this mostly rests with Alexander Maslyakov. I would like to thank Alexander Maslyakov once again from the bottom of my heart and congratulate him on this anniversary, and it is my hope that the Club of the Funny and Inventive will always maintain at the highest level its powerful wave of humour, wit and fighting spirit. Congratulation on this holiday– KVN's anniversary!"

I ask the Government of the Russian Federation and the regional authorities to do everything to support the injured and the victims' families. The Prosecutor General's Office and the Investigative Committee have also been instructed to determine the causes of the tragedy. Whenever such tragic events occur, we immediately start investigating what had caused them. We must make sure that nothing like this happens in the future, and to achieve that we need system-wide efforts and control over the execution of previous decisions. We will speak about that separately and in detail. Meanwhile, let us return to the topic we have gathered to discuss. I will brief you on the outcome of my talks with President of Azerbaijan and Prime Minister of Armenia on the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement and on the agreements we reached during our meeting today.

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67204,Meeting with Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan,2021-11-26T21:00:00Z,Sochi,Vladimir Putin had a meeting with Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, I would like to thank you again for being here in Russia today. As we said after our trilateral meeting, and I think you will agree with it, the meeting was instrumental and timely in view of the previous and current developments. We have gathered here to thwart any tragic events on the border and in general between the two countries and peoples, so as to move forward, as we said. All the region's nations– Russia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, are interested in that. Let us hope that the agreements we reached today will bring positive results as soon as possible. Regarding our bilateral relations, we said repeatedly, and I want to stress it again, that relations between Russia and Armenia are of a strategic and allied nature rooted deep in history. We value that very much and we will continue maintaining this level of contacts in every possible way. Economically, Russia is Armenia's biggest trade and economic partner and the biggest investor in the Armenian economy. True, last year the turnover slumped somewhat. However, this year it is progressing rapidly, I would say, and I hope that we will reach the pre-pandemic level and move beyond it. I am confident that now, after the trilateral format(you know and we agreed about the schedule that I meet with President of Azerbaijan prior to the trilateral meeting) during our bilateral meeting we have a chance to discuss the entire range of our bilateral ties. Please. Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan Pashinyan NikolPrime Minister of the Republic of Armenia: Thank you, Mr President. I want to thank you once again for the invitation and the organisation of today's meetings. Obviously, our bilateral relations are very important. You have already stressed that Russia and Armenia have strategic and allied relations. We have a very packed agenda practically in all areas. We are cooperating, and we have an agenda within CSTO, CIS, the Eurasian Economic Union. However, I have to acknowledge that during our recent meetings we have discussed mostly the regional agenda because it has many interdependent issues. I want to highlight again the role you played in stopping the 44-day war and deploying Russian peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh. Stabilising factors are crucial in our region. You have underscored a number of times today the importance of settling the Nagorno-Karabakh problem. This issue is invariably discussed at our bilateral meetings as well. Since we have already covered regional issues, I want to note that that despite economic and other difficulties, Russian investments in the Republic of Armenia seem to be on the rise this year. This is very important for us because I think it is a sign for investors that the Republic of Armenia is a very reliable country, and this matters a lot of us. Of course, COVID-related economic problems, regretfully, persist but we recently noticed with satisfaction the stepping-up of the turnover within the Eurasian Economic Union. This is very important, too. I hope we will be able to ultimately arrive at the solution on opening all economic and transport communications in our region, which will do a great deal to energise trade and economic relations within the EAEU and Armenian-Russian bilateral ties. Thank you once again. Vladimir Putin: I completely agree with you. These communications, transport routes we spoke about in the trilateral format today, are crucial for all the countries in the region, including Russia, because we are interested in these transport routes with our strategic partner Armenia being reliable, diversified and readily available all year round, which is key. I hope we will move onto the final stages of this work. There are some points I saw today that require additional coordination but they are not of fundamental nature, which also became obvious during our discussions today. As for purely economic and pragmatic issues, I can say that everything has been basically agreed on, so I have no doubt that the progress will be noticeable and positive very soon. And you are absolutely right and I agree with you, we spoke about this during the trilateral discussion: as soon as people see how everything has begun working, the region will have a different atmosphere, there is no doubt about that. Therefore, I want to thank you for today's constructive conversation. Meanwhile, we also have an opportunity to speak about bilateral issues. We maintain regular contacts, we often meet and speak regularly over the phone. But today we have a chance to speak in person, so let us seize this opportunity. Thank you very much. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67203,"Statements by leaders of Russia, Azerbaijan and Armenia following trilateral talks",2021-11-26T20:00:00Z,Sochi,,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, To conclude our trilateral meeting, I would like to thank again my colleagues, the President of Azerbaijan and the Prime Minister of Armenia, for agreeing to come to Russia today and to discuss the situation taking shape in the region in general and as regards the settlement of the Karabakh problem. I should say from the start that our talks today were very constructive. It was an in-depth analysis of the current situation. We gave credit to the efforts of the Russian peacekeepers, border guards and those specialists who conduct mine clearing and ensure people's return to their homes. I also want to stress that we agreed on a number of issues which I consider vital. The first of them is the establishment of mechanisms for border demarcation and delimitation between the two states, and we agreed to complete this work by the end of the year. I hope it will happen as soon as possible. There are no obstacles to establishing such mechanisms. Second, I would like to mention a very important and sensitive point related to humanitarian issues, and we have also made good progress here. Finally, we held an in-depth discussion on economic issues, on developing economic ties, and spoke about unblocking transport corridors as the first step. This concerns both railway and road traffic. I think we ought to thank our deputy prime ministers who have been working on this issue for a long time, and we agreed that next week they will meet in Moscow to sum up some of the results and announce the decisions we approved today. Thank you very much once again for today's work. I want to thank both the President of Azerbaijan and the Prime Minister of Armenia. President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev Aliyev IlhamPresident of Azerbaijan: Thank you very much, Mr President. To begin with, let me once again express my gratitude for today's meeting as well as for your efforts to create a favourable atmosphere in resolving issues between Azerbaijan and Armenia. A year has passed since the trilateral Statement put an end to the war between the two countries, and we generally view this year as a positive one. I would like to use this opportunity to thank you again, Mr President, and the Russian Defence Ministry for the peacekeeping efforts in Karabakh. There have been no serious incidents in the zone of responsibility of the Russian peacekeeping forces. There have been many important events during this year. This is our second meeting in this format; the first one was held at the beginning of the year and this one is to finish the year. I do not want to repeat what the President of Russia said about delimitation, demarcation and unblocking of transport arteries. Today we have had a very detailed and I would say sincere talk on all these issues. We openly discussed our plans that cause concern of both parties, and I think the key is that the decisions we made regarding settling arguments and disputes will contribute to making the situation in the South Caucasus safer and more predictable. Also, as the President of Russia noted, humanitarian issues were discussed. Azerbaijan always consistently advocated the observance of all humanitarian norms, be it during hostilities or afterwards. I must say that after the hostilities ended, over 100 Armenian servicemen were returned to Armenia, including one today who had been wounded and was treated by Azerbaijani doctors, as well as a civilian who got lost on our territory. It means we have always proceeded from the primacy of the principle of humanism and we are set to proceed in that direction. We see the same commitment from the Armenian side to build conditions for the situation in the region to be more predictable. I repeatedly said that we in Azerbaijan are ready to turn the page after many years of confrontation with Armenia and start the stage of normal interaction. I think in this format we are approaching our goals. Russia is a friend and strategic partner for Azerbaijan, I would even say, more than a strategic partner, and the level of trust-based relations between Azerbaijan and Russia also contributed to finding a solution to the most sensitive issues with Armenia. I think our meeting will yield good results, which will be visible very soon and the situation in the region will become safer and more predictable. Mr President, thank you again for the invitation and for today's meeting. Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan Pashinyan NikolPrime Minister of the Republic of Armenia: Mr President, allow me to thank you again for the invitation and, of course, for creating a positive working atmosphere. I want to stress that we had a very positive meeting, a positive conversation. We discussed practically all the issues on the agenda. It was not a meeting meant to conceal problems. It was a meeting where we openly discussed all issues. I want to note that it is very positive that we clarified our positions and it turned out that we do not have disagreements on some issues which seemed to exist prior to the meeting. I want to say that indeed, regarding reopening of all transport and economic routes in the region we stated that we have a common understanding of how the routes will operate. The topic of delimitation, demarcation and the start of this process is not new, and we discussed it as well. We also adopted a trilateral Statement, which says that conditions need to be established for that, which means some sort of security and stability mechanisms on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan must be created. Obviously, humanitarian issues were also discussed. I generally hold a very positive view of today's talks and today's meeting. I want to thank our strategic ally, the Russian Federation, for the initiative. I think that if our talks gain momentum based on this meeting, we can expect real results. I reaffirm the readiness of Armenia and the Government of Armenia, which got its mandate from the people of Armenia, to usher in the era of peaceful development for our country and for our region. We are committed to that and today's meeting clearly contributed to the implementation of this agenda. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: To conclude, I want to stress again that the meeting was highly useful and timely. As has been said, we signed a Statement on the results of our today's work. The public and the media can read that statement. It gives a more detailed account of what we worked on and what we agreed on. You can see to my left our present to both our Armenian and Azerbaijani friends: an olive branch, a symbol of peace and wellbeing. I sincerely hope that today's agreements will be followed on and will create conditions for further steps in normalising relation in the entire South Caucasus."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67200,Meeting with Ilham Aliyev and Nikol Pashinyan,2021-11-26T19:20:00Z,Sochi,"At the initiative of Vladimir Putin, trilateral talks were held in Sochi between the President of the Russian Federation, President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev and Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan.","The consultations were timed to coincide with the anniversary of the signing of the Statement on a complete ceasefire and termination of all hostilities in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict zone of November 9, 2020. The discussion focused on the progress in implementing the earlier agreements, further steps towards strengthening stability and restoring peaceful life in the region, and various aspects of restoring and developing trade, economic and transport links. Following the meeting, Vladimir Putin, Ilham Aliyev and Nikol Pashinyan approved a Statement by the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia and the President of the Russian Federation. The leaders of the three countries also made statements on the outcome of the trilateral talks. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends, I would like to begin by thanking you for making time to respond to my invitation and to come to Russia to review the work that has been carried out during the year since the adoption of the peace statement last year. We reaffirmed our agreements on the ceasefire and restoring normal life later in January. A lot has been accomplished during this time. Unfortunately, not every issue have been settled yet. I am aware of the tragic incidents at the border when people on both sides get killed or wounded. These things require special attention on our part, and in fact, we are meeting today in order to avoid incidents like this in the future. Overall, much has been accomplished during the year. First, no large-scale hostilities are taking place, which is very good in and of itself. During this time – and with our assistance – much has been done to have the refugees go back to their homes, with 53,000 people returning to their permanent place of residence. A good monitoring group has been created, and our contingent is working there. As far as I understand and according to assessments from both sides, it is doing a good job, providing safe living conditions for the locals. The Russian-Turkish ceasefire monitoring centre is operational. Most importantly, conditions are being created for a normal peaceful life. A trilateral commission has been created at the level of deputy prime ministers of the governments of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia. My colleagues have reported to me on its progress. It is not easy, but, nevertheless, this work is at an advanced stage, and there is reason to believe that we will soon be able to not only confirm the work of the corresponding group on unblocking transport links, but also make the appropriate decisions that everyone needs. I think this is, in fact, the goal of our efforts, namely, to create proper conditions for the revival of the region so people can feel safe and engage in economic activity and develop the economy. All this, of course, should have the most favourable effect on the living standards of the citizens of both countries. This is of great importance for Russia since we have special relations with Armenia and Azerbaijan. We were part of a single state for many centuries, we have deep historical ties, and I would not want to sever them, but on the contrary, we must strive to restore and maintain them in the future. This is what I would like to say in my opening remarks. President Aliyev and I have preliminarily discussed the issues that we will be working to approve in the course of our joint work. We have done this with the Armenian side in advance. I have repeatedly discussed these matters with the Prime Minister of Armenia, and we also exchanged views on this matter on our way to this venue. Mr Pashinyan will stay after the trilateral meeting, and we will have a bilateral meeting with him. This is, perhaps, all I wanted to say to open our meeting. If our colleagues want or need to say something at the beginning of our meeting, please go ahead. President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev: Thank you very much for the invitation, Mr President. We in Azerbaijan greatly appreciate your personal participation in settling relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and of course, your involvement in harmonizing the text of the Statement last year. As you mentioned, we met in this format early this year. Now we are meeting at the end of the year so we can review the results. Of course, the situation is generally stable in the zone of responsibility of the Russian peacekeepers. There have been no serious incidents or deliberate provocations. Isolated incidents were not common. So I would like to thank the Russian peacekeeping contingent for its good service: they are ensuring security in the region that was in a state of frozen conflict for many years and the site of a full-scale war last year. This year, Azerbaijan has displayed a most constructive approach towards eliminating the consequences of the war and unblocking communications. I believe this issue is an important one as one of the items that have not yet been fulfilled, because the other items in the trilateral Statement, which was adopted and signed in November last year, have mostly been carried out. So I think, as we have already talked about this, it would be natural to discuss this, as well as the delimitation of borders between Azerbaijan and Armenia. We also appreciate Russia's support, including advice, on this issue. The border between Azerbaijan and Armenia has not been delimited, and we have repeatedly said on the record that we are willing to start the process of delimitation immediately. Further: we have suggested to Armenia, publicly, starting work on a peace treaty in order to put an official end to the confrontation, recognize each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty and live in the future as neighbours, learn to live as neighbours from scratch. Of course, there is a host of other emerging problems, but they are being resolved promptly, in part with Russia's help – your personal involvement and contributions from the Foreign Ministry, the Defence Ministry, the Government and other bodies. I would like to thank you again for the opportunity to hold this meeting today. Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan: Mr President, let me first thank you for the invitation and for organising this meeting. But before moving on to today's agenda, allow me to convey condolences on behalf of the Armenian people and from myself over the explosion in Kuzbass. It killed many people. I want to express my condolences to the families and friends of the miners that were killed. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Nikol Pashinyan: Your personal role and the role of the Russian Federation in stopping the war last year is obvious to everyone. After November 9, Russian peacekeepers were deployed in Nagorno-Karabakh, along the Lachin corridor. Russian peacekeepers and the Russian Federation are playing a key role in stabilising the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh and the region in general. However, I would like to emphasise that unfortunately the situation is not as stable as we would like it to be. Several dozen people have died on both sides since November 9, and other incidents occur in Nagorno-Karabakh as well. Since May 12 we have actually had a crisis at the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. We believe Azerbaijani troops have invaded Armenia's sovereign territory. Of course, some borders between Armenia and Azerbaijan have not been delimited or demarcated, but a state border exists and this defines the sovereign territory of the Republic of Armenia. I cannot agree with the opinion of the President of Azerbaijan that all items except the unblocking of connections have been fulfilled. You know, and I have discussed this with you several times both in person and by telephone, that there is also the problem of hostages, other detainees and POWs, and this is a very important humanitarian issue. But I would like to say I believe that today we have met not only to voice these problems but also to discuss ways of resolving them. I have also said more than once that Armenia is willing to start the process of delimitation and demarcation of the border. It is vital to us too to open, to unblock all transport and economic connections. We are sincerely interested in resolving these problems, and I hope we will review all of them today. I saw that during your bilateral meeting with the President of Azerbaijan you talked about the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement problem. The President of Azerbaijan just mentioned the issue of peace talks between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Of course, we are also interested in this, and we believe the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement must be co-chaired by the OSCE Minsk Group. I think we must and can discuss many issues in the bilateral format. I must say that officials from Azerbaijan and Armenia are already planning direct contacts. I think it is necessary to emphasise that these positions deserve special mention against the backdrop of the not-so-positive nuances. The most important point about the current meeting is not simply to speak about whether certain problems exist. The main thing is that today we have managed to arrive at practical decisions (or as practical as we could make them) on stabilising the situation in the South Caucasus because we are responsible for peace, stability and security of people. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: I think what you have just said is very important. I am referring to what the President of Azerbaijan and the Prime Minister of Armenia have said. Both sides are interested in normalising the situation and seeing it develop in a positive way. (Addressing Nikol Pashinyan.) You have just mentioned the connections, the need to unblock them. President Aliyev has spoken about this as well. Everyone is interested in this, including Russia, considering that we are all close countries, we are neighbours with large trade. Everyone is obviously interested in doing this. This is the first point. The second point. We are still going to agree on the start of work to demarcate and delimit the borders: first, on delimitation and then on demarcation. We will of course speak about this today. That said, it is clear this is a difficult problem. We inherited it from the Soviet Union. There was no clear-cut border there. But we have an opportunity to talk about all this. I agree with both my colleagues that the more contacts, including direct ones, the better. Direct bilateral contacts are altogether a priority. I know you are going to have another meeting in Brussels soon. You have agreed to go and meet there, and we welcome this as well. The more opportunities you have for direct communication, the better. I also talked about this recently with President of the European Council Charles Michel. He is looking forward to meeting with you. However, I hope we will take a step forward now, and it will be possible to take more steps at other venues. Let me repeat that we do welcome the involvement of our partners in this dialogue. The main point is to make it useful. Thank you very much. <…>"

It is largely thanks to the concerted efforts of your large and tight-knit team, consistent introduction of advanced technologies and effective managerial decision that you have managed in the past years to achieve crucial success in oil extraction, processing and sale, to greatly contribute to the development of Russian regions, enhancing the country's economic, industrial and defence capabilities, and to translate into reality much needed projects in charity, culture, education and sport. Today, environmental issues and mitigating the negative impact of economic activities on the environment have a special place on the national agenda. I hope LUKOIL will pay careful and priority attention to environmental protection issues and become an example of caring and thoughtful attitude towards Russia's natural wealth."""
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67199,Meeting with President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev,2021-11-26T16:00:00Z,Sochi,Vladimir Putin and President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev had a conversation at the Bocharov Ruchei residence in Sochi.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr President. Thank you for coming– many questions have piled up. Of course, we will focus on our trilateral meeting on settling the Nagorno-Karabakh problem. I have just spoken with my colleagues– with the Deputy Prime Minister, you know him well. He deals with resolving economic issues and unblocking transport corridors. I have also spoken with the Defence Minister and with the FSB Director who is in charge of the Border Guard Service that is making a tangible contribution to settling the problem. In short, there are many issues to resolve. However, I would still like to start our bilateral meeting by saying that next year we will mark the 30th anniversary of our diplomatic relations. This is certainly a landmark and I suppose we should celebrate it befittingly. I would like to say in this context that our strategic partnership is making steady headway. It is enough to say that despite all the problems with the pandemic and the related economic restrictions, our trade in the first nine months of this year has still increased by 11 percent– this is a good figure. There are 900 Russian companies operating in Azerbaijan and US$4.5 billion worth of direct Russian investment in its economy. Russia is one of Azerbaijan's leading trade and economic partners. Naturally, we continue our humanitarian contacts against this backdrop and first, as I always say at our meetings, I would like to thank you for the attention you attach to the development of the Russian language. There are 304 schools, or maybe even more– about 340 that teach Russian. At any rate, 34 percent of schoolchildren in Azerbaijan either receive instruction in Russian or study the Russian language. This is a good figure that points to the striving of the Azerbaijani leaders to maintain close and diverse contacts with Russia. They are indeed diverse– we are developing both humanitarian relations and youth exchanges. We support many events at the universal human level– all this is creating a good atmosphere for developing relations in the future. With regard to the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement, we will continue this discussion in a trilateral format after the Prime Minister of Armenia joins us. I think our peacekeepers play a positive role there, and the Russian-Turkish centre for monitoring the ceasefire is fully operational as well. Unfortunately, there are problems, incidents and casualties. But this is precisely why we have gathered– in order to see what has been accomplished and what needs to be done by everyone to make sure that nothing of the kind ever happens again and to create proper conditions for calming the situation in the region so that people live in peace and countries continue to move forward. I am delighted to see you. Welcome! President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev Aliyev IlhamPresident of Azerbaijan: Thank you very much, Mr President. First of all, thank you for inviting me. I am glad to have the opportunity to meet with you again. During this year, we maintained a steady dialogue, met and often called each other on the telephone. Our bilateral relations are very satisfying. But first, I would like to personally express my condolences to you in connection with the tragedy that occurred at a mine in the Kemerovo Region. Unfortunately, many people died. I sent a message yesterday, but today I would like to express condolences from the Azerbaijani people to you and all Russian people. We have resolved many issues in a bilateral format, and we are calling our relations a strategic partnership. This is not just a phrase. It is a fact, and we are committed to further raising the level of our relations across all areas. As you noted, trade is on the rise. Mutual interest in economic cooperation, including on the part of the business communities, is vast. Of course, we are very pleased with the fact that our relations cover many areas. We are now implementing seven roadmaps on the most economic spheres, transport, and humanitarian cooperation. Thank you for your assessment of our efforts to promote and preserve the Russian language in Azerbaijan, including through tuition processes. I would also like to thank you for creating conditions for Azerbaijani students to study in Russia. I looked up the latest data before this visit: over 15,000 Azerbaijanis, citizens of Azerbaijan, are studying at Russian universities, or as many as the number of students at a university. They are receiving a very good education and will automatically become a bridge connecting our countries. This week illustrated the development of our relations. This week I met with the Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation. Vladimir Putin: Mr Overchuk. Ilham Aliyev: Yes. Yesterday evening I met with the President of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Your Special Representative for International Cultural Cooperation was in Baku during the past week on an extremely important mission: to develop contacts between the intellectuals and cultural figures of Azerbaijan and Armenia, with Russia's active involvement. Another event this week was a large business conference of the Russian Export Centre and the Eximbank of Russia, in which over 30 Russian companies took part. In other words, this week provided a good example of our relationship in only some of the areas of our cooperation. Of course, this evening we will have a detailed discussion on Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. I would like to point out that during the past year, since the deployment of the Russian peacekeeping forces[in Nagorno-Karabakh] on November 10, 2020, no serious incidents, no armed clashes or any other serious incidents took place in their zone of responsibility. There were sporadic incidents, but they did not amount to a systemwide crisis. There were clashes on the Azerbaijan-Armenia border, but it is not a zone of responsibility of the Russian peacekeepers. Nevertheless, this makes us take a closer look at the developments. We need to talk, including in the trilateral format, about controlling and minimising risks and coordinating a comprehensive settlement of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. We appreciate the role you are playing personally in this matter, the role of the senior officials of the Russian Government and, of course, the role of the Russian peacekeeping forces in maintaining peace in Karabakh. We hope that these efforts will continue next year and that they will produce equally good results. Therefore, I would like to thank you once again for this invitation. I would also like to say once again that I admire the breath-taking nature of this region. I believe that it is a real gem not only of Russia but of the world as a whole. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much. <…>"

Using telecommunication technologies, over a thousand events were held, such as conferences, forums, seminars, and exhibitions. Joint research and educational programmes were developed; agreements were signed to create laboratories that will conduct research in mathematics, chemistry, oceanology, and innovative materials. Among the landmark events were the agreement on China's participation in the megascience project NIKA and the opening of the Russia-China Mathematics Centre by Moscow State University and Peking University.

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67194,Talks with President of Serbia Aleksandar Vucic,2021-11-25T15:10:00Z,Sochi,"Vladimir Putin held talks in Sochi with President of the Republic of Serbia Aleksandar Vucic, who arrived in Russia on a working visit.","Beginning of Russian-Serbian talks President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I am very happy to see you. We have not seen each other for a long time– we met in Moscow in June, I believe, of 2020. A lot of issues have piled up, but despite the problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic, our relations have not only been maintained at all levels but have developed across the board. Of course, this primarily concerns the economy. While our trade declined by 17-odd percent in 2020, a pandemic year, this year it has grown by over 20 percent during the first nine months alone. This means that we will not only overcome the 2020 recession but will also increase the volume of trade. Relations between our governments are developing as well, and we expect the Prime Minister of Serbia to visit Moscow in December. The Intergovernmental Commission is working regularly and I receive reports on its performance. Relations continue in the humanitarian sphere. Serbian students are enrolled in various Russian universities, specialising in various disciplines. We are grateful to you for supporting the Russian language at Serbian schools. Generally, the developments in this sphere are quite positive. I know that you are particularly concerned over certain issues. This is related to the upcoming expiry of Serbia's natural gas delivery contract. I think that we will come to an agreement on that. We will instruct our relevant companies to finalise this work; at any rate, we will find a solution that will undoubtedly be acceptable to our Serbian friends. Soon– next spring, in April– you will have elections. I would like to thank you for your attention, the personal attention that you pay to the development of Russian-Serbian relations. I hope that Serbian voters will also appreciate this. I wish you success at these elections. President of the Republic of Serbia Aleksandar Vucic Vucic AleksandarPresident of the Republic of Serbia: Thank you, Mr President, my dear friend. I am very happy to see you. Despite, as you have said, the coronavirus pandemic, you have found the time for our meeting, and this is a very important, the most important meeting for me. I believe relations between Serbia and Russia are now at the highest level in history and are moving forward in all areas. As you know, we are strategic partners and Serbia considers this its privilege. I would like to convey many thanks to you for your support of our country, its territorial integrity and sovereignty. As you already know, we are seeing a growth of provocations and tension in the region, especially in Kosovo and Metohija. I would like to thank you again for your support at international organisations as well. Of course, we have done a great deal together. We are still looking forward to seeing you in the Temple of Saint Sava in Belgrade, which we built together. And, of course, I would like to thank you very much for gas deliveries. You have already noted that this is a vital issue for us. We built this pipeline together from the Bulgarian border to the border with Hungary. Thank you very much again for your attention and your work, your help in Serbia's development. I wish you and your people all the best. In conclusion, I would like to express my condolences to you in connection with the tragedy in Kuzbass. I sympathise with you and the families of the victims. I wish you and Russia all the best. I would like to repeat that I think our relations are the best in history. This is a fact. Thank you once again for the warm reception and your hospitality. Vladimir Putin: I would like to thank you for your condolences over the tragedy in Kuzbass. It really is a great tragedy, people have died. To be honest with you, I have done more than issue the necessary instructions to the agencies that deal with saving people and helping those injured and the victims' families. My thoughts are with them. I have spoken several times with Kemerovo Region Governor[Sergei Tsivilyov] and the heads of rescue services. They are doing everything in their power but, unfortunately, the situation is not improving, and they are now risking their own lives. The necessary decisions are being taken on the spot. We hope that as many lives as possible will be saved. When people pass away, it is always a major tragedy for their families and dear ones. Let us wait until the end of the rescue operation. As for our relations, I would like to point out one thing. We have mentioned the coronavirus twice, but I am pleased to say that we have not simply delivered Sputnik V to Serbia but also launched its production in Belgrade, which is extremely important for Serbia and the neighbouring countries, where you can send the vaccine that has been produced at your enterprise. So, it is a very positive element of our cooperation, which points to mutual trust and profound cooperation between us. I have not yet mentioned the military component of our interaction. We regularly conduct joint exercises, and we are also promoting interaction between our security agencies, defence ministries and general staffs. This is certainly benefitting our countries. Your military professionals undergo training at our universities. A few words about our efforts and joint activities on the international stage, including as regards a settlement in Kosovo. As you are aware, our position of principle is not vulnerable to current political factors. We support your position on Kosovo. I hope that a solution will eventually be found that will meet the interests of all people living in the region. Aleksandar Vucic: Thank you for your kind words. Our military-technical cooperation has certainly reached a very high level. We are grateful to you for the wonderful presents, which we have received, and for the standards of our cooperation. I believe that we will sign many more agreements in various spheres. I believe that our intergovernmental commission is working at the highest and best possible level and that we will see the best possible results in the future. I would like to thank you once again. <…>"

Regarding developments on the Belarus-EU border, the emphasis on both sides was on the importance of resolving the migration crisis in conformity with the norms of international humanitarian law. Support was affirmed for systematic EU-Minsk cooperation, as agreed during President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko's telephone conversations with Acting Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel. In this context, Vladimir Putin described as counterproductive the intentions of European states to impose another round of sanctions on Belarus. The use of water cannon, tear gas, stun grenades and other riot control means by Polish security forces was raised. Hope was expressed that Charles Michel would work with Warsaw to prevent violence against the migrants and actions that might inflame the situation. During an exchange on the domestic Ukrainian conflict, it was emphasised that there is no alternative to the Minsk Package of Measures as the foundation for a settlement. The President of Russia expressed concern over Ukraine's continued provocations aimed at fuelling tensions on the contact line. The need for Kiev to end its policy of discrimination against its Russian-speaking population, in violation of Ukraine's international commitments, was also addressed. At the request of Mr Michel, Vladimir Putin informed him about the steps taken to implement the provisions of the trilateral agreements on Nagorno-Karabakh of November 9, 2020, and January 11, 2021. These agreements will make it possible to restore peaceful life and rebuild economic and transport ties in the South Caucasus.

Is everybody present? Let us get down to work. Today, we will review social matters, and we will discuss them in greater detail at the end of the interactive videoconference. Now, I would like to ask Ms Golikova to report on the current COVID-19 response efforts. Ms Golikova, you have the floor. Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova: Good afternoon, Mr President. Good afternoon, colleagues. Following the 46th week of 2021, the incidence of the novel coronavirus in the Russian Federation dropped by 6.1 percent and totalled 175.6 cases per 100,000 population. At the same time, we usually discuss the breakdown across the Russian Federation. I would like to say that the three capital regions, namely, Moscow, Moscow Region and St Petersburg, now account for 20.8 percent of all COVID-19 cases, and the remaining territory of the Russian Federation accounts for 79.2 percent. At the same time, we should keep in mind that, following the 44th week, or two weeks ago, the central region, or these three territories of the Russian Federation, accounted for 30 percent, and we are posting a marked decrease in local morbidity rates. (Tatyana Golikova went on to provide detailed information on the number of cases in different regions and hospital bed capacity.) Unfortunately, we have not yet noted a significant decrease in the mortality rate nationwide. More than 1,200 of our citizens still die every day. These are serious and dramatic statistics. To reiterate, mostly people 60 and older pass away and, as a rule, they suffered from chronic diseases and were enrolled in regular medical exam programmes. Unfortunately, the absolute majority of them were not vaccinated. Therefore, herd immunity remains our most important goal. To date, this stands at 50.4 percent and the necessary number of citizens has already been vaccinated with the first dose in six regions which will make it possible to achieve the planned herd immunity of 80 percent (including the people who have been ill with COVID-19). We teamed up with researchers and immunisation specialists and, based on the findings in domestic and international studies, discussed in detail the optimal timeline for getting a booster jab for people who have been sick with COVID-19. We came to the conclusion that vaccination certificates for them should remain valid for one year. We came up with this decision because, like other countries, we are monitoring the patients who have been sick and the people who became ill after vaccination, as well as other aftereffects of the disease or vaccination. Our monitoring shows that the number of patients who have fallen ill the second time as a percentage of the total number of patients who have been ill with COVID-19 is 0.74 percent as of today. We are keeping our recommendation to get a booster jab six months after the first vacination and for people who have been ill. According to international studies and our studies, immunity wears off six months after the jab, so we recommend getting a booster jab to keep it at the proper level. (Ms Golikova also shared the experience gained from observing people who have been ill with COVID-19.) Mr President, I would like to report to you that today the Ministry of Health will register the Gamaleya Centre's Gam-COVID-Vak-M vaccine for children 12–17 years old. Unfortunately, the disease rate among children is high today – much higher than it was during the first and second waves. Therefore, we need to take appropriate action in this respect as well. Finally, I would like to voice some ideas. Times flies and we are on the eve of the new year. To avoid a new surge of the disease we must continue observing the restrictions we have jointly developed. I would also like to point out to the regions the need to ensure properly operating healthcare systems during the holidays and to build a reserve of necessary medications and other things required for countering the COVID pandemic. We have transferred funds to the regions. We will soon make the decision to transfer another 89 billion rubles to support the mandatory medical insurance system. The Finance Ministry has approved these figures and the Government will make the relevant decision on them. (Further, replying to the President's questions, the Deputy Prime Minister specified recommendations on revaccination and described in detail suggestions on vaccinating children. Ms Golikova also said the vaccine for children could appear in public circulation by late December). Vladimir Putin: Overall, I believe vaccination should be voluntary, especially for children. You have described the procedures for the potential use of these vaccines. In any event, they must be available. Therefore, I would like to ask the Government to пшму due attention to this, to finance everything properly and on time, to monitor how this work is going and to support the specialists that are doing it. Ms Golikova, I have one more suggestion; I wonder if this is expedient. I believe it is possible and easy to analyse the life span and the fatality rates in the regions with good vaccination records – you mentioned 80 percent – and in those that have not yet achieved this level. I believe this would be fairly easy and would not take much time. Tatyana Golikova: Mr President, we are doing this; we are monitoring the situation but considering that the lifespan figures are annual indicators in Russia, we would still like to wait until the end of the 12 months. Then we will be able to report these results to you. Vladimir Putin: Yes, please, look at the impact of vaccination on this. I believe this is not too difficult. Tatyana Golikova: We will. Vladimir Putin: Mr Mishustin, go ahead, please. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin: Mr President, I would like to add something. You have given instructions, some of them to me personally, to cooperate with the Gamaleya National Research Centre in organising clinical trials for the Gam-COVID-Vac nasal spray vaccine, to provide the necessary support. Preclinical trials have been completed; they have shown that the vaccine is safe and that it works. The programme for clinical trials has also been prepared, and accordingly, approval has been issued to start the first phase with adult volunteers. This is done to reconfirm safety and efficacy and to adjust the dosage. Based on the results, 42 days after we start, an interim report will be prepared for the new vaccine's registration; Phase 3 clinical trials will begin at the same time. We have allocated the necessary funds for this. Mr President, we all watched your meeting with Deputy Director of the Gamaleya Centre Denis Logunov – it was on television. We are collaborating with him. We heard you were planning to volunteer. I would like to ask you about this specifically, is this so? You will need to fill out a special permit. Vladimir Putin: I am a very typical case, nothing unusual here. As Ms Golikova has just said, exactly six months after vaccination, my protective titers dropped, and the specialists recommended getting a booster jab, which I did a few days ago. That was an injection, and the next day, after I spoke to Mr Logunov, he personally administered the second part of the procedure, he gave me that nasal spray. Do you want to know what it was like? It was also a syringe, but instead of a liquid substance, he drew some powder with it, asked me to take a deep breath on the count of three, sprayed on one side, then on the other, and then I was asked to sit for 15 minutes – and that was it. To be honest, I did not feel anything, just nothing. I just sat there for 15 minutes and then left. After these two procedures – the injection and the nasal spray – I exercised this morning. So, I can testify that it is exactly the way our scientists and experts say, absolutely. Let us see what the result will be in terms of increasing protective antibody titers. Mikhail Mishustin: Mr President, we wish you, as well as all our citizens, good health. Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much. I recommend that everyone get vaccinated and get a booster jab as soon as feasible, which is extremely important. At one of our meetings, Ms Golikova said that in order for us to achieve the required level of herd immunity, we need to complete the first phase of vaccination in order to start revaccination in a timely manner, and then our people will be fully protected as is the case in the Armed Forces where most of the people are young and healthy, but were still vaccinated and got a booster shot, and are serving and working with confidence. By the way, in other military organisations – I know this from reports – at the first stage, despite the fact that we are talking about young and healthy people, there were quite serious problems with COVID. Unfortunately, this disease resulted in personnel losses. Once we were past this bitter period of first getting acquainted with the disease, got everyone vaccinated and revaccinated, the situation returned to normal in the entire military organisation. So let us follow this path, as I said, calmly, without any fuss and without imposing vaccination on the people. Let us instead use persuasion and make the necessary decisions in a timely fashion. I also count on the leaders of the regions of the Russian Federation, who initially – in fact, just like many other countries, since many countries followed our lead – were given an opportunity to make decisions based on conditions in their particular region. Regional leaders have a huge responsibility for making the necessary decisions in a timely manner. I strongly count on your statesmanlike approach to your duties in this regard. Let us move on to other items as planned. <…> Vladimir Putin: The issues [related to ensuring the necessary level of wages in the public sector] are an absolute priority, they are of importance because they concern the interests of millions of people working in the public sector. Before summing up the results of our discussion, I would like to thank the State Duma deputies for supporting the proposed amendments to the draft law on the budget. The matter concerns an increase in the subsistence level and minimum wages. I would like to remind you that the subsistence level next year will be 12,654 rubles and the minimum wage, 13,890 rubles in absolute figures throughout the country. I would like to repeat that increasing these figures leads to the growth of many social benefits, including payments to families with children and pension supplements, and will be used as the benchmark for setting wages in the economic sectors. The subject of today's meeting is related to the people's incomes as well, the incomes of those who are employed in healthcare, education, science, culture and the social sector, that is, social protection. We must do whatever is necessary, everything that is possible to ensure that people receive decent wages. The targets were set out in the May 2012 executive orders, as our colleagues have already pointed out. I would like to emphasise once again that these parameters, which are connected to the average income in every region's economy, must be scrupulously complied with. They serve as the basis for federal and regional budgets. It has already been mentioned here that the average payroll in the economy has surpassed the forecast. (Further, at the President's request, Economic Development Minister Maxim Reshetnikov provided figures related to wage increases and also current forecasts in this sphere, with due regard for inflation and other factors.) Vladimir Putin: Yes, these are positive figures indeed, and this is very good, with the exception of the rise in inflation, which means that unless we allocate additional funds, wages in the public sector may lag behind the targets of the May 2012 executive orders. We must not allow this to happen under any circumstances. We must not permit this, especially since our doctors and other medical personnel, and teachers are working in extremely difficult, extraordinary conditions. I am referring to the pandemic restrictions. They are working selflessly and at full capacity, and all requirements concerning their wages must be complied with. I would like the Government and the heads of regions to pay special attention to the following. It is necessary to ensure 100-percent implementation of the May executive orders based on the actual growth rate of the average wage across the economy in 2021 and on the parameters that the Economic Development Minister has just described. I ask the Government to provide additional funds and render support to the regions in attaining the required level of public sector pay, the way we did previously while implementing the May executive orders starting in 2012. Please finalise these matters and think of what the Chelyabinsk Region Governor has just said. You should also keep in mind the proposals made by the Ministry of Finance: they are quite sound and it is only necessary to avoid a fixation on some formal solutions and to proceed from the specific situation in each constituent entity of the Russian Federation. I would like to put a separate emphasis on the following – this was mentioned here earlier, and I fully agree with it and want to stress it once again: the 5,000 rubles in additional payments made to school and college teachers (the latter must not be forgotten either) for class tutorship should not be counted in as part of their regular salary. These extras are meant as additional support: we shall proceed from this in the future and I ask everyone to allow no other interpretations. This principle also fully applies to the extras paid to the medics working with COVID-19 patients. All these instructions must be put into practice before the end of this year and therefore all the clearances we have just mentioned are to be obtained within the shortest possible period of time. It is important to pass the decisions that are necessary for this with maximum speed to make it possible for public sector employees to get paid in the amount envisaged by the parameters of the 2012 May executive orders before the end of 2021. Based on this year's performance, it is also necessary to envisage the need for funds to implement the May executive orders next year. I would like to ask the Government to keep the implementation of this task under its special scrutiny. Thank you very much for today's joint work. All the best."

We certainly should meet regularly and maintain our relations. It is very important to exchange current, relevant information on how the situation is developing in the Middle East as a whole and on the Palestinian track in particular. This is why I would like first of all to thank you for accepting our invitation. We understand the environment in which we all live, including the Palestinian people today. COVID-19 is contributing to the situation, on top of the pressure brought to bear from the outside and the tensions that exist in the region and with[your] neighbours. You know that Russia is making efforts to help Palestine in this regard: we are providing medicines and vaccines; Russian specialists and medical workers visit Palestine. In absolute figures, our trade is still modest, but we observe its growth, despite all these problems, by more than 30 percent last year. Regrettably, the pandemic has led to a failure in the work of the Intergovernmental Commission– we should, of course, organise this work as soon as possible. But the most important thing I would like to say is this: the Russian Federation's position on Palestine and as regards solving the Palestinian problem remains unchanged. The Palestinian problem should be solved in keeping with the earlier UN Security Council resolutions and on a just basis that takes into account the interests of all people living in this region, on the basis of the two-state concept. And we will certainly work towards this, no matter how difficult this might be. Mr President, I think that in the course of today's meeting we will exchange more detailed information on what is taking place right now and what the current situation is at the present, and we will think together of what can be done to make headway. Mr President, your visit is a happy occasion for me. Welcome!

This is a highly important matter. Head of the Federal Taxation Service Daniil Yegorov Yegorov DaniilHead of the Federal Taxation Service: Good afternoon, Mr President. We are seeing very good tax revenues on a par with economic growth. The Federal Taxation Service manages 80 percent of the tax revenues of all budgets, including extra-budgetary funds. Consequently, we prioritise the system's sustainable, high-quality performance. In January-October, we obtained revenues worth 23 trillion rubles, or 37 percent more than 2020 levels. Considering the abnormal 2020 period, even compared to 2019, we have boosted revenues by 23 percent, and we are still seeing substantial growth. Regarding our forecast for late 2021, total revenue will reach 28 trillion rubles, up seven trillion rubles. Vladimir Putin: On 2020 levels? Daniil Yegorov: Yes, Mr President, on 2020 levels. In this regard, the figures are pretty good. This concerns the economy, as well as rising hydrocarbon and metals prices. All these factors have generated a positive effect, and we should also add the tax management effect. Regarding income tax, as reflected by wage balance sheets, we have expanded these volumes by 17 percent, and small businesses are achieving 20 percent growth. Vladimir Putin: Does this indirectly prove that real wages are on the rise? Daniil Yegorov: Yes, you are absolutely right. In our opinion, the assistance to small businesses last year greatly affected wage indicators. By the way, we have also assisted businesses since early 2021. We manage subsidy payments, and this programme swung into action in early November, as per your instruction. This includes subsidies for maintaining corporate wages. We have already paid over 22 billion rubles to more than 300 companies and to thousands of companies run by individual entrepreneurs that employ over 1.7 million people. Vladimir Putin: All right, let's discuss more specific matters. You go ahead, please. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67157,Meeting with Deputy Director of Gamaleya Centre Denis Logunov,2021-11-21T19:45:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region","Vladimir Putin has been re-vaccinated against the coronavirus with Sputnik Light. Afterwards, the President had a meeting with Deputy Director of the Gamaleya National Centre of Epidemiology and Microbiology Denis Logunov.","President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Logunov, first of all, thank you for coming. Today, on your recommendation, and that of your colleagues, I received another jab, this time with Sputnik Light. This is now called re-vaccination. And in connection to this– you and I do not meet very often, but regularly, but in fact I have regular conferences with the management of the institute– today we have a chance to discuss all those topics that worry our people, our citizens. You can share your vision of the situation, whether vaccination and re-vaccination is necessary, and talk about the results of using Sputnik Light both in Russia and abroad. But still, let us begin with the first and foremost question: why and when it is necessary to vaccinate and on what ground the decision to re-vaccinate should be made. Deputy Director of Gamaleya National Centre of Epidemiology and Microbiology Denis Logunov: Yes, Mr President, this is really the most important question, and, of course, it did not appear out of nowhere. The fact is that there are electronic registers in Russia, exactly like the registers for recording infection rates abroad. I am referring to such leading countries as the US, Europe, and Israel. We can see in these registers that rates are decreasing– both in Russian and foreign ones. It is not a dramatic drop, but a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccinations six to eight months after the first injection. And, naturally, the first impulse of any researcher and of any doctor would be to recommend revaccination with another dose. This is not some new innovation: this route has been used many times during vaccination campaigns. I can say for sure that according to our and foreign data, as well as international practice, we can see that the introduction of a third dose, introduction of re-vaccination into medical practice, brings the decrease in effectiveness back to its initial level, and even higher, sometimes 1.6 or two times higher than after the first dose. I am referring to the rate of effectiveness. We can see this from the morbidity index. So, this approach, re-vaccination, is working. It has proved its effectiveness, so, of course, it has found its way into the recommendations of the world's leading regulators, as well as in the Russian Healthcare Ministry. Vladimir Putin: Do you mean that re-vaccination is required after a certain amount of time after vaccination, six months on average? Denis Logunov: Yes, correct, six months, and, according to our recommended practice, I believe that re-vaccination should occur after six months under unfavourable epidemiologic conditions. Unfavourable conditions are determined by the Federal Service for the Oversight of Consumer Protection and Welfare and the Chief Sanitary Doctor. Under conditions when we no longer see a pandemic or epidemic spike, vaccination is possible and will be recommended once a year. Vladimir Putin: Do you mean now or later? Denis Logunov: Naturally, this will happen later. Right now, we are experiencing an unfavourable period, so at the moment we are talking about six months. Vladimir Putin: Then the next question is– I know you are also developing a nasal spray vaccine. Denis Logunov: That's right. I would like to say that this is not a new way either. We have extensive experience in the development of vaccines, primarily in our country, and in particular, we know such examples as the polio vaccine. We also know that vaccines administered through parenteral method, or intramuscular injection, are effective, but they have limited ability to induce immunity from so-called breakthrough infection and symptomatic illness. We need to deliver the agent through the mucous membranes to induce barrier immunity. When it comes to COVID-19, barrier immunity refers to our immune organs located in the nose and the pharynx. To induce barrier immunity, we had to create a vaccine that is delivered nasally. Therefore, we have in fact developed such a nasal agent and we plan to start using it in the near future. It just needs a little finalising, then it will go into clinical tests, and after that, we certainly plan to begin the new vaccine rollout. This will be an additional barrier. First, it is convenient for vaccination, it is painless, with an absolute minimum of side effects. On top of that, we will achieve the most important thing– first, primary parenteral vaccination will induce systemic immunity, and then the intranasal immunisation will create an additional barrier, mucosal immunity in the upper respiratory tract. Vladimir Putin: Speaking of painless, I was given a shot just two hours ago, and I do not feel anything, I am feeling normal, everything is fine. As for this nasal agent– are you still testing its efficacy? Or what are you working on exactly? Denis Logunov: Mr President, I must confess it is an off-label administration basically, as usual, we are testing it on our employees. Vladimir Putin: So it is just an experiment. Denis Logunov: It is. Vladimir Putin: Can I take part in this experiment? Denis Logunov: Of course, Mr President. Vladimir Putin: Alright, we will discuss the details… Denis Logunov: If you sign an informed consent, you can participate. Vladimir Putin: Agreed, I will definitely sign it. We can do it today. People are still concerned about the effectiveness of our vaccine. You actually headed the group of researchers who created Sputnik V. In fact, you and your colleagues are the creators of this medication. Over 50 million people have been inoculated with this vaccine in Russia and many more, over 100 million or more, approximately 120 million people, have received it around the world, in the countries that have recognised and are using it. This amounts to considerable data for analysis. What are its results? Denis Logunov: Mr President, you are absolutely right, this is exactly how many doses have been used, first of all, thanks to the efforts of the Russian Direct Investment Fund. It is thanks to the RDIF that 71 countries have registered the Sputnik V and Sputnik Light vaccines. At present, the most important information has come from Argentina, and we also received independent data from San Marino. With the help of our Argentinean colleagues, we have established that the effectiveness of Sputnik Light there is 78 percent, but the Delta strain has not reached the country yet. Therefore, we can gauge the vaccine's effectiveness against the Delta strain on the example of San Marino, where it is around 80 percent, or 78 percent depending on the analysis set, but we can say confidently that it is around 80 percent, and it is not the immediate effect but effectiveness five months later. We can make the same conclusion based on Russian studies. We conducted mostly cohort studies on the Delta strain among military personnel deployed in Moscow and the Moscow Region. The effectiveness against this strain is 83 percent. What does this mean? Yes, we can see a decline from 92–95 percent– the figure was as high as 98 percent in Bahrain– but the vaccine nevertheless remains effective, and its effectiveness is much higher than the 50 percent threshold set for COVID-19 vaccines by the WHO. At the same time, Mr President, I would like to point out that we continue to keep abreast of the developments, as we discussed it with you the first time, and that we are not satisfied with the figures and achievements, because the virus is changing indeed, and so this is not the time to become complacent. Of course, we have been working on all of the so-called VOCs, the variants of concern, as translated from the English. We have examined all the required vaccine strains, including the Delta strain. Moreover, we have completed the development and even produced a small batch of the two components: the first one is based on Adenovirus Serotype 26, and the second one relies on Adenovirus Serotype 5. That is to say that if needed, if we discover that the vaccine becomes, all of a sudden, much less effective, we may well use this product as part of clinical trials on the intranasal vaccine. Vladimir Putin: Mr Logunov, what was the jab I received today? Was it Sputnik Light or simply the first component? Denis Logunov: You received Sputnik Light. In fact, this is the first component. Let me explain. In our studies and observations, we found that in more than 80 percent of cases one injection was enough to boost immunity, making the second component unnecessary in most cases. Some people have a suppressed immune response, and there are all kinds of conditions that undermine the immune system, and in these instances people need to receive the full Sputnik V vaccine. However, if there are no medical grounds of this kind, Sputnik Light is enough as a booster jab. Vladimir Putin: Is the jab I got today the same as the first component in terms of volume? Denis Logunov: Yes, exactly the same. Vladimir Putin: Mr Logunov, the vaccination of children has been a matter of concern for many people, which is a natural thing. Have you worked on this issue? If we do get a vaccine of this kind, when will this happen? Denis Logunov: Of course, we are working on this. We have completed the first two stages in the clinical trials, which demonstrated a high level of tolerance. First, we determined the dose that would be safe for kids. We also discovered that the average immunological potency is much higher in kids compared to adults. As such, we have every reason to believe… Vladimir Putin: What do you mean by immunological potency? Can you explain in plain language? Denis Logunov: I am referring to the number of antibodies in the blood samples after receiving the jab. Children have a much higher count compared to adults, while the dosage is lower. Moreover, kids seem to tolerate the vaccine very well. We reported about this not only to the Healthcare Ministry, but also to the Data Safety Monitoring Board, and we have an independent expert opinion on the safety of this vaccine. For this reason, we expect… Vladimir Putin: Sorry for interrupting you, but have you changed anything compared to Sputnik V or is this a lower dose of the same vaccine, adjusted for a smaller body weight? Denis Logunov: You're right. The dose was adjusted based on patient's weight, also taking into account the age-specific characteristics of immunity. Vladimir Putin: So basically, you used the same formula? Denis Logunov: Absolutely the same, yes, Mr President. Nothing else has changed. Vladimir Putin: So, in principle, after using it on 120, even 170 million people, this suggests that, if adjusted for patient's weight, the same formula can be used on children. Denis Logunov: Yes, certainly. Vladimir Putin: I see. So you primarily rely on practice, am I right? Denis Logunov: Absolutely. We now have a huge background and can demonstrate safety based not only on the experience in the Russian Federation, but we also have independent expert opinion from Argentine doctors, and European doctors. This, I think, is very important. Vladimir Putin: Yes, this is very, very important, indeed. This means it is not some obscure domestic drug, but independent experts in the countries that use it have provided objective information on how it works. Denis Logunov: More than that, they have published it in independent scientific journals, without any comments or reviews from the Gamaleya Centre or anyone else from the Russian Federation. That is, it is a truly independent appraisal. Vladimir Putin: Another important question is of course about potential medicines for the treatment of the coronavirus infection. Denis Logunov: Indeed, Mr President, it is also a very important matter. Because we can keep the infection under control, declare that it is manageable, only if we have not just the preventive treatment schemes, but also have an option for cases when a patient actually has the infection– regardless of whether they might have been given chemotherapy, or have a primary immunodeficiency due to some genetic factors– for this part of the population, we must certainly have medicines, because vaccines will not be able to protect them well enough. The Gamaleya Centre is working on at least two strategies. The first is monoclonal antibodies. It is the same type of medication that was used to treat Donald Trump, and its development is almost finished. First of all, we managed to demonstrate in experiments on transgenic animals that it can provide full protection. Clinical trials will begin very soon. I hope we will get authorisation in January. And I hope that in the next three to five months, the medicine will be approved. The Gamaleya Centre is only partially in control as it depends on how soon we can find volunteers for the trial. Still, in the foreseeable future, we will be able to have this treatment registered, as per Government Regulation 441 that specifically addresses COVID-19 medications. Another area of research is, of course, chemotherapy using chemical substances. Here, we are in the early stages because the funding programme became available and, essentially, the actual possibility to discover a certain class of substances arose relatively recently. We have conducted initial screening and identified the""hits"" among compounds(sorry for the lab jargon), the leading compounds that will be improved and tested in further experiments on animals. This will require more time and I think that by the end of 2022, we will be able to have this medication registered– obviously provided that, the tests on animals and the clinical trials are successful. Vladimir Putin: When I received my jab about six months ago, they told me I should refrain from getting another vaccine(a flu jab, for example) because the number of COVID-19 vaccines and data on their effectiveness was still insufficient. So, I was told to wait at least a month before getting a flu jab– or vice versa, first flu jab and then, after a month, a COVID-19 jab. You have analysed how such a vast number of people– 170 million in Russia and all over the world– responded to your vaccine, Sputnik V. Do you think, given the current flu season and high ARVI incidence, that people can get jabbed with one vaccine after another or are they better to wait for a while? After all, the immune system has to first become adapted to just one medicine, does it not? Denis Logunov: Mr President, actually this is the most difficult question, because it has many aspects. First, speaking of efficiency, we have made tests and run special experiments. We were administering two vaccines– against COVID-19 and against flu– simultaneously. In this case, there are just two tentative scenarios. Either the vaccines block each other because of their competing antigens, that is, they reciprocally reduce their efficiency, or– and there are also scientific grounds for that– they can both get more effective owing to decussation and the boost that immunity's helper segment gives to each during vaccination. We have shown that the flu vaccine becomes much more effective if it is administered along with the vaccine against COVID-19, Sputnik V. So, in this sense, there are no restrictions on use. But there is also a formal aspect related to safety. To determine the degree of safety, all these combinations should be tried and tested under clinical conditions. So far, this has not been done, because there is always a shortage of time for testing all the combinations with regard to all the vaccines. But at this moment, it is enough to wait for two weeks, since, in my opinion, this is the period in which there are primary inflammatory reactions, which are entirely over within two weeks. After two weeks, therefore, we are guaranteed against any complications and this cannot be regarded as a concurrent use. On the other hand, however, we are clearly aware that one vaccine will not do harm to another. Vladimir Putin: But still, what is the sequence? First you get jabbed against flu and two weeks later– against COVID-19. Or vice versa. Is that right? Denis Logunov: Quite right! Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much. <…>"

You have chosen the path of spiritual and moral service and you are pursuing it with dignity, wisdom and deep understanding of the responsibility for the destiny of our people and Russia. Obviously, the Church has been through both good and hard times, but currently its voice has acquired momentous significance again; it is being heeded and trusted. To a great degree this is the result of your personal efforts and relentless pastoral labour, sincere care about infusing the ideals of peace, justice, love and mutual understanding into people's hearts. Under your thoughtful spiritual guidance, the Church is actively participating in the life of society, in resolving current social issues and in implementing large-scale projects, which matter for the entire country. Your fruitful pastoral service has garnered you the highest regard not only in Russia but also abroad, as well as respect among millions of believers in our vast country. I also want to note your immense contribution to promoting the traditional values of our peoples and to the preservation of our historical and cultural heritage. Today, as we fight the coronavirus pandemic, your call to unite in the face of the threat inspires the Russian Orthodox clergy, volunteers and all those who carry out the merciful mission of helping the sick, those in need of support and a spiritual pillar. Your Holiness, it is a great and tremendous honour for me to commend your merits and work for the good of our Motherland and to decorate you with Russia's top award– the Order of St Andrew the Apostle the First-Called, a particularly revered educator and missionary of the Christian faith. One again, I congratulate you on your birthday. I wish you good health and success in your noble service. Patriarch Kirill Kirill Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia: Your Excellency, Mr President, I wholeheartedly thank you for your kind words about my humble contribution, and, of course, for this order, Russia's highest award. The Order of St Andrew the First-Called is a state award but it is no coincidence that it was instituted in honour of Apostle Andrew. He was one of the twelve apostles who shed the light of Christ's truth onto the land which is today a significant part of Russia. In this respect the order in a certain sense is not only a token of state recognition but also a sacred object for it bears the image of St Andrew the First-Called. Given that the Order of Andrew the First-Called, the enlightener of our land, is the highest order in contemporary Russia, I would like to speak about the changes in the life of our people and the changes in the people themselves. We all know that""there is no man that sinneth not,"" according to a church maxim. And there is nobody who lives their lives without making mistakes. There are also collective mistakes, and we know that there were such mistakes in the history of our country and our people. At the end of the 20th and the turn of the 21st century our life– the life of the state, society as well personal lives of a great multitude of people– took on an amazing configuration in that we realise that we live in a happy country. Even though there are problems and we all are well aware of them, we have the key: we are free, we are independent, we have preserved our culture, we have preserved our faith. Our people have survived despite the hardest tribulations of the 20th century. Today, Russia is marching forward along its historic path with a large reserve of strength, and it is you who leads our Fatherland in this special period of our history. Thank you for the award and I would also like to express gratitude to you on behalf of the Russian Orthodox Church and on my own behalf for your unfading attention to spiritual life, for your balancing of politics and morals, for your commitment to building the life of our Fatherland based not only on law, but also on the truth. We are grateful for that. I know that a huge number of the sons and daughters of the Russian Orthodox Church wholeheartedly support my words today. Thank you once again for the high award. Allow me to wish you good health, God's help, many years of life and success in further governing the Russian state. Vladimir Putin: You Holiness, thank you very much. To conclude this ceremony, which could be called modest even though it is a grand event, but it is modest because we all have to live under certain restrictions due to the pandemic, as I have said, but which is, nonetheless, a ceremony marking a great occasion, this is what I would like to say in conclusion. We are certainly well aware that the state's achievements in the economy lie at the foundation of the country's wellbeing, its economic progress and strengthening its defence capabilities. This is a basic matter which defies any arguments. Yet there are deeper issues. Both the economy and everything related to it depend on the spiritual underpinnings of any society that unify this society into a single whole. And society and the state only succeed when they unite into that whole. Your Holiness, you are the person who is attending to the core– our faith, our spiritual values, our basic principles, and you truly do it from the bottom of your heart with full dedication. I once again express my genuine gratitude and wish you all the very best. My congratulations. Patriarch Kirill: Thank you."

The VEB RF State Development Corporation concluded loan agreements with joint-stock companies Almalyk Mining and Metallurgical Plant and Uzbekneftegaz.*** President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, First of all, I would like to congratulate you on your sweeping victory at the presidential election. We have spoken many times about your first steps as President of Uzbekistan and mentioned that there is important and difficult work ahead. President of the Republic of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev: It is hard work. Vladimir Putin: Yes, it is, but you are doing fine. You are moving forward confidently, upgrading the country, and already there are results. The people can see and feel this, which is why they have reacted positively to what you have accomplished over the past few years. I would like to wholeheartedly congratulate you on this and to wish you success during your next presidential term. I am confident that cooperation between Russia and Uzbekistan will help increase Uzbekistan's capabilities and improve the wellbeing of its citizens. Uzbekistan is not only a close neighbour but also an ally, this is how we regard Uzbekistan. It is a major regional country, with which we have many links, both historically and in the current period. At present, Russia accounts for 18 percent of Uzbekistan's trade. Our mutual trade is increasing: last year it went up by over 15 percent, despite the pandemic. It is a very good indicator showing that we continue interacting quite successfully even in the most difficult periods. Russia is making considerable investments in Uzbekistan worth over $10 billion. There are interesting projects and work is underway in all spheres both in the regional and nationwide formats. This concerns the economy, humanitarian ties and the transport infrastructure. There is a large scope for cooperation, and we certainly have so much to talk about. I am delighted to see you. We actually have not met for a long time. Welcome. Shavkat Mirziyoyev: Thank you very much. Mr President, thank you very much for the congratulations. In reality, and we have talked about this a lot, I believe the outcome of the presidential election in Uzbekistan was one of the positive results of our cooperation. First, I am grateful to you for inviting me to visit Russia and for such a warm reception. I would like to emphasise that we have made a breakthrough in our relations over the past few years– we never had such figures before. As you said, our trade is growing: in the last nine months, it already amounted to $5 billion and will reach $7 billion by the end of the year. I am very grateful to you for your support for our mutual agreements. The Intergovernmental Commission headed by the prime ministers is doing a working very well– you supported this and it was very instrumental. Ministers and sub-commissions are all working. Much was done before the visit. We had three big forums: a regional, an educational and a media forum. As for the results, we are now working on projects worth a total of $14 billion. Some of the projects were produced by the inter-regional forum– when we launched it three years ago, we had nothing like this. The results are impressive: meetings between representatives of the regions are a big incentive. Over 35 agreements were signed following the education forum the day before yesterday. In the past three years, we have opened 11 affiliates of Russian universities. Now we already have 15 affiliates: recently we opened a branch of Pirogov University. Cultural and humanitarian cooperation is also making steady progress. This also applies to the military-technical cooperation, which you mentioned, and our transport ties. Our parliaments have developed very good relations– this was not the case before, either. They are working very hard to monitor what is being done and to fulfil their tasks. I believe we have things to discuss because now we have a completely different level of relations. We are intensifying our integration in all areas and it is intensive– before we had agreements between regions and now, we have projects that produce added value. These are serious projects. We have exchanged views on them. We have big projects in metallurgy and they are progressing well. I think today is a good opportunity to discuss these issues– inter-regional, bilateral, security issues and the problem of Afghanistan. I think this is a very good occasion to review serious issues with a view to the future. Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much. Thank you for your visit. <…>"

And, of course, it is highly important that the Strategy for the Development of the National Qualifications System of the Russian Federation for the Period until 2030 as well as its main goals and priorities were officially approved earlier this year, which happened largely due to the effective collaboration between the government, the business community, and civil society. I would like to stress that we have many large-scale and challenging tasks ahead, tasks designed to achieve a qualitative improvement in the system of training competent specialists, while taking into account both current and future requirements. There are many things directly hinging on this, including the emergence of a modern, competitive labour market, the successful implementation of advanced, highly needed innovative projects, and the generally sustainable development of the national economy. I am confident that your forum, which is being attended by employers and representatives of government agencies and trade unions, as well as public and educational organisations, will be held in a creative and constructive manner and will enable you to share your experience and best practices and outline plans and milestones for the future."""

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67124,Meeting on social issues,2021-11-18T18:35:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin held a videoconference meeting on social issues.,"Taking part in the meeting were Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Anton Vaino, Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova, Presidential Aide Maxim Oreshkin, Minister of Labour and Social Protection Anton Kotyakov, and Deputy Finance Minister Pavel Kadochnikov. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, welcome again. I would like to sum up some results of our discussions, meetings we had recently on social policy, including the meeting held yesterday. We discussed crucial issues, which, of course, our people are worried about. They are related to increase in incomes, improving wellbeing and the quality of people's lives, which, in fact, concern everyone. Let me stress the following: the social block is key to our state policy and is a key priority of the federal budget. State Duma deputies are also working hard on it. In this context, I would like to outline a number of issues that require joint action of the legislative and executive powers. First, the draft federal budget for next year now envisages adjusting the subsistence level by 2.5 percent. Of course, this is not enough, because such parameters lag significantly behind the current inflation rate, which has accelerated in recent months. I suggest setting a higher subsistence level for 2022 and increasing it at a faster pace than inflation, by 8.6 percent. In absolute terms, the average subsistence wage in the country must reach 12,654 rubles a month, which is 1,000 rubles more than today. Let me add that the subsistence minimum is related to many social benefits, such as payments to families with children, additional social payments and pension supplements; therefore, it is not the absolute figure that is important, but what it is related to. And let me remind you that these benefits are paid to millions of our citizens. Of course, these payments will also grow. Second. Under the Russian Constitution, the minimum wage cannot be less than the subsistence minimum, which means the minimum wage should increase along with indexation of the subsistence minimum. Next year, it should also grow by 1,100 rubles, or 8.6 percent. Thus, the minimum wage next year will be 13,890 rubles per month. This decision impacts many of our citizens, and again, the thing is that the minimum wage is used to calculate benefits for temporary disability and also serves as a guideline when setting salaries in the public sector, in economic sectors. I would ask the Presidential Executive Office to prepare amendments on the increased indexation of the subsistence minimum and the minimum wage in 2022. In the coming days I will submit them to the State Duma, so I would ask the deputies to support them during the second reading of the draft law on federal budget. And, finally, the third very important thing – no less important than the two points mentioned above: at the United Russia party congress, I said that the rate of pension indexation should be higher than actual inflation. At the same time, let me remind you that since 2019 we have strictly adhered to this rule. Today, given the significant increase in inflation, it would be a mistake to deviate from this principle. Proposals on specific parameters for indexing pensions are now being worked out both by the Government and the Presidential Executive Office, and the deputies are considering this issue as well. We will return to this in the near future taking into account how the macroeconomic indicators develop. We also talked about this yesterday, I would ask you to keep this in mind and submit proposals soon.  Thank you very much. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67123,Expanded meeting of the Foreign Ministry Board,2021-11-18T16:50:00Z,Moscow,Vladimir Putin took part in the expanded meeting of the Foreign Ministry Board.,"The meeting was devoted to the implementation of national foreign policy and future tasks of Russian diplomacy. * * * Speech at the expanded meeting of the Foreign Ministry Board President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Lavrov, colleagues, I would like to welcome everyone here to the expanded meeting of the Foreign Ministry Board. Today, our agenda is focused on the implementation of Russia's foreign policy and priority tasks for the future, taking into account the adopted amendments to the Constitution, which also concern foreign policy. Importantly, our Fundamental Law has now sealed such basic ideas and values as loyalty to the homeland, respect for our native tongue, history, culture and traditions of our predecessors. This is everything that unites our people around common ideals and determines the vector for the development of the sovereign, independent and peace-loving Russian state, an active member of the international community. We will also fix the specific areas of foreign policy, of our diplomatic work in today's difficult international conditions in the new version of the Foreign Policy Concept that is now being drafted. This document, along with the National Security Strategy endorsed this summer, will, actually, become a roadmap for the Foreign Ministry and other ministries and departments. The main thing is that our foreign policy should continue ensuring the most comfortable and secure conditions for Russia's development, resolving ambitious socioeconomic tasks and improving the living standards of our people. With this in mind, Russia is committed to developing partnership and mutually beneficial constructive relations with all countries and regional associations. We will proactively participate in international efforts to counter common challenges and threats which, unfortunately, still include terrorism and cross-border crime, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, poverty, inequality, climate change and environmental degradation. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Russia is set to continue to firmly uphold the fundamental principles enshrined in the UN Charter such as sovereignty and equality of states, non-interference in their internal affairs, fair settlement of disputes and of course, the key role of the UN in addressing international problems. Our proposal to hold a summit of states – permanent members of the UN Security Council, which bear special responsibility for maintaining international peace and stability, is in line with this principled approach. Colleagues, The coronavirus pandemic – we will have to talk about this as well, since there is no way around it given the circumstances – has seriously disrupted the usual course of life around the world. Last year – and the [Foreign] Minister just mentioned this – we were unable to even get together for our traditional meeting at the Foreign Ministry with the ambassadors and Russia's permanent representatives. In fact, we began to work in a new environment. But here is what I would like to emphasise. I have spoken about this more than once. Despite the ongoing measures, the pandemic is far from being overcome, and the risks of more waves of the disease coming our way are quite likely, and not a single country will be able to isolate itself from them. So, Russia calls for establishing actual cooperation in fighting this insidious disease on an equal and fair basis. Achieving success and defeating the virus is impossible without this. Recently at the G20 summit, I proposed expediting the mutual recognition of national vaccine certificates and urged our partners to act promptly – you have probably seen this. It is of the essence for reviving global business and tourism activity and, in general, bringing life back to normal. Of course, in this context, the role of the World Health Organisation (WHO) is increasing. Its work should be supported in every way. It could be even more active in mass immunisation, and in particular, could speed up the prequalification of new vaccines and medications, that is, the process for assessing their quality, safety and efficacy. Another growing challenge is climate change. Russia is addressing it, proposing out-of-the-box initiatives. Clean nuclear energy and hydropower, gas power generation, as well as the enormous absorptive capacity of our forests and ecosystems have made our country one of the leaders in the global decarbonisation process. We meet all our commitments under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Recently, a major decision was taken to implement a new programme to improve energy efficiency in the economy by 2035, and this is only the first stage. The programme will be part of a broader plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 at the latest. This does not mean it cannot be achieved earlier – I said, not later. Our diplomacy should be more active in countering attempts by the European Union and the United States to assume the right to dictate the climate agenda single-handedly and to create standards for it, although we saw how difficult discussions in Glasgow were and how many questions they had between themselves. But we are not calling for dissent; on the contrary, we are calling for a search for mutually acceptable solutions. Incidentally, overall we should proceed from the premise that Russia has taken an advanced position in the green transformation and in digitisation in all economic industries and areas of life. Regarding other priorities for the diplomatic service, I would like to mention the need to pay more attention to strengthening ties with our compatriots abroad, protecting their interests and preserving pan-Russian cultural identity, as well as to simplifying the procedures for granting Russian citizenship to them. Yes, I realise that this problem is at the junction of several ministries and departments, but the Foreign Ministry should also deal with this. In general, we should map out the best ways for using the creative potential of the millions of Russians around the world. Obviously, it is necessary to continue creating an atmosphere of friendship, security and cooperation in the post-Soviet space. To achieve this, we need to expand our relations with our partners in the Commonwealth of Independent States, with whom we are bonded by historical, cultural and simply human ties. The Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) is a key integration association. The EAEU goal is to create a common market for goods and services, capital and workforce. Consistent promotion of integration is already producing results for the participating states, driving their economic growth and helping improve the wellbeing of their citizens. We should use such achievements to involve new members and partners in the orbit of this organisation. Considering the risks and challenges arising along the perimeter of our borders, we should pay special attention to joint efforts with our allies in the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO). In the last few decades, the CSTO has seriously contributed to the maintenance of stability in Eurasia. We should steadily promote our cooperation in the CSTO and use it in practice for the reliable protection of the national interests, sovereignty and independence of its members. We should also enhance, through practical actions, our partnership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). This is one of the most influential centres in the multi-polar world, multi-polar international architecture. It is substantially facilitating stability and a sustainable socioeconomic growth in Eurasia. It is in our interests to achieve closer foreign policy coordination between its members, primarily in the UN, and other international venues. Of course, we will develop cooperation in BRICS in the same vein. BRICS brings over 40 percent of the world's population together and occupies more than a quarter of the Earth's land area. BRICS should play a bigger role in international affairs and match the growing potential of its participants. Colleagues, Traditionally, our diplomacy is actively involved in settling regional conflicts. Unfortunately, the number of these conflicts and crisis situations around the world is multiplying, requiring more attention and swift response. Of course, Ukraine's internal crisis is among the most pressing and sensitive issues for us, which has so far remained unresolved. Demonstratively, Ukraine has failed to fulfil its obligations under the Minsk Package of Measures, as well as the Normandy format agreements. In other words, our Normandy Quartet partners – Germany and France – do not dispute the importance of the Minsk agreements. By the way, we must not forget that the Minsk agreements have become a norm of international law since the UN Security Council adopted the relevant resolutions. Unfortunately, in reality, [Germany and France] are indulging the current Kiev leadership's course on dismantling the [Minsk agreements], which, unfortunately, has led the talks and the settlement itself into a dead end. Nonetheless, it is important to energetically continue the mediation efforts in the Contact Group and the Normandy format, since there are no other international mechanisms to promote an internal Ukrainian settlement, and there is no alternative to implementing the Minsk agreements in full. Importantly, our Western partners are exacerbating the situation by supplying Kiev with modern lethal weapons, conducting provocative military exercises in the Black Sea and other regions close to our borders. With regard to the Black Sea, this even goes beyond certain limits since strategic bombers, which carry very serious weapons, fly at a distance of only 20 kilometres from our state border. Indeed, we constantly express our concerns about these matters and talk about red lines, but of course, we understand that our partners are peculiar in the sense that they have a very – how to put it mildly – superficial approach to our warnings about red lines. We remember well NATO's eastward expansion – the audience here is quite representative and professional. Despite the fact that relations between Russia and our Western partners, including the United States, were nothing short of unique, and the level of relations was almost allied, our concerns and warnings regarding NATO's eastward expansion have been totally ignored. There have been several waves of expansion, and let's look at where the military infrastructure of the NATO bloc is now – anti-missile defence systems have been deployed right next to our borders in Romania and Poland. These can easily be put to offensive use with the Mk-41 launchers there; replacing the software takes only minutes. Nevertheless, our recent warnings have had a certain effect: tensions have arisen there anyway. In this regard, I have two points to make. First, it is important for them to remain in this state for as long as possible, so that it does not occur to them to stage some kind of conflict on our western borders which we do not need, we do not need a new conflict. Second, Mr Lavrov, it is imperative to push for serious long-term guarantees that ensure Russia's security in this area, because Russia cannot constantly be thinking about what could happen there tomorrow. Clearly, and I can see this despite the fact that many people are wearing face masks, but I can tell by their eyes that there are sceptical smiles with regard to whether we can count on and hope for serious agreements in this area, keeping in mind that, after all, we are dealing with, to put it mildly, not very reliable partners who can easily backtrack on any previous agreement. Nevertheless, as difficult as it may be, we need to work on this, and I want you to keep that in mind. It is also impossible to ignore that Western countries are using the migration crisis on Belarus-Poland border as a new reason for tension in a region close to us, for putting pressure on Minsk, while at the same time forgetting their own humanitarian commitments. Just look how the Polish security forces are behaving at the border – you can watch it on the internet or on television. The first thing that comes to mind is those poor children, there are small children there. And they are shooting water and tear gas at the crowd, throwing grenades. At night, helicopters fly along the border, sirens are howling. I remember well how in 2014, when the Polish government, trying to stop the use of similar equipment by law enforcement forces in Ukraine – [Viktor] Yanukovych was President then – how they said it was unacceptable to use such means against the civilian population. What are they doing now? Indeed, we know and understand that Belarus has its problems, although domestic political tensions have calmed down, but the problems exist, and yes, we are well aware of this and we certainly support a dialogue between the authorities and the opposition. But Russia, for its part, will undoubtedly continue its policy of strengthening ties and deepening integration with Belarus. We are determined to implement all 28 recently adopted Union State industry programmes to develop a common economic space, and go on to pursue coordinated macroeconomic, tax, banking and credit policies. A year ago, Russia's vigorous mediation efforts helped curb the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, but the recent shootings on the Armenian-Azerbaijani border have shown that the region has not yet fully stabilised. The efforts of the Russian peacekeeping contingent, as a guarantor of the ceasefire and the civilian population's security, are essential to ensure stability. Undoubtedly, Russian diplomacy is playing a growing role in further efforts to settle disputes between Azerbaijan and Armenia, restore economic ties and unblock vital transport corridors in the South Caucasus. We have established an interstate commission at the level of deputy prime ministers. It is working, and I think it has good prospects. All countries of the region, including Russia, are interested in the long-term resolution of these problems. There are serious challenges with respect to Afghanistan, especially after the US withdrawal from that country. In further contacts with the Taliban, it is necessary to make more active use of the formats of the Moscow consultations and the consultations of the extended ""Troika"" with the participation of external players and neighbours of Afghanistan with a view to promoting civil peace and public order, neutralising terrorist structures and drug crime. Developments in Afghanistan dictate the need for additional measures to ensure Russia's security on its southern borders and provide assistance to our allies – Central Asian states that consider Russia to be a guarantor of regional stability. It is necessary to continue acting in this vein, taking measures to prevent uncontrollable refugee flows and stop terrorists and other criminals from crossing our border. Colleagues, We have repeatedly noted the centre of gravity of the world's politics and economy steadily shift from the Euro-Atlantic to the Asia-Pacific. So, we should continue vigorously developing relations with the states of the Asia-Pacific Region, being guided by our ambitious initiative to create the Greater Eurasian Partnership as a common, broad and open space of security, mutually beneficial economic and humanitarian cooperation. We will continue strengthening ties with our good neighbours and friends in the People's Republic of China. Our bilateral ties have now reached the highest level in history and amount to a comprehensive strategic partnership. It is possible to say that they are a model for effective interstate cooperation in the 21st century. Naturally, this is not to the liking of everyone. Some of our Western partners are openly trying to drive a wedge between Moscow and Beijing. We are well aware of this. Together with our Chinese friends, we will continue responding to such attempts by expanding our political, economic and other cooperation, and coordinating steps in the world arena. Russia has a similar approach in relations with India, our specially privileged strategic partner. We intend to build up our truly multifaceted bilateral cooperation. We regard India as an independent, strong centre of the multipolar world. We have a similar foreign policy philosophy and priorities. Cooperation between Russia and ASEAN contributes to maintaining stability and security, as well as ensures sustainable development in the Asia-Pacific. It is important to deepen and improve, in every possible way, the experience we have accumulated over 30 years of productive political, economic and social cooperation with ASEAN. It is equally important to maintain the intensive work with our partners in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, consistently implementing existing initiatives for post-pandemic economic recovery, stimulating trade in goods and services, investment and technological exchange, and expanding humanitarian contacts. Russia has always acted and will continue to act as an impartial mediator to resolve conflicts and crises in the Middle East and help stabilise that region in every possible way. Our direct involvement contributed to defeating international terrorism in Syria, preventing the country from disintegrating, and to launching the intra-Syrian settlement process under the auspices of the UN, as part of the Astana format with Turkey and Iran. Russian diplomacy should continue to contribute to the normalisation of relations between Syria and the Arab countries and an early return to the League of Arab States, as well as to enlist international assistance to improve the humanitarian situation in that country. Assisting in the advancement of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process is of fundamental importance for the improvement of the situation in the Middle East. We need to continue balanced and purposeful work with all parties to the Libyan conflict, to direct them towards finding a compromise. Overall, forging a truly friendly, pragmatic and non-ideology based dialogue with all states in the Middle East remains our unconditional priority. Russia intends to continue to focus on cooperating with the African states, building comprehensive and mutually beneficial ties. By the way, this was the purpose of a recent decision to strengthen the staff of the Africa Department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. As you know, in 2019, Sochi hosted the first Russia-Africa summit; the parties are exploring the possibility of holding the next meeting in 2022. With regard to Latin American and Caribbean countries, this region has always been interested in cooperating with Russia, and interest is growing, especially in the wake of our major supplies of vaccines and medicines to combat the coronavirus. We have formed a circle of countries on the continent that we traditionally maintain good and close relations with, and this circle is expanding, so we need to keep this process going. Regarding European affairs, I have to state with regret that the opportunities for cooperation continue to narrow. Even though the EU remains our leading trade and economic partner, the previously rather productive Russia-EU cooperation is currently experiencing major difficulties. The EU continues to push us back with its sanctions, unfriendly actions and unfounded accusations while ignoring the obvious benefits of interaction in politics, the economy and culture. We must not forget that we are neighbours and, as we know from history, dividing lines on the continent have never led to anything good. Of course, Russia is interested in maintaining neighbourly and constructive ties with the European countries, but everything depends on our partners' willingness to establish and maintain equal and respectful cooperation. A similar, if not more depressing, situation prevails in our relations with NATO which has adopted a markedly confrontational stance and is stubbornly and demonstratively bringing its military infrastructure closer to our borders, as I mentioned earlier. Moreover, NATO was the one that broke our dialogue mechanisms. Of course, we will provide a proper response to NATO's military activity along Russia's borders, but, most importantly, Brussels must understand that alleviating military-political tensions is not only in Russia's interest, but also in the interest of Europe and the world in general. Out of the blue, they expelled our diplomats without providing any reason for doing so, and then they take offence at us closing their [diplomatic] mission in Russia. Why take offence? This was their initiative. They did it with their own hands and then started looking for someone to blame. Well, if they do not want to cooperate with us, okay, don't, it is not that we are desperate to cooperate with them. I think they will want to, they are already sending signals that they want to cooperate, but why did they expel our diplomats just like that, out of the blue, for no reason? Is it some kind of sport for them? This also applies, by the way, to Russia-US relations, which, as you know, largely underlie global security and stability. At this point, these relations, to put it mildly, are in an unsatisfactory state. The diplomats from both countries are experiencing major problems. Embassy staffs have been cut and the embassies cannot function properly, let alone systematically engage in expanding bilateral ties. These are the consequences of the provocative policy pursued by US authorities, which began to practice large-scale bans and restrictions for Russian diplomats five years ago. Our property in the United Sates has been seized in violation of every international standard and rule, every single rule. They have grossly violated the rules, just took our property and that was that – where is the Vienna Convention now? They even refuse to talk to us about it. Isn't this strange, in the seemingly civilised world we live in? Or it is not so civilised after all. Nevertheless, the summit with President Biden in Geneva last June opened up a few opportunities for a dialogue and gradual alignment, straightening out our relations, and it is important that both sides consistently expand the agreements reached. Indeed, something is already being done, this much must be admitted: joint work has begun on the strategic stability and information security agenda. True, our interests, assessments, and positions on many bilateral and international issues differ – this is indeed so and everyone is well aware of it – sometimes the difference is dramatic. However, I would like to say this again, we are open to contact and an exchange of views, to a constructive dialogue. Colleagues, The points that I made here show that the diplomatic service is definitely shouldering a heavy burden, which is constantly increasing. You have to work under very difficult and challenging conditions. The state will continue to heed any pressing problems with diplomatic service employees, and to strengthen their social guarantees. We have made a few steps towards this in the past few years. Two basic laws have been adopted – on the diplomatic service and on the status of Russian ambassadors and permanent representatives in foreign states. A new remuneration system has been introduced, which increased the incomes of employees at the Foreign Ministry headquarters. The headquarters was slightly upsized, and the Foreign Ministry's proposals on expanding Russia's diplomatic and consular presence in a number of CIS countries have been approved, too. We will continue to keep all these matters under review, and to support useful initiatives from the top Ministry officials. To conclude my remarks, I would like to thank all the employees of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for their high-quality and dedicated work, and to wish them every success. Taking this opportunity, I would like to again express my special gratitude to the diplomatic service veterans, who could not join us in this room today for obvious reasons, and I would ask you to convey to them my best wishes of good health and happiness. Thank you for your attention."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67119,Meeting on developing genetic technologies,2021-11-17T16:00:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region","The President held a meeting, via videoconference, on the development of genetic technologies in the Russian Federation.","The meeting participants discussed the implementation of the Federal Scientific and Technical Programme for the Development of Genetic Technologies until 2027 and issues related to human resources, logistics and technical support for research, as well as measures to involve the real economy in the development of genetic technologies in agriculture, medicine, and industrial microbiology. Taking part in the meeting were Deputy Chairman of the Security Council Dmitry Medvedev, deputy prime ministers Tatyana Golikova and Dmitry Chernyshenko, Presidential Aide Andrei Fursenko, Minister of Healthcare Mikhail Murashko, Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov, Minister of Agriculture Dmitry Patrushev, Minister of Science and Higher Education Valery Falkov, First Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Vasily Osmakov, Head of the Federal Service for the Oversight of Consumer Protection and Welfare (Rospotrebnadzor) – Chief State Sanitary Doctor Anna Popova, as well as heads of research institutions and business leaders. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, good afternoon. Two years ago, we launched a special programme to develop genetic technologies. Today, I suggest that we review its progress, along with the challenges that have emerged, so that this conversation leads to new decisions that will enable us to move forward even faster. We need to take into consideration that genetic research is rapidly developing around the world. I am referring to fundamental research, as well as the development of cutting-edge production facilities and entire economic sectors that are related to genetics. I propose starting with the legal framework for genome studies and the use of genetic technolgies. As in all other fields of research that are on the cutting edge, humankind so far has been breaking new ground, there are many challenging, controversial issues from both a legal, and a human perspective. You may have noticed that I mentioned this just a few days ago during the conference on artificial intelligence. It is absolutely clear that legislation regulating genetics must open up wide possibilities for scientific research and innovation in human medicine, veterinary science, breeding and other fields. At the same time, it is necessary to clearly define the boundaries of acceptable use of genetic technologies. This is not only an issue of modern legal regulation but an ethical issue as well. These boundaries must be clearly set and recognised by scientists and businesses – and, crucially, accepted by society and trusted by the public. Obviously, the issue of genetic information is extremely important. It is of primary importance that legislative mechanisms are developed that protect the rights of citizens and regulate the collection, use and protection of the genetic data of individuals and their families, including future offspring. Specialists will understand what I mean. I want to stress that all decisions in this area must be carefully thought through, in a close dialogue with the scientific and professional community. This concerns building an integrated and unified storage system for genetic material and samples. This work is already in progress as part of implementing the law on biosecurity. Based on the experience gained, we need to develop a modern regulatory environment for all forms of biological material collection. I think it is also important to comprehensively describe the operation of the National Database of Genetic Information and national biological resource centres, one of which will be established at the Vavilov National Institute of Plant Industry. I would like to emphasise that both Nikolai Vavilov and other prominent scientists and plant breeders dedicated their entire lives to preserving endemic Russian species and, in particular, the plants that have strategic and key significance for our food security. I am talking about wheat and other crops, of course. I believe that when it comes to genetic samples of particularly valuable plants, there must be special handling regulations in place. I will sign an Executive Order to this effect at the earliest opportunity. Colleagues, All our scientific and technological projects should aim at achieving the national development goals that we have set for the current decade. This is why it is extremely important to focus all the priorities around people, improving the welfare of the people, and synchronise our efforts regarding deadlines, resources, and the measures we implement. The scientific and technical programme in agriculture has been extended; we have extended these plans until 2030. I suggest we make the same decision regarding the programme for the development of genetic technologies, ensuring the proper funding for the ambitious results that we need in this area. At the same time, I understand very well that, of course, scientists are often and perhaps most interested in, for example, decoding the genome, breeding a new plant variety or conducting significant experiments, which would be a tremendous success for them. However, unique discoveries should not remain just a scientific breakthrough: they must serve people. I already said at the beginning that genetic technologies today are the basis for advanced solutions in many sectors of the economy and for the rapid development of new industries. You know this very well, colleagues. I mean the production of effective medicines, eco-friendly foods, as well as industrial technology, such as air and soil purification, environmental protection and, finally, ample opportunities for climate projects and the utilisation of carbon emissions. To make scientific achievements improve the quality of people's life, it is necessary to expand the involvement of our companies and businesses in the genetic technologies programme. I suggest we think about new ways to encourage the development of the cooperation tools we already have. We agreed at the very beginning to encourage the work of our strategic partners in the development of the key scientific and technological spheres. In this connection, it would be interesting to listen to the proposals regarding support mechanisms for genetic projects, which Rosneft, one of our largest companies, is launching. Of course, I would also like Mr Igor Sechin[Rosneft CEO] to tell us the details of the company's current results and plans in this area, which is absolutely new for Rosneft, including the establishment of a competence centre and a programme to train advanced genetic science specialists jointly with Moscow State University. In general, I suggest that today we hold an in-depth discussion on the training of personnel and support measures for young research teams. Next, we should seriously strengthen partnership between enterprises in the real economy and world-class human genome research centres. They are working with research institutes and universities across the country to implement projects in the interests of medicine, agriculture and biosecurity. Today I would like representatives from these centres to tell us about cooperation between scientists and high-tech companies, what additional measures should be taken to encourage businesses to take a more active part in research projects, including at the early stages of research. Another important topic concerns equipment for genetic research. The demand for it at our research, medical and diagnostic laboratories is constantly growing. In light of this, I believe it is necessary to support investment projects for the creation of domestically-made genetic research equipment and supplies, and, colleagues, I expect practical proposals from you regarding this. Let us get down to discussing all these issues. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67118,Address to participants in the Second Russia-Uzbekistan Interregional Cooperation Forum,2021-11-17T15:20:00Z,NA,,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, I am delighted to welcome the participants in the Second Russia-Uzbekistan Interregional Cooperation Forum. I believe in the importance of this bilateral framework and its relevance not only for promoting region-to-region ties between the Russian Federation and Uzbekistan, but also for strengthening our strategic partnership, which stands out for its intensity and vibrancy, and is truly multifaceted. Russia is one of Uzbekistan's leading trading partners, ranking second in its foreign trade. Even during the pandemic, our economic ties continued to expand. In 2020, trade increased by 16 percent almost reaching US$6 billion, and in the first nine months of 2021 it grew by more than 6 percent. This is largely attributable to region-to-region cooperation. Russian regions that are proactive in maintaining economic ties with their partners in Uzbekistan include Moscow, St Petersburg, Tatarstan, as well as the Chelyabinsk, Moscow, Ivanovo and Samara regions. The construction of the Tashkent Metallurgical Plant and the Kandym Gas Processing Complex, as well as the launch in Uzbekistan of harvester production with Rostselmash's participation are all examples of mutually beneficial cooperation in recent years. Russia is one of the main investors in Uzbekistan's economy with over 150 joint projects currently underway worth over US$14 billion. The number of ventures with Russian capital increased 2.5 times over the past four years to exceed 2,000 entities. Let me note, in particular, the INNOPROM. Big Industrial Week in Uzbekistan exhibition. It took place in April 2021 with the participation of 13 Russian regions and resulted in the signing of 21 agreements worth some US$130 million. Of course, we welcome the interest expressed by our friends in Uzbekistan in stepping up their ties with their Russian partners, which is demonstrated by the fact that over the past two months delegations from Uzbekistan visited 20 Russian regions. This kind of cooperation has far from depleted its potential. There are many opportunities for undertaking new direct cooperation projects, creating value chains in manufacturing, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and innovative technology. By playing a more proactive role within the Eurasian Economic Union our partners in Uzbekistan could further strengthen our cooperation. In late 2020, Uzbekistan became an observer in our integration structure, and we are certain that this will benefit Uzbekistan and all EAEU member states. Of course, region-to-region ties are not just about the economy or trade. We have built a solid record of accomplishments in working together on protecting the environment, water resources and forests, as well as biodiversity and conservation areas. We are carrying out joint projects for addressing the urgent environmental problems of the Aral Sea and facilitating socioeconomic development in the entire Aral Sea region. Russia and Uzbekistan are proactive in promoting their humanitarian ties, as well as stepping up their academic, educational and youth exchanges. The Second Russia-Uzbekistan Educational Forum, currently taking place at Lomonosov Moscow State University, will discuss these and many other important matters. By the way, Russian universities have 14 branches and representative offices in Uzbekistan. This number will increase to 16 next year. St Petersburg State University will open its branch in Tashkent. A number of other projects to improve Russian language teaching in Uzbekistan's kindergartens and schools are underway. To conclude, I strongly believe that the Regional Forum will make a tangible contribution to further promoting the strategic partnership and allied relations between Russia and Uzbekistan and strengthen our neighbourly and mutually beneficial ties for the benefit of our peoples. I would like to thank the organisers and all the participants in this forum and wish them every success. Thank you for your attention."

Both sides expressed the resolve to continue coordinating their efforts towards a settlement in Syria, including within the framework of the Astana format. Attention was also given to the situation around the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action(JCPOA) on Iran's nuclear programme. Russia and Iran are advocating its comprehensive implementation within the initially coordinated framework. Vladimir Putin expressed hope that the talks on this issue, which are scheduled to take place in Vienna in late December, would be constructive. During the exchange of views on the situation in Afghanistan, the two leaders pointed out their readiness to promote the establishment of peace and stability there. The President of Russia told his counterpart about the upcoming delivery of Russian humanitarian aid– food and essential goods to Kabul. Another issue on the agenda concerned Nagorno-Karabakh. Vladimir Putin spoke about Russia's measures to ensure the ceasefire, unblock economic and transport links and establish peaceful life in the region. It has been agreed to continue contacts at various levels."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67111,Meeting with Aeroflot CEO Mikhail Poluboyarinov,2021-11-16T13:05:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",The President held a working meeting with Aeroflot CEO Mikhail Poluboyarinov.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Poluboyarinov, overcoming the economic challenges created by the pandemic is still on our agenda. The transport industry has suffered the most, and air travel was its worst-affected sector. Aeroflot is Russia's largest carrier. I know that it is gradually recovering, at least passenger traffic on domestic flights has increased compared to the previous year. However, overall passenger traffic is lower than it was pre-pandemic, in 2019. What is the situation today? Aeroflot CEO Mikhail Poluboyarinov: You are quite right, Mr President. I have prepared a brief presentation, and if you will allow me, I would like to show you a few slides to brief you on the latest developments. You were right to note that globally the sector is still struggling. In 2020, passenger traffic dropped by 60 percent, and in the first seven months of 2021 the decline was 47 percent. Analysts do not expect the global market to recover before 2024. In Russia, air travel has suffered less. We have yet to overcome the crisis, but the situation is much better. In January-July 2021, we recovered almost 70 percent of our traffic. Moreover, domestic flights demonstrated an 18 percent increase above the pre-pandemic level. Accordingly, we can say that global recovery has been slow, but the Russian market has been leading in promoting recovery in its domestic air service. Still, we do not expect to reach pre-pandemic levels before 2023. Vladimir Putin: Are you referring to domestic flights? Mikhail Poluboyarinov: Yes, but domestic flights include both international destinations, and flights within Russia. Speaking of Aeroflot's market standing against this backdrop, we see that passenger traffic is recovering along with the Russian market. By August 2021, we almost reached pre-pandemic levels with only 11 percent to go. Of course, it was the fast recovery of domestic traffic that drove this growth. If we look at domestic air services, we can see that in the summer of 2021 our group exceeded the 2019 indicators by 30 percent. Aeroflot has been able to deliver this result thanks to a new route network. We never had anything like this before. Only the Soviet Union had a route network of this kind. The gist of the new approach is that instead of relying on Sheremetyevo as our single hub, we place more emphasis on all the major regional airports. This way, people can travel to the Black Sea coast, where so many of us love to spend our holidays, bypassing Moscow. This is a convenient solution, and we intend to keep moving in this direction. As for international air services, there has been some recovery, even if it has been on the slow side: we are still 62 percent below the previous year. As for the impact all these developments have had on our financial performance, 2020 was extremely challenging for us. We reported a loss of 123 billion rubles. Overall, thanks to targeted and timely government support, we were able to meet all our financial obligations, and, most importantly, to retain our unique team. As for 2021, we are doing everything to minimise losses and cover as many financial needs as we can on our own, without asking the state to step in. For example, we almost broke even in the second quarter of 2021, which nearly doubled our financial indicators for the first six months of 2021. We did report a loss of 27 billion because international air services had yet to recover at the time, but this was still better than the year before when we had a loss of 58 billion. As a matter of fact, the market has praised our efforts: since the last share issue last year our shares have added 12 percent, and we received a high credit rating that is just one point below the sovereign rating. I would like to say a few words about our strategy. Despite the pandemic-related slump, Aeroflot is accomplishing all the tasks of the strategy that you have approved. I would like to briefly recall the main provisions of the strategy until 2028. Aeroflot should become a global premium-class flag carrier, prioritising high-profit and medium-range flights from Moscow and also long-haul flights. Pobeda is a low-cost carrier offering low prices and focusing on the rapid growth of the market's mass segment. Rossiya Co. is our centre of competences for effectively operating Russian-made aircraft, and its chain focuses on flights bypassing Moscow. I would like to report that we have implemented all of the strategy's plans, conceived by us for 2020 and 2021. In brief, we have launched a joint route network of our three air carriers from Sheremetyevo, we have given over 50 Aeroflot aircraft to Rossiya and Pobeda, and we have launched a new regional hub in Krasnoyarsk, and this hub has proved to be quite successful. We now operate flights from the new modern B and C terminals at Sheremetyevo, and we have set up a centre of competences for operating Russian technology at Rossiya Co. Vladimir Putin: How does this hub function in Krasnoyarsk and what do you think about its prospects? Mikhail Poluboyarinov: To be honest, we did not even expect this to happen because all historical trends were disrupted during the pandemic, and we have launched the hub little by little since the summer. Our first routes linked Krasnoyarsk with Sochi, Simferopol and Blagoveshchensk. People were quite eager to buy tickets because they liked direct flights and because they also liked to deal with Aeroflot. Passenger traffic volumes soared at a breathtaking pace. Therefore, we are now planning to operate Airbus A320 airliners from there. Vladimir Putin: In his time, Governor Lebed promoted the idea of the Krasnoyarsk hub. Mikhail Poluboyarinov: Indeed, that was a very correct idea and the right choice. Mr President, in this connection, I cannot help but note and, maybe, even boast a little that, despite the complex situation in our sector, Aeroflot has not wavered in its achievements and it guarantees high punctuality and high-quality services to its passengers. Even in August 2021, we took first place in the world for punctuality, despite unprecedented air traffic volumes. Our stable and high customer satisfaction index exceeds that of such companies as Air France, Delta, KLM and Lufthansa. In effect, we are outpacing them. Of course, our clients remain loyal, because of our consistent approach towards punctuality and service standards. If I may, I will briefly dwell on our main growth driver as well as the driver of price reductions, Pobeda Airlines. There is no other airline today, in the world or in Russia, that would have performed so well, even closing 2020, the most difficult year, with a profit of 1.5 billion rubles. We expect the company to carry over 14.5 million passengers in 2021. I would like to note that, as we have planned in our strategy, we will cut prices by up to 30 percent for destinations that Pobeda Airlines serves. It is not just a plan– it is a reality, which includes joint flights operated by Aeroflot and Pobeda. Undoubtedly, we can note Pobeda's big contribution to increasing mobility. At least 13 percent of customers have been able to afford to fly for the first time in their lives, and 30 percent of the destinations served are unique. Therefore, I believe it is important that, thanks to the launch of the Pobeda low-cost airline, Aeroflot Group has offers for passengers in all price segments. A few words about our company Rossiya Airlines. It is growing as a centre of excellence and effective operation of domestic aircraft. The chosen strategy proved correct, as we observed an increase in efficiency and in the health of the aircraft fleet. Thus, Sukhoi Superjet has reached 75 percent serviceability in 2021. This has never happened before. In July 2021, growth in Sukhoi fleet's flight hours at Rossiya Airlines exceeded the July 2019 level by 27 percent. Despite the problems that the aviation industry is struggling with, we continue to fulfil our obligations to our partners. At the end of 2021, Rossiya Airlines fleet will have 66 Sukhoi Superjets; next year we expect to have the first four MC-21s, and, as planned, in 2028, we should have 150 Superjets and 85 MC-21s. Vladimir Putin: You have 350 aircraft in your entire fleet, do you not? Mikhail Poluboyarinov: Now there are 352. In 2028, we will have 235. This will account for nearly half of the entire fleet in 2028. Vladimir Putin: 235 Russian-made jets? Mikhail Poluboyarinov: Yes, domestic production. Mr President, I would like to say that all the measures taken have enabled us to maintain the group's economic efficiency, and also to fulfil our social obligations. Our own flat rates programme that you supported continues to evolve. In 2021, we have already surpassed our 2019 level: we will transport 2.5 million passengers, including 1.3 million to the Far East. This is more than in 2019, when we transported 2.3 million. Therefore, I can say that we can see great support for this programme from the population. And we ask you, Mr President, to support Aeroflot's proposal for the further development and implementation of this programme in 2022. <…>"

It is vitally important that our joint work in this field is carried out actively and effectively despite the pandemic-related restrictions. In particular, the network of Russian university branches in Uzbekistan is expanding: there are already fourteen and the opening of the fifteenth– a branch of St Petersburg State University– is underway in Tashkent. The number of Uzbekistani students in Russia is growing constantly and has exceeded 43,000 this year. It is important that the agenda of your forum includes the most topical issues the Russian and Uzbekistani partners are facing in education, such as cooperation between universities, advanced training of secondary school teachers, as well as improving children's preschool education, including language education. I am sure that you will have constructive and substantive discussions, and your ideas and initiatives will enjoy recognition and demand, and serve to further strengthen friendly ties between our nations."""
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67109,Telephone conversation with President of France Emmanuel Macron,2021-11-15T21:30:00Z,NA,Vladimir Putin had an extended telephone conversation with President of the French Republic Emmanuel Macron.,"Many urgent issues on the bilateral and international agenda, including efforts to combat the coronavirus, were discussed during the conversation. The leaders expressed satisfaction with the latest meeting of the Russian-French Security Cooperation Council held in Paris on November 12, 2021, with the participation of the foreign and defence ministers of the two countries. The presidents spoke in support of continuing the dialogue on military-political matters and other important issues. The situation at the border of Belarus with EU countries was reviewed. The President of Russia emphasised the extremely rough treatment of refugees by Polish border guards. Having informed President Macron of his contacts on the migration crisis with President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko, Vladimir Putin said it would be expedient for the leaders of the EU and Belarus to discuss the problems directly. Dissatisfaction with the lack of progress in settling the domestic conflict in Ukraine was expressed on both sides, and it was noted that developments around Donbass are also moving in the wrong direction. In this context, Vladimir Putin drew President Macron's attention to the provocative nature of the large-scale exercises conducted by the US and its allies in the Black Sea, worsening tensions between Russia and NATO. The President of Russia also underscored that Kiev has continued its destructive policy of sabotaging the Minsk agreements. This is borne out by the fact that the armed forces of Ukraine recently used strike drones in the conflict zone. The status of the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement process was reviewed as well. Vladimir Putin noted that Russia will continue making steps to facilitate stabilisation and the consistent implementation of the tripartite agreements reached with Russia's mediation. The presidents of Russia and France noted the success of the Paris international conference on Libya. They emphasised the importance of maintaining positive momentum in the settlement process and continuing to work diligently with the Libyan parties, proceeding from decisions that have already been reached, including at this forum. The situation in Mali was also raised by Emmanuel Macron. The leaders agreed to continue their regular one-on-one conversations in the future."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67107,Meeting with Russian Highways CEO Vyacheslav Petushenko,2021-11-15T13:15:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with Russian Highways State Company CEO Vyacheslav Petushenko to discuss the company's current performance and the situation in the road sector.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon. Mr Petushenko, the company was established in 2009, and it has accomplished a lot since then. Today, the corporate contract portfolio exceeds one trillion rubles. To the best of my knowledge, private investment accounts for 25 percent of these resources. State Company Management Board Chair Vyacheslav Petushenko: Yes, this is extra-budgetary funding. Vladimir Putin: I would like to ask you to assess the situation in the road sector, to single out high-priority facilities and important short-term goals. Vyacheslav Petushenko: Yes, indeed, we started with the Moscow-Krasnodar Motorway, and we have completed it. We resurfaced a 1,500-km section, and this is now a high-speed road. Mr President, I believe that construction of the Moscow-St Petersburg Motorway is the main achievement and the first significant success not only for our company but also for the national road construction sector. We built this 606-plus-kilometre road, and it opened to traffic two years ago. Today, there are no single-level intersections. We have to complete a short section bypassing Tver, and we are planning to do this by late 2023, no matter what. Consequently, the Russian Federation will receive the first route linking both capitals. By the way, we have eliminated all the local bottlenecks, and current speeds are 130 kph. Present-day allowances considered, it is now possible to drive from Moscow to St Petersburg in just five hours. The М-4 Motorway to Krasnodar, the Moscow-St Petersburg Road, and the Central Ring Road project, which we have finally completed, now allow us to create a North-South axis from St Petersburg to the Black Sea, given that our colleagues are to build a motorway from Krasnodar to the Kerch Bridge. I think that by 2024 we will be able to drive from St Petersburg to Sevastopol without stopping at a single traffic light and without having any single-level intersections. Currently, we are working hard on the construction of bypasses around Rostov and Krasnodar and then we will drive the 2,500 kilometres[from St Petersburg to Sevastopol] without a hitch. The Central Ring Road is a meaningful project, Mr President. Like any other project carried out now, it is live and requires development and we can see that we have to remove some bottlenecks there. And the main thing that we are working on now, Mr President: when we commissioned the М-11 Motorway, we said that we would begin the М-12 Motorway, Moscow– Nizhny Novgorod– Kazan. The start was signalled last July; 800 kilometres. At present, we are practically working on each kilometre. We have started building 75 engineering structures and we keep on working. There are three very large projects there: bridges across the Volga, the Oka and the Sura. And the pace that we have reached now and the financial support mean that we can be sure of completing the work and that we will be off in 2024. Vladimir Putin: How is your situation with labour resources? Vyacheslav Petushenko: This is one of the most complex issues to date. We understand that we need up to 20,000 people. One of the sections is being built by our colleagues from China; however, the labour force issue is a difficult one. Our work requires high skills, the machinery is very complex. Although formerly we needed unskilled workers, we hardly need them now, so the labour force problem still exists. However, major enterprises, the most powerful ones in our sector, which have the engineering and technical personnel, are working with us. As for the workers, I think we will be able to solve all the current problems. Vladimir Putin: You know, in the construction sector– including road construction– we make decisions related to debureaucratisation in a broad sense, that is, excessive regulation and the outdated statutory framework. How do you assess the situation from this point of view? Vyacheslav Petushenko: I recalled this when the Central Ring Road was launched– I also built and opened the ring road around St Petersburg ten years ago– and I compared these two cases from the point of view of decision making. I can say, Mr President, that in the past two years a lot has been done. The importance of major projects such the Central Ring Road or the Moscow-Nizhny Novgorod-Kazan Motorway shows that we will not achieve anything if we do not speed up the process. The current""regulatory guillotine"" helps to debureaucratise many issues because the launch of road construction is a difficult period and requires a boost in the beginning. Vladimir Putin: You said that a lot has been done. Is it enough? Vyacheslav Petushenko: No, I do not think it is quite enough; there is still much left to do. Vladimir Putin: Exactly, please work on it. The bureaucratic part of the system, the statutory framework even within the company, needs to be addressed carefully. Of course, the cost is one of the most crucial issues. Vyacheslav Petushenko: Yes, I agree. Vladimir Putin: We are witnessing inflation processes. Global inflation is on the rise, and construction has gotten more expensive all over the world. Naturally, it affects us too, but we still need to do everything in our power to minimise these costs and prevent an unreasonable increase. Do you feel the Government and the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service paying attention to your work? Vyacheslav Petushenko: I can say that in the past few years… You know, we are even breaking some older stereotypes when we sometimes did not even bother to think why we were making such decisions. But new equipment and new approaches… Most importantly, we have to build more per every ruble invested, to put it bluntly. We have to use as many of our resources as possible in order to streamline various decisions. Regarding the Moscow-Nizhny Novgorod-Kazan route, we eliminated very many excessive engineering solutions that had existed in the past. We reduced the height of motorway embankments that was calculated in line with projected snowfall levels of the 1930s. Today, we operate magnificent snow removal equipment, we have reduced the volumes and cost of works, and we have removed many engineering structures, which allows us to accomplish more, while spending less. We can see that the Government is also actively involved in this process because we have established working groups with Glavgosekspertiza[Main Directorate of State Examination]. We discuss engineering solutions with industry experts, and it is, indeed, necessary to eliminate existing stereotypes. Mr President, the construction sector community is ready for this, and we can see that we implement very many engineering solutions being suggested to us by builders and designers. Vladimir Putin: And, of course, it is also necessary to work with subcontractors. Vyacheslav Petushenko: It is. We do not have very many major enterprises among our subcontractors, and they are our flagships. Of course, second- and third-level subcontractors are doing a lot. As a rule, they have a narrow field of responsibility. Our large enterprises are multipurpose companies, and enterprises with a narrow specialisation are usually small. When they get involved, they offer solutions facilitating our work. Vladimir Putin: Good. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67105,Address to the finalists of the Bolshaya Peremena contest,2021-11-13T19:20:00Z,NA,,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, I am delighted to welcome you to Artek, which for the second time in a row gives a warm and hospitable welcome to the finalists of the Bolshaya Peremena nationwide contest. I sincerely congratulate the contest winners. You have shown what you are capable of, your talents, your best character traits, and coped with all the assignments admirably. Well done! And I certainly congratulate all the finalists: you have also achieved great results. Some of you lacked just a little bit to achieve victory but it will make fighting for it next year even more exciting. You have honourably traversed the way to the summit. I have no doubt each of you realises that Bolshaya Peremena is much more than a contest: it is a closely-knit team which unites hundreds of thousands of young people across the country, a true community of like-minded people which appreciates everyone, helps to believe in yourself and your energies and to find your way in life. Bolshaya Peremena is also making progress, including thanks to your ideas and suggestions. Thus, new tracks appear in the contest, regional teams are being set up, while earlier this year The Good Saturday volunteer campaign was launched. It is great that you can take part in an interesting and much needed effort and also be its co-authors. You obviously gain your victories independently. However, I think you always feel the support of your parents, tutors, instructors and classmates. They are also part of the Bolshaya Peremena community alongside you. I want to thank them for their interested and emphatic involvement. Friends, You now have every opportunity to succeed in any profession you choose, to fully display and realise your abilities.

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67100,Interview with Rossiya TV channel,2021-11-13T11:15:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow","The President answered questions from Pavel Zarubin, a journalist with Rossiya 1 TV channel.","Pavel Zarubin: Mr President, tensions are escalating on the border between the EU and Belarus. The European Union has already deployed army troops. Moreover, they are building up the contingent. You spoke with Angela Merkel twice, and you also spoke with Alexander Lukashenko. Why they do not speak to each other directly is probably also a question I would like to ask you. In general, what do you think of the developments there? President of Russia Vladimir Putin: To begin with, why they do not speak with each other is not a question for me. We have nothing to do with that. But I inferred from my conversations with President Lukashenko and Chancellor Merkel that they are ready to speak with one another. I hope it will happen soon and some sort of direct contact will be established between the European Union, the EU leading nations, or at least between the Federal Republic of Germany and Belarus. This is crucial because the migrants' goal is primarily to get into Germany. In this connection, I would like to remind you what our Foreign Ministry has already stated. We should not forget the roots of these migration crises. Was it Belarus that unleashed these problems? No, the problems were caused by the West, by the European countries. These problems have political, military and economic dimensions. Military because everyone participated in the Iraq operations, and now there are many Kurds from Iraq[among the migrants]; they had also fought in Afghanistan for twenty years, thus there are more and more Afghans there. Belarus has nothing to do with that. The migrants were also moving via different routes. And it is not surprising that they are now going through Belarus because, as Mr Lukashenko told me, Belarus has visa-free arrangements with the countries of origin. First come military and political causes, but there are also economic factors: there are very high social benefits for migrants in Europe, very high indeed. Say, given high unemployment, a good worker in the Middle East, including in oil producing countries, even if he is employed in the oil industry, earns a fraction of the social benefits that non-working migrants get, for example, in the Federal Republic of Germany. It is natural that people are heading there. Why should they work in turbulent conditions when basic safety rules are not observed when they can live idly with their families and get twice or three times as much? Because these benefits cover both adults and children, free education and, as a rule, free medical care. Let me reiterate, this is the policy of Europe's leading nations. On the other hand, however, we kept hearing that humanitarian issues must be given top priority. However, when Polish border guards and army troops on the Belarus-Poland border beat up potential migrants and fire combat weapons over their heads, blast sirens and spotlights onto their camps at night, where there are children and women in the final weeks of pregnancy, all that does not go well with the ideas of humanism which supposedly underlie all policies of our Western neighbours. Nevertheless, I still proceed from the premise that a solution must be found to suit both Belarus and European countries, including Poland, the Federal Republic and other countries, because there is too much strain on their social systems. Conditions must be created for employing those people one way or another, and resolve problems between the parties since, as President Lukashenko told me, readmission problems have not been resolved, efforts were suspended on such issues as migrant accommodation, building camps for them, and so on. I hope that direct contacts between the leaders of Belarus and the EU leading countries will help resolve these issues. This is number one. Second. I would like to say the following. I want everyone to know this. We have absolutely nothing to do with any of this. They are trying to shift the responsibility to us at the slightest pretext or even without any pretext. Our airlines do not carry those people. Not a single one of our airlines is involved. By the way, President Lukashenko told me that Belavia Airlines does not carry migrants either. They take charter flights, and with a visa-free arrangement these people just buy their tickets and come over. Indeed, there are certain groups that are shipping those people to the European countries, but those groups have been operating for a long time. The key link is in the EU countries. Those who are located there organise all those chains. Let their law enforcement and security services deal with them if they are violating their laws. But I get the impression that it is rather hard to bring them to account there, because if we look at the national legislation of the European countries, they are not violating anything. Someone living in one country wants to move to another one due to their concerns– security concerns or even for economic reasons. If a law is violated, then the law enforcement and security services of those countries must deal with those groups. And they should certainly collaborate with those countries that the migrants cross to get to Europe, including Belarus. Let me stress this again: Russia has absolutely nothing to do with that. We are not involved in any processes whatsoever. Pavel Zarubin: An odd situation is emerging there now as they practically want to ban people from buying air tickets to fly out their countries. Why has the plight of those people been moved to the sidelines and nobody seems to care about them? Vladimir Putin: That is exactly what I said. There are humanitarian issues, there are small children there. Honestly, when I watch that, I first of all feel empathy for the children. Look, the temperature drops below freezing at night while those people are sitting there without any resources, which are running out. When they arrive, they have some money with them, but money does not appear out of thin air, and they spend what they have there, on the border. Yes, the people arouse sympathy, of course. I am not talking about the causes or what is going on there. I certainly feel sorry for the people. Pavel Zarubin: There is an issue that has to do with Russia. Recently President of Belarus Lukashenko threatened that he could cut off gas transit to Europe, and it is Russian gas. Moreover, Belarus addressed Russia with a request for the strategic aviation to patrol the skies over Belarus. What can you say about that? Vladimir Putin: They did not exactly address us. The strategic aviation cannot do anything to resolve such crises. We have scheduled exercises with our Belarusian colleagues, as we do regularly. It is our Western partners who constantly hold regular and irregular drills of various kinds there. We also do that, and our strategic aviation also regularly flies and marks the presence of our strategic aviation along its patrol routes. Pavel Zarubin: What about Russian gas and its transit? Vladimir Putin: To be honest, this is the first time I hear about it because I spoke with Mr Lukashenko twice recently and he never told me about that, not even a hint. But he can probably do that. Although there is nothing good about it and I will certainly talk to him about this issue, unless he just said it in the heat of the moment. However, we already have experience with Ukraine doing similar things. In 2008, if my memory serves me right, there was a crisis when we were unable to agree on the basic contract parameters among incessant arguments over the price of gas and transit. It came to the point that Ukraine blocked our gas bound for European consumers. They simply, as specialists say, turned off the tap and closed off the transit of Russian gas to Europe. This did happen. Of course, theoretically, Lukashenko, as president of a transit country, can issue an order to cut off our deliveries to Europe even though it will violate our transit contract. I hope it will not come to that. But on the other hand, sanctions are imposed on him and there is a threat of new sanctions. However, it would do more damage to Europe's energy sector and would not contribute to the development of our relations with Belarus as a transit country. Pavel Zarubin: You have already mentioned the US drills, and the atmosphere and the situation are generally very tense. In the past days and hours, we have seen multiple articles in the Western media claiming that Russia is plotting a military invasion in Ukraine, and supposedly the United Stated even warned their EU partners that Russia is preparing such an invasion. Notably, we can see concurrently that the United States and NATO are conducting an exercise right at our borders, in the Black Sea. How do you asses the entire situation? Vladimir Putin: I have not seen such alarmist declarations, so far, at least. But I suppose it is as you say. Indeed, the United States and their NATO allies are presently conducting an unscheduled, and I want to stress that it is unscheduled, drill in the Black Sea. They deployed a powerful naval group and they are also using the air force in the drill, including strategic aviation. Here is a part of the answer to your previous question about where and how our strategic missile carriers fly. They use the B 51, which are pretty old aircraft but it is not the carriers that matter. The point is that they have combat strategic weapons onboard, which is a grave challenge for us. I should say that our Defence Ministry also suggested holding an unscheduled drill in the area of the Black Sea but I do not think it is expedient and there is no need to aggravate the situation there even further. For that reason, the Russian Defence Ministry has limited its actions to escorting their aircraft and ships. This is number one. Second, regarding Ukraine. We are being urged to implement the Minsk agreements and are often accused of not observing them. However, when we ask our partners, including in the Normandy format, exactly which part of the Minsk agreements Russia is not fulfilling and what, in their opinion, Russia is supposed to do under the Minsk agreements, we get no answer. This is exactly what they say:– We cannot put it into words. I am not kidding, this is the dialogue we are having. And what exactly have the Lugansk and Donetsk people's republics failed to do regarding the Minsk agreements? There is no answer either; again they cannot put it into words. Meanwhile, they publicly demand that we implement them. And now the second issue regarding who the party to the conflict is. The Minsk agreements do not state that Russia is a party to the conflict, we never agreed to this and never will; we are not a party to it. Meanwhile, what are the Kiev authorities doing? Let me remind you of the most recent history. The acting president made a decision to engage armed forces to resolve the conflict in the southeast, in Donbass. It was the first attempt to resolve the issue by using military force. Then Mr Poroshenko, who by that time had become president, made the second attempt, despite efforts to convince him otherwise, of using the military to resolve the issue. We are well aware of how this attempt ended and what tragedies it brought. It was they who started it. Now the current president merrily reports that they are using the Bayraktars, that is, unmanned combat aerial vehicles. This is aviation, even though it is unmanned it is still aviation, used in the conflict zone, which is strictly prohibited by the Minsk agreements and subsequent agreements. However, it elicits no response whatsoever. Europe said something inarticulate about it while the US in effect supported it. Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials say outright: we used them and will continue to use them further. Concurrently they arranged unscheduled drills in the Black Sea. There is an impression that they do not want to let us relax. Well, they should know that we do not relax anyway. Pavel Zarubin: In this format, under such conditions, does it make any sense to have a Normandy format meeting which both the European partners and Ukraine insist on? Vladimir Putin: I have not heard the latest insistent suggestions, although we are discussing it. I think we do not have any other mechanisms, and however hard the situation is today, however difficult solving this issue might be, these mechanisms should be used so as to at least approach the settlement of the problems we are talking about."

But representatives of the adult audience, professionals are also watching and listening to us and will take part in our meeting. So, I would like to say to our boys and girls: if something seems a bit boring, please forgive me in advance but I must talk to all the participants in our meeting. I will start with general things. Artificial intelligence technology has truly become part of our lives. Today, it is a field that attracts talented, creative people that are ready to dream big and work toward their goals. It is the cutting edge of science and engineering. It is very important to make sure that these breakthroughs opening up truly limitless opportunities do not harm but help people, help save our planet and ensure its sustainable development. I am hoping we will certainly discuss all these issues at Sber's international conference that has already become, to quote Mr Gref, one of the main global venues for discussing artificial intelligence. I am very glad that schoolchildren and students from Russia and other countries are taking part in our discussion today. You are already creating a new technological world. You are doing this with your hands and your heads. You are offering interesting solutions– I will be pleased to see the projects that you presented at Sber's contest. But first I would like to congratulate you, Mr Gref, and thousands of your employees, on an important anniversary. Savings banks were established on November 12, 1841. This is where Sber's history begins. Over 180 years, Sber has always been and, I am sure, will remain a truly people's bank, a financial institution that is critical to our country's economy. Suffice it to say that Sber has over 100 million clients. While successfully carrying out its main mission, you are actively and, most important, sincerely and enthusiastically advancing the ideas of technical progress. Using ground-breaking solutions, you are trying to adapt Sber's entire ecosystem to serve people, providing an example of the major changes that are taking place around the world. A completely different paradigm for how companies, businesses and whole industries operate is taking shape literally before our eyes. The goal is not just to put a new product onto the market or build effective production or business models. The main thing is to aim all work toward the interests and needs of individual customers. Let me repeat, it is not a commodity or service but people that play the central role in all economic processes. This transformation is affecting not only the economy but also the social sphere and government administration. Of course, Big Data and artificial intelligence are playing a key role in this respect. The winners in today's world are those who are making better use of the powerful technological potential in the interests of people and their prosperity. They are winning the global competition. We, that is, Russia must certainly be among the leaders in this regard. Our companies, including Sber, are developing and introducing unique solutions in healthcare and education, environmental protection and agriculture, industry and transport. We have to accelerate the digital transformation across the board and as soon as possible move from isolated experiments and pilot initiatives to end-to-end projects with AI applications, primarily in areas that determine quality of life. In a word, we have to make the technologies of the future accessible right now and see that they serve all the country's citizens and our national development goals. This is the mission of the state, scientists, engineers and innovative businesses. Friends, We need to carefully analyse our development plans for industry, the social sphere, transport, communications and telecommunications. The plans must be aligned and closely coordinated with sectoral and regional strategies for the introduction of artificial intelligence and, of course, with the progress of our entire development agenda. Indeed, what is the use of the technologies of the future if a certain town or settlement still has low quality communications or lacks internet altogether(this is, regretfully, still a reality, and while cases are hard to find, they do exist), or if a medical worker, teacher or agronomist does not have the necessary equipment and skills to use it? I think it is extremely important– and I want to draw the Russian Government's attention to it– to launch a training programme for sectoral specialists without delay to provide them with a working knowledge of artificial intelligence. It has to be done now. Let me remind you that at our last meeting a year ago we agreed to help businesses conduct technological upgrades and to offer tax incentives to companies and organisations which purchase domestic software, computers and telecommunication devices. Unfortunately, these and other decisions have not been made yet, they are still, in officialese,""being coordinated"" or as bureaucrats say,""pending."" The process has clearly been protracted, and we will discuss this topic in more detail with our colleagues, but I must stress that we will not resolve the issues of rapid technological development with such slow tempos. Let me reiterate. Technologies are developing exponentially, with colossal, explosive speed, right before our eyes. Not long ago it would have all seemed straight out of science fiction. But now Russian automobile plants, our automotive industry is still moving forward in the face of fairly tough competition. Vehicles are being designed which can drive in low visibility, in a snowstorm, on the snow, and they do it not just on the testing grounds but in real life. The Yandex company is set to launch the first driverless taxi service in Moscow, albeit in test mode. I saw it for myself, and I have to say it is impressive. We need to remove as swiftly as possible all excessive barriers to designing and introducing advanced solutions including in AI, to form a regulatory and legal environment which corresponds to the level of the technological progress. However, there are other aspects to consider– who is to be liable for damages if, for instance, a driverless car causes a traffic accident, and cases have already been reported in the world that left authorities unsure of how to proceed. That gives way to questions of how to insure the actions, and in some cases inaction, of robots and AI algorithms. I would like to ask the Government to adjust, in cooperation with the professional community, these and other legal aspects of introducing advanced technical solutions under experimental legal regimes. In part, it is necessary to provide guarantees for protecting the intellectual property of achievements in artificial intelligence. This is not a problem for the future. It is already becoming increasingly urgent. Now I would like to say a few words about access to the data without which it is impossible to develop many types of digital technology. We are well aware of this and have spoken about it more than once. I believe at least two fundamental principles must be at work here. First, it is necessary to have effective mechanisms for the anonymisation and storage of data and maximally clear, understandable rules for providing this anonymous information, as well as firm guarantees for protecting the rights and interests of people, including their private life. Second, in current conditions any attempt to establish a monopoly on data limits free competition and economic development. In this context, I would like to ask you to adopt as soon as possible legal decisions to ensure access of Russian experts on artificial intelligence, research organisations and businesses to the state's anonymised data bases, especially since ministries and departments have already compiled such data sets, to use professional slang. As a next step, I would like the Government and the Bank of Russia to consider the possibility of providing similar access to anonymised data bases from the largest domestic companies, paying special attention, of course, to the safety of personal information. There are many intricate legal and ethical nuances. Why should personal data belong not to an individual but to commercial or financial organisations from which he receives different services? This is a big question because, unfortunately, this is what is happening now in real life. If an individual has the full right to do what he wants with his personal information, he will be able to give it to another company or bank. With this information, they will be able to offer better products to their new client, for instance, a reduced interest loan. I will emphasise that it is necessary to take a very careful and balanced approach to all these issues, considering all aspects of work with databases. Naturally, any action can only be taken with the consent of the individual. A special decision should be made regarding information critical for citizens' security. This concerns primarily biometric data, which are increasingly used for financial and other transactions, including for paying fares, say, in the metro as in Moscow nowadays. I think that such highly personal information must be stored in the unified state system of biometric identification, which means the state must take responsibility for storing it yet ensure free access to it for banks and other organisations, but in a fully encrypted form, which rules out any external interference and open access to one's personal data. Friends, The issues of protecting personal data and digital payments and countering hidden manipulation of citizens' preferences and actions are increasingly coming to the fore. Now it concerns not only ensuring the cybersecurity of a person but also that of their virtual double– the avatar that will live within the metaverses being established now. Their designers promise that by using these virtual worlds a person will be able to traverse space without leaving their home. I know that even those present here are dealing with these issues. All that will definitely help people to be close to other people who may even live on a different continent. Let me remind you that the term""metaverse"" was coined by a famous sci-fi writer three decades ago. According to him, people were fleeing and really found refuge there from the imperfections of the real world. However, such an approach would be too pessimistic for us today; I think we should never take this route. On the contrary, we must use the metaverse opportunities for people to be able to mix, co-work, co-study and pursue joint creative and business projects regardless of the distances between them, no matter how big. This is a true challenge for technology companies, creative industries, for the makers of virtual and mixed reality devices. And also for lawyers who have to work out regulations for economic and public relations in a fundamentally new world, this is undoubtedly a challenge as well. Overall, the creation and application of AI technologies for the sake of society, humankind, for the preservation of our planet, for studying the world ocean and outer space– these are all truly civilisational challenges and absolutely sweeping. We can and should resolve them only by joining our efforts. I would like to use the platform of your conference to invite everyone to participate in open, large-scale cooperation. And, of course, I would like to ask the Government of Russia to create opportunities for our compatriots and foreign engineers, software developers, scientists and teachers to take part, in a convenient online format or some other format, in joint projects carried out in Russia, primarily in science and education. We are launching advanced technology academic programmes in our universities and creating artificial intelligence competence centres at our leading universities and research institutions. Their work will be an important step towards creating a system of interdisciplinary research incorporating both the natural sciences and the humanities, which is indispensable for developing strong artificial intelligence. Specialists say that it will learn and develop by itself, resolving the most difficult tasks in conditions of uncertainty. In fact, our audience today knows all about this. I would like to repeat that we have ambitious plans for developing the educational and digital space for schoolchildren and students and we are very interested in this. Everything is important. That said we all understand well that people are achieving breakthroughs and putting them to use. Paradoxical though it may seem, to be leaders in artificial intelligence what is needed is a humane environment like in a family where parents pass on important moral values to their children and, of course, at school. This is where children should acquire the""soft"" skills that their parents and grandparents developed while playing with their peers, learning to make friends and help each other, overcome setbacks, form close-knit teams and invent all kinds of games and plans, or, as they say now, joint projects. I hope we will discuss today all these complex issues– the technological, moral and ethical aspects of artificial intelligence. Naturally, I am primarily addressing the audience in this hall. Thank you very much for your attention. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67098,APEC summit,2021-11-12T16:40:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow","Vladimir Putin took part, via videoconference, in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit.","The agenda of the summit, chaired by New Zealand, contains items on post-pandemic economic recovery of the region's countries and APEC's key areas of work to 2040. Following the summit, the participants adopted a Final 2021 APEC Economic Leaders' Declaration and the Aotearoa Plan of Action.*** President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Madam Chairperson, colleagues, Like the other speakers, first I would like to thank our partners from New Zealand, the current chair of the APEC forum, for the work they carried out this year in the difficult conditions of the pandemic. In particular, the idea to hold an extraordinary APEC summit in July to discuss the fight against the coronavirus was timely and useful. Logically, our current discussion is focused on issues of socioeconomic recovery and overcoming the pandemic with a view to ensuring sustainable and long-term growth in the Asia-Pacific. As International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva noted, there are still many problems, however the global economy is gradually emerging from the crisis. Indeed, recent forecasts show that by the end of this year the world GDP will have increased by 5.9 percent. Moreover, this figure will be even higher for the APEC economies– an average of 6.4 percent. As for Russia, we have already returned to pre-pandemic levels in terms of GDP growth, and in our estimate, it will be up 4.7 percent in 2021. Of course, this is not the highest figure in the region, but it is not the lowest, either. It is a good figure for our economy. At the same time, many socioeconomic and other problems, which you, colleagues, have already spoken about, persist in the Asia-Pacific and in the world. The coronavirus itself is far from being defeated yet. New, even more dangerous strains of this virus may still appear. So, it is no exaggeration to say that it is vitally important not to slacken our efforts in countering the pandemic and doing everything necessary to strengthen healthcare systems in our countries and improve their resource and technological basis. Naturally, a substantial build-up of international cooperation in the medical and pharmaceutical areas would facilitate the solution to these ambitious goals. The role of the World Health Organisation(WHO) is becoming increasingly important in this context. Its activities certainly deserve all-round support. It is unacceptable to take actions that can encroach on the prerogatives of the WHO, which operates under the aegis of the United Nations. With our common support, the WHO can conduct large-scale immunisation with greater intensity because, unfortunately, as some speakers have also noted here, many countries that need vaccines have no access to them. This is happening for several reasons, including unfair competition, protectionism, and some counties' lack of willingness to mutually recognise vaccines and vaccine certificates. The WHO could expedite the procedures for pre-qualification of new vaccines and medications, that is, an assessment of their quality, safety and efficiency. At the recent G20 summit, Russia suggested to its partners studying the issue of the mutual recognition of national vaccines and certificates as soon as possible. I am confident that the sooner this is done the easier it will be to fully restore global business, tourism and other activities. I would like to emphasise that our country continues helping all countries who need it with supplies of vaccines, medications, equipment, test systems and individual protection gear. Russia, as is well known, was the first in the world to register an anti-COVID-19 vaccine, Sputnik V. As of today, it has been approved in 71 countries with a total population of over four billion people. It has demonstrated its high safety and high efficacy. Apart from the Sputnik V two-component vaccine, Russia developed and is using a one-component vaccine, Sputnik Light, which can be used, among other things, to boost the effectiveness of other vaccines. We also offer it to our partners. Colleagues, The pandemic has revealed that it is of paramount importance for all nations to have free and non-discriminatory access to vitally important goods, services, resources and technology. Russia opposes protectionism in the global economy and trade and advocates an end to the use of unilateral and politically motivated restrictions for the sake of fighting for markets and removing competitors. We firmly believe that maintaining and enhancing the multilateral trade system, with the World Trade Organisation at its core, is in the interests of the entire international community. In late November, Geneva will host the 12th WTO Ministerial Conference, with representatives from all of our economies taking part. I would suggest guiding them towards working out compromise agreements in trade which will contribute to the expansion of reciprocal economic and technological exchanges. Russia is ready to make its contribution to this work. Our country is also keen on the closest cooperation with APEC economies on digitalisation. Digital technologies are a good foundation in resolving the comprehensive task of enhancing connectivity in the Asia-Pacific, and in developing infrastructure, and transport and logistical corridors. We consider that priority areas of cooperation among the APEC members on the digital track include the exchange of advanced experience in introducing digital technologies to traditional economic sectors, training relevant personnel, perfecting the regulatory framework of the information sphere, developing communication systems and communication lines, and the use of AI. Naturally, in discussing cooperation issues among the APEC economies to resolve pressing global and regional problems we must consider the fact that climate change is a very serious challenge. At one time, APEC endorsed, at Russia's initiative, a list of products that contribute to environmental protection and help conserve natural resources. The economies of the forum committed to provide preferential trade requirements for these products. So, we certainly support the proposal by New Zealand's chairmanship to expand the list of these commodities. Russian experts will take a most active part in this work. In general, we believe that trade policy can do more to counter global warming and encourage the introduction of advanced technology to reduce greenhouse emissions. At the same time, the global economy's adaption to new, tougher environmental requirements and the transition to""clean"" energy sources should take into account the entire range of issues of socioeconomic development and strictly rest on universal agreements set forth in the UN framework. Colleagues, All these urgent issues of APEC cooperation are reflected in the Final 2021 APEC Economic Leaders' Declaration and the Plan for implementing long-term APEC development goals to 2040. These documents have been prepared for endorsement following the summit. Russia certainly supports them. We believe both documents are a good foundation for further promoting cooperation within forum in the search for collective responses to the most pressing challenges and threats in the Asia-Pacific Region. I would like to make one more point that we consider important. Greater coordination with other regional forums and organisations with a consonant agenda would make APEC's performance more effective. I am referring to the Eurasian Economic Union, the Association of Southeast Asian Countries and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Russia will do all it can to facilitate this. In general, we intend to take a most active part in developing constructive and mutually beneficial cooperation in the entire vast Asia-Pacific space. In conclusion, I would like to wish success to our friends from Thailand that are taking over the APEC chairmanship. You can certainly rely on our support and assistance. Thank you for your attention."

In bringing together representatives of government and the business and expert community, the Forum plays host to deep and substantive discussions concerning improvements to the quality of products and services, the introduction of effective management methods and, more broadly, the promotion of the principles of sustainable development. I should note that our ability to solve these tasks has a direct impact on our economy's competitiveness. The coronavirus pandemic is one of the main challenges facing us today. Enterprises and organizations have had to adapt to challenging conditions, suspend operations, switch to remote working and do everything in their power to protect people's health and ensure the safety of employees. Even in these difficult times, entrepreneurs and businesses have prioritized preserving and strengthening our economy's production, scientific, technological and human potential. I am confident that constructive proposals will be put forward at the Forum and implemented in practice, and that cooperation between different countries will be supported in the name of our shared future success."""

Minister of Culture Olga Lyubimova provided commentary on the collection. At the end of the tour, the President signed the museum's guest book. The Dostoevsky Moscow House Museum Centre is located in the northern wing of the building that used to be the Mariinskaya hospital for the poor. Here the writer spent his childhood and teenage years, from 1823 to 1837. Previously, the museum occupied only the ground floor; in 2019, in preparation for the celebration of his 200th anniversary, the Vladimir Dal Russian State Literary History Museum received the entire wing, and now the museum centre is part of the V. Dahl Museum. The opening of the Dostoevsky Moscow House is the central event as part of the anniversary celebrations planned in accordance with the Presidential Executive Order. The entire world is marking the great writer's anniversary, not only Russia. UNESCO declared 2021 the Year of Dostoevsky."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67093,Military-Industrial Commission meeting,2021-11-10T17:10:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region","Vladimir Putin held a meeting, via videoconference, of the Military-Industrial Commission of the Russian Federation.","President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, good afternoon. Last week we had a series of meetings on developing the Armed Forces and the defence industry where we discussed system-wide tasks pertaining to re-equipping the Army and Navy. We will continue this discussion at the Military-Industrial Commission meeting today. The first item on our agenda is to consider the main results of state armament programme implementation, and outline the approaches to drafting the new programme for 2024–2033. I have already noted that the state armament programme, which is one of our most significant strategic planning documents, plays a special role in upholding Russia's security and defence. Its priorities include defining and implementing projects under the state defence order, expeditiously taking science and technology advances into serial production, and developing promising new weapons, of course. I would like to note that in 2020, a difficult year, a demanding one, our defence companies fulfilled the state order at 96.2 percent. As a reminder, in 2012, they achieved just over 80, and that was considered good. Now we have climbed to such a high level, and that high bar has been maintained for more than five years. Even with the restrictions necessitated by the coronavirus pandemic, the defence industry has maintained stability, allowing no disruptions or delays in supplies. As a result, the share of up-to-date weapons and equipment in the strategic nuclear forces exceeds 80 percent, and in the general-purpose forces, it is above 70 percent. Russian troops have been supplied with the latest weapons, which are not inferior to their foreign counterparts in their tactical and technical parameters, and are even superior in some respects. Among them are the fifth-generation Su-57 fighter, the Knyaz Vladimir nuclear-powered missile carrier, and the S-500 anti-aircraft missile system. Obviously, in drafting a new state armaments programme we need to comprehensively consider the global trends as we develop combat hardware and arms. We need to focus on introducing advanced information, bio- and cognitive technology, hypersonic arms, weapons based on new physical principles, as well as cutting-edge reconnaissance, navigation, communications and control systems. We should enhance the utility and combat sustainability of military products, partly through artificial intelligence and, of course, extensive use of robotics. Again, these areas will decisively determine the future look and combat potential of our Armed Forces. The second item on our agenda is the implementation of the programme for diversifying defence production lines. This is very important for the sustainable and balanced development of military-industrial complex(MIC) companies and our entire economy and its high-tech branches in the long-term perspective. Specific objectives and targets in this field were set as early as 2016, and I must say we have done a lot in this respect in the past five years. In recent years, the output of civilian products in total MIC production has been increasing steadily. It was 20.9 percent in 2018, 24.1 percent in 2019 and now, 25.6 percent in 2020. It is even higher in some areas of the MIC. At the same time, we have to do better in this area in the future, and we certainly have the reserves for this. We continuously speak about this with corporate executives. It is important to set the correct priorities and to draft mid- and long-term plans on this foundation. We said at a meeting of the commission last year that MIC companies should make broader use of the opportunities opened by national projects and state programmes. Active involvement in these will allow these companies to considerably increase the output of civilian products and introduce advanced technology. Thus, our industry, both civilian and defence, already meets more than half of the requirements of national projects in machines and equipment. As you know, the Government has the authority to determine the amounts, the so-called quotas of state purchases and purchases by companies with state participation. This applies only to domestically produced products. As we have seen, this mechanism is up and running: the share of domestic goods in municipal and state purchases increased to 60.9 percent in the first nine months of 2021, from 55.6 percent in 2020. We must make the most of these opportunities and more actively engage in the fields where defence industry products are in demand. We know these fields: they include ship- and aircraft manufacturing, medical equipment production, the construction industry, and transport and energy engineering, to name a few. At this point, I would like to emphasise again that it is necessary to thoroughly monitor the quality of these products. They must be fully competitive with their foreign counterparts– both in price and in technical specification. I would like you to report today on the specific plans to diversify defence production and any additional, comprehensive solutions that would make it possible to increase demand for the MIC's civilian products and ensure the priority of domestic producers in our internal market. Finally, under the third item on our agenda, we will review nominees for the position of a general designer of arms and combat hardware and the position of head of a priority technological branch in the MIC. I would like to note that this managerial structure has justified itself. It has made it possible to focus authority and clearly define responsibility for implementing practical goals. I hope the people endorsed today will have the right qualities and can confirm their professional and business qualifications, form strong teams(in fact, the teams are already in place but should be, of course, supported and developed) and contribute to implementing key national defence and security projects. This is all I wanted to say by way of an opening remark. Let us get down to business. <…>"
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67091,Meeting with Government members,2021-11-10T15:45:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region","The President held a meeting, via videoconference, with members of the Government of the Russian Federation.","Taking part in the meeting were Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Anton Vaino, First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov, deputy prime ministers Viktoria Abramchenko, Yury Borisov, Tatyana Golikova, Alexander Novak, Marat Khusnullin and Dmitry Chernyshenko, Deputy Prime Minister and Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoy to the Far Eastern Federal District Yury Trutnev, Presidential Aide Maxim Oreshkin, Minister of Economic Development Maxim Reshetnikov and Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov. A number of other ministers, and heads of the Central Bank, the Federal Service for the Oversight of Consumer Protection and Welfare (Rospotrebnadzor), the Federal State Statistics Service, and the Moscow Mayor were also invited to attend the meeting. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, good afternoon. Yesterday we discussed the spread of the coronavirus at a Security Council meeting. Today, I am asking Ms Golikova to begin with this topic and to update her colleagues on the situation after the non-working days that were announced by the Government. Go ahead, please. Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova: Good afternoon, Mr President. Good afternoon, colleagues. Over the past three weeks the weekly incidence growth has been slowing down. After the 44th week of the year, which coincided with the non-working days, the incidence rate increased by 2.1 percent compared to the previous week, down from an 8.7 percent increase a week earlier. Major regions, including Moscow, Moscow Region and St Petersburg still account for 30 percent of all cases, while the remaining 70 percent are in other regions of the country. As of the end of the 44th week, 61 regions reported an increase in the incidence rate, down from 78 regions after the 43rd week and 83 after the 42nd week. (Tatyana Golikova proceeded to review in detail the spread of coronavirus cases in different regions, spoke about increased coronavirus testing numbers, and the allocation of funds from the federal budget to buy 14 million express tests to cover the next three months.) Today, 594,600 medical workers, more than 1,000 medical students and 19,800 volunteer students are providing medical assistance to COVID patients. Of course, we are particularly concerned about the continuing rise in the mortality rate. According to the most recent data, unfortunately, a little over 1,000 of our citizens are dying every day, mostly, people over 60, patients with chronic diseases and unvaccinated people. To date, 301,500 COVID hospital beds have been deployed in Russia, of which 201,000 beds are outfitted with oxygen supply equipment. As of yesterday morning, 82.8 percent of hospital beds were occupied nationwide. (The Deputy Prime Minister reported that herd immunity in the country averages 48.4 percent and the number of vaccinated people over 60 stands at 44.7 percent. She also informed the participants about the implementation of a number of presidential instructions, including the daily monitoring of the availability of medicines and oxygen in the regions, engaging the Defence Ministry and the Emergencies Ministry to help the struggling regions, toughening restrictive measures, such as mandated days off and a ban on entertainment events and night hours at cafes and restaurants, as well as mandatory QR codes to prove vaccination when visiting selected sites and events.) Mr President, let me close with this: despite the fact that we are seeing a certain stabilisation in the situation and a decrease in the number of cases in six regions, we cannot yet safely assume that the situation has stabilised and the spread of the infection has been capped. Therefore, oversight and appropriate actions should continue. In this regard, we need your support, and we need you to issue additional instructions to the regions regarding the need to act on the measures that you laid out at the previous meeting with the Government. (At the request of the President, Ms Golikova reported on steps to overcome emergency situations, in particular, with oxygen supplies, and to ensure the uninterrupted operation of medical organisations. The Deputy Prime Minister also said that the minimum level for herd immunity is 80 percent. She pointed out that all four vaccines registered in Russia are safe and effective, which has been confirmed elsewhere around the world in the countries that are using the Sputnik V and Sputnik Light vaccines.) I would also like to say that our experts and foreign experts with whom we work as a team are saying that 80 percent is not enough to ensure proper protection but that 90–95 percent is the desirable target. For now, we are keeping the bar at no less than 80 percent. So, once again, we strongly encourage our colleagues from the regions and the specialists who engage in this work on a daily basis to conduct the necessary awareness campaigns and, of course, to vaccinate the people in order to protect them and, most importantly, to save their lives. There is nothing more valuable than this, Mr President. (After that, Minister of Science and Higher Education Valery Falkov and Minister of Education Sergei Kravtsov spoke of the organisation of teaching at universities and schools during the pandemic.) Vladimir Putin: Mr Savelyev, what can you say about our container traffic in the Far East? What is going on there? The region is facing problems. Minister of Transport Vitaly Savelyev Savelyev VitalyMinister of Transport of the Russian Federation : Yes, there are problems, and I will now report on them. The international logistics crisis is adversely affecting freight deliveries from Far Eastern seaports. First, the protracted pandemic wrecked long-standing supply chains, we faced this problem, and then deferred freight traffic demand arose later on. Routes passing through Russia, a party to the global logistic market, were also affected by these developments. The most popular container traffic routes proved more vulnerable than the rest, and the whole world is facing this problem. The situation is aggravated by high demand for container carriers on the international freight market. This concerns vessels of the same type that are used on shipping lanes of the Far Eastern Federal District. We are facing an increase in freight costs due to skyrocketing demand; they are 2.5 times higher than before. As a result, coastal shipping companies are no longer able to quickly deploy additional vessels in order to eliminate peak loads on specific routes. We have found that the main problem today is a shortage of vessels. Another negative factor is the low-quality work of private forwarding companies while planning and organising deliveries in the Russian Federation's regions. We are dissatisfied with stevedore companies at ports accepting consignments from the Far Eastern Federal District's regions. They do not handle incoming consignments promptly. <…> Unfortunately, forwarding and stevedoring services is a market that is outside the area of control and responsibility of Russian maritime authorities. However, Rosmorport is the party that enters into agreements with stevedoring companies on our behalf. While these agreements used to cover only the leasing of hydraulic structures, we proposed, unofficially for now, adding provisions on prioritising socially important cargo during loading and port handling. If stevedoring companies do not agree to that, we have a counter proposal: amending the law on Russian sea ports. But we will get back to that following talks with them. In the meantime, the Federal Agency for Sea and Inland Water Transport is currently organising the monitoring of cargo in sea ports, after Rosmorport reported a slowdown in cabotage traffic in view of a potential increase in construction materials shipments to the Russian Far East. (The minister also spoke about measures to address a number of issues – specifically, the daily electronic monitoring of the dispatch and accumulation of cargo at sea ports, arranging delivery of socially important and breakbulk cargo, building an additional fleet of five vessels to relieve peak loads and additional icebreaker support to prevent shipment delays.) We estimate that, unless there is a force majeure situation, all socially important freight will be shipped by the end of November. By mid-December, we plan to reduce the amount of stored cargo at sea terminals to a standard shipload of around 2,200 containers. Currently, we are storing three times more. But we will bring it back to normal and the situation in Far Eastern ports will improve. Mr President, we will try to resolve this issue by using private companies. However, if the cabotage traffic continues to grow (and the signs are all there), we may eventually propose establishing a specialised public shipping company reporting to the Federal Agency for Sea and Inland Water Transport. This company could take charge of some socially important freight under cabotage because currently, it is the prerogative of private companies and, considering the surge in freight charges, they are looking for more affordable vessels while cabotage shipments in the Far East are stalled. We could eliminate this dependence by having a cabotage company in the Far East and meeting the local demand. That is if we cannot find a solution with the private companies. For the time being, we are working on it and I hope we will be out of the woods soon. Vladimir Putin: Mr Savelyev, stevedores, private companies – I do hope you will work with them properly. But is it only about them? The volume of container traffic from China has increased, and you are well aware of this. Container shipments from China are premium traffic, they fetch more profit for Russian Railways, we all know this too, and miners constantly complain about this. You said we need to define priorities, so define them. You cannot leave a whole region without cement or other building materials. And what next? One never knows, there might be some other shortage. Be sure to do things properly here, and as soon as possible, and report to the Prime Minister. Vitaly Savelyev: Accepted. Vladimir Putin: How long will it take to streamline things? Vitaly Savelyev: Mr President, I have already reported. We hope to bring the situation back to normal by the end of November. We will resolve the freight problem that we have, but for this, we need four more vessels. Give us two weeks, and we will just decide on a solution. One option, as I said, is to set up a shipping company. It is not that much money, but we could handle peak loads. Vladimir Putin: Suit yourself. But how long will it take to create a company? And we need to work with Mr Belozerov [General Director – Chairman of the Board of Russian Railways]. Do I need to talk to him or will you? Vitaly Savelyev: No need, we are in touch with him. Mr President, you are right: we have export traffic from China, South Korea and Japan. This is a lot. These containers travel along the Trans-Siberian Railway towards Europe, but we are talking about the cargo that the railway delivers to the Far Eastern ports, and then we have to take care of coastal shipping from the port of Vladivostok, this is the problem. For that, the existing companies, SASCO and FESCO, had to charter more vessels during peak periods. We will resolve this issue. I hope we will find a solution ourselves. Vladimir Putin: Is there enough rolling stock – locomotives, rolling stock? Do you have everything? Vitaly Savelyev: There are no problems with the railway. Everything is working smoothly, and the port has enough capacity. Vladimir Putin: Good. I have heard you. Thank you. (Further on, Head of the Federal Service for State Statistics Pavel Malkov gave a report on the ongoing National Census, carried out between October 15 and November 14 but lasting until early December in certain hard-to-access territories. Over this period, 133.5 million people have been counted, or 91.6 percent of the estimated population number. Mr Malkov said that 314,000 census takers were being employed, or half as many as 10 years ago, when digitalisation was not there to help. Apart from the official census takers, his service was using 25,000 volunteers, who were lending a hand at permanent stations. In the pandemic environment, they sought to provide the census takers with maximum protection, including face masks, gloves, rules of conduct, and regular testing. Thanks to the Sber and VTB, the census takers have insurance, including cover for COVID-19. The President wished the entire census team well with the successful completion of their work, stressing its great importance for the country and its economy and social sphere.) <…> Minister of Agriculture Dmitry Patrushev Patrushev DmitryMinister of Agriculture : In 2021, we have increased areas under the main crops, but adverse weather has led to a certain lag in harvesting rates and a drop in some crop yields. As far as grain is concerned, we hope to harvest127 million tonnes in bunker weight, or 123 million tonnes in terms of net weight. This figure is lower than last year's but it is higher than the average for many years. We are forecasting that the oil-bearing crops will yield 23 million tonnes, a significant increase on 2020, something which was achieved, among other things, through the expansion of areas under oil crops in 2021. We have harvested 38 million tonnes of sugar beet and expect to reach the 40-million mark, or almost six million tonnes more than last year. The organised sector is planning to harvest about seven million tonnes of vegetables, or slightly more than a year before. As of now, we have harvested 6.5 million tonnes of potatoes. I would like to stress that this concerns only the organised sector and harvesting continues. In terms of potatoes, we hope to approach the 2020 figure. At the same time, the weather conditions in 2021 have proved most unfavourable for open-air potato and vegetable growing. I would like to say a few words about the autumn sowing. We have sown 18.6 million hectares and expect to harvest 19.5 million tonnes. Currently we see no problems with seeds, equipment or fuel and lubricants in the farm sector. To keep the mineral fertiliser market stable, the Government is introducing a separate set of measures. We hope that it will result in farmers purchasing the needed amounts of fertiliser at reasonable prices. We expect that the harvest, in combination with the regulatory measures, will make it possible to stabilise prices of socially important food products. This year, the Government introduced a floating export duty on grains. It is currently set at $69.9 per tonne of wheat, which keeps the domestic prices significantly below the world prices. Next, in order to meet the domestic market needs, a tariff quota for grain exports, which provides for a separate quota for wheat, will be introduced in the first half of 2022. The size of the quota will be determined later in the year when we know the final wheat production figures and the export rate in the first half of the current agricultural season. In the event of a significant increase in world prices, say, up to $400 per tonne or more, the formula for calculating the floating export duty will be revised upwards. With regard to other categories, in 2021, the Government introduced restraining export duties on sunflower, rapeseed and soybeans, as well as a damper duty on sunflower oil exports. These measures make it possible to maintain stable prices in this segment. In the event sunflower prices rise sharply in the country or the world prices of sunflower oil go up, the damper duty will be swiftly revised upwards. With regard to potatoes and open-ground vegetables, in addition to the weather, which had a negative effect on the harvest this year, there has been a trend towards a system-wide cut in production on personal subsidiary plots. Notably, traditionally most fruit and vegetables, as well as potatoes, are grown on private plots. <…> In order to increase the production of vegetables and potatoes, it is proposed to launch a separate federal project in 2022, which, among other things, will provide for the following state support measures. First, deploying reclamation efforts in order to involve agricultural land in the production of vegetables and potatoes. Second, increasing the amount of reimbursement for a portion of the direct costs incurred during building or upgrading vegetable and potato storage facilities. Third, taking direct support measures for vegetable and potato producers in order to increase production, meaning that support will be provided depending on the output numbers. Fourth, plans are in place to provide subsidies to the owners of subsidiary plots who engage in the production of potatoes and fruits and vegetables. This is something we did not do before, but we will start supporting vegetable growers starting in 2022. We hope that these measures will have a positive effect on the production volumes. On a separate note, the current harvest of sugar beets will make it possible to produce about 5.5 million tonnes of sugar. A tariff quota for refined and raw sugar imports may be introduced next year to meet the domestic demand. However, importantly, if we continue to contain prices that way, there are risks of the sugar beet producers reorienting their efforts to more lucrative crops, including grains and oilseeds. We cannot afford to have the developments go down that path. We believe that further decisions in the sugar industry should be aimed at maintaining the economic incentive for the stable production of sugar beets and our own sugar. As for livestock produce, pork production growth has been slowing down due to outbreaks of the African swine fever in several regions. We expect production to be restored in the first half of 2022. In the poultry sector, the poultry population declined against the backdrop of a challenging epizootic situation and disruptions in the supplies of imported hatching eggs, which led to a decrease in poultry production. We expect to reach 2020 production levels by the end of this year. For beef, we forecast a production increase of about 1.5 percent in 2021. At the same time, to support the processing sector and stabilise meat prices, the Agriculture Ministry proposed setting the preferential tariff on frozen pork imports up to 100,000 tonnes and up to 200,000 tonnes for frozen beef. Mr President, we hope that these measures will help stabilise prices. That concludes my report. Thank you for your attention. Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much. Indeed, much has been done. We discussed this with Mr Mishustin, and he has already briefed me on these proposals. Still, I would like to draw your attention to what has just been said. Prices of nitrogen-based mineral fertilisers, of chemical fertilisers on Russia's domestic market are three or four times lower compared to the European market. Of course, this makes it very tempting for producers to prefer premium markets. We must take this into consideration and prevent any disruptions in the agricultural sector. We are also aware of the second factor: with the rising prices of fuel and gas, which is used for making fertilisers, major European producers have cut their output by almost one half –by more than 40 percent. According to international data, another major exporter, China, is also moving towards limiting exports. With all these factors in mind, we have to seriously think about what will be happening to crop land around the world, in Europe, and more specifically with food products, with crop lands used to grow cattle feed, and how this will impact meat products. We must take all this into consideration and take the relevant decisions in a timely manner. As for advance declarations, all this has to be taken into consideration and the corresponding decisions made as soon as possible. Overall, there is no doubt that this package of measures is adequate and well-balanced. Of course, you have to find a way to make sure that it is carried out, and prevent any decline in the production of the goods and fertilisers we need for delivering on our agriculture development plans. Overall, thank you. You and I will keep a close eye on these developments. Thank you. All the best."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67072,Meeting with Director General of Russian Helicopters Andrei Boginsky,2021-11-08T13:55:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with Director General of Russian Helicopters Holding Andrei Boginsky.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Boginsky, the national helicopter industry has always flourished, and we have always felt rightfully proud of it. To the best of my knowledge, 8,000 Russian-made helicopters are now in use in 100 countries. Director General of Russian Helicopters Andrei Boginsky: Yes, that is right. Vladimir Putin: Your company has become large and efficient. Let's discuss its performance and prospects. Andrei Boginsky: Mr President, first I would like to mention some basic corporate data. We are located in several time zones. We have enterprises in the Far East, Siberia, the Ural area, Central Russia and even in the western-most region, namely, Kaliningrad. The holding employs over 38,000 people. As you have already noted, today, over 8,000 civilian and military helicopters are being used in the Russian Federation and all over the world. More than 430 companies use them. State support allows us to manufacture about 360 helicopters annually. The holding also has two enterprises that design and manufacture vital units, including reduction gears… Vladimir Putin: You have three design bureaus, right? Andrei Boginsky: Yes, three design bureaus. The National Centre for Helicopter Engineering is now one company and unites the Mil and Kamov design bureaus. We have a new design bureau called VR-Technologies, and I will discuss its performance later on. The Kazan Helicopter Plant has its own design bureau that makes the well-known Ansat helicopter which is involved in the air ambulance programme. Above all that, we provide after-sales maintenance for our helicopters. We operate six aircraft repair centres here in Russia and have ten more partner centres abroad that service both civil and military aircraft. We are also working to upgrade and open ten more service centres in cooperation with our partners. While the maintenance centres in Russia have been part of the holding and the majority of them were handed over to us by the Defence Ministry(the centre in Novosibirsk was our own from the start), when it comes to foreign service centres, they are the result of our partnerships, which largely depend on the volume of exports. The more we supply, the more services they need to provide. We currently have three joint ventures with our foreign partners. The first joint venture, with Agusta in Italy, is based in the Moscow Region. It is an assembly facility for Agusta 139 helicopters. I would like to tell you about our results of the past five years and our plans until 2025 and 2030. In the past five years, we supplied 865 gas turbine helicopters to the domestic and foreign markets. It is the second highest result in the world for civil and military aircraft. In 2017, we significantly increased the share of civil helicopters and maintained this result in the subsequent years. As a result, we have been able to ensure that the holding makes profit during the general decline on the global helicopter market and despite the drop in state defence orders and decreasing military technical cooperation. Overall, the general decline on the global market has been 30–35 percent since 2016. But thanks to our own work, to the support from the state and your personal support, Mr President, we have increased the share of civil aircraft, specifically ambulance aircraft. Today we are the second largest manufacturer and supplier of helicopters, which is a reason to be proud. In the next five years, we plan to increase our key performance indicators. We plan to produce and sell over 1,100 helicopters domestically and abroad by the end of 2025. We expect our share of civil aircraft to exceed 50 percent by 2023. To maintain our leading positions in the world, we are working to increase production and revenue threefold and consolidated profits fourfold by 2030 compared to 2020. This is our goal for 2030. We plan to attain this ambitious goal thanks to the broad range of our products. They are widely represented in various sectors. Today our commercially produced combat and military transport helicopters allow us to fully meet the demands of our main client– the Defence Ministry, as well as other law enforcement agencies, and to hold leading positions in the supply of military products to international markets, with active support from Rosoboronexport. We also produce competitive civilian equipment of various applications. The Mi-8 helicopter and its modifications are holding the lead in the segment of heavy utility helicopters. The Ansat, Ka-226, Ka-32 and Mi-26 helicopters comprise the basis for our expansion in other segments. You have first-hand knowledge of many of these models, because you have been using them. We are proud of this and regard this as a high assessment of the work of our personnel. At the same time, we understand that to keep our position in the market we must continue to modernise our products and market new models. Therefore I would like to tell you about our main projects, first in the civilian and after that in the military segment. Mr President, I would like to tell you about the Mi-171A3 helicopter, a special project we are creating for flights over water bodies to offshore drilling rigs. It meets the international industry standards of the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers. When we market this helicopter, the Russian companies that are involved in joint international projects will be able to use our equipment for offshore oil projects, taking out insurance for both equipment and passengers. This was impossible before. Vladimir Putin: Did they buy foreign-made equipment? Andrei Boginsky: Yes, they did. But now we have created such a helicopter. In fact, before getting down to this, we worked hard together with our enterprises and the fuel and energy sector, in particular Gazprom, to coordinate the technical configuration of a helicopter that would meet the requirements of Russian oil and gas companies and international standards. Vladimir Putin: Its maximum speed is 280 km, and what is its cruise speed? Andrei Boginsky: It will be 250–260 km. Vladimir Putin: Quite good. Andrei Boginsky: Yes, and this is definitely a major achievement for the holding and for the fuel and energy companies. We plan to market this helicopter internationally. The next thing I would like to tell you about is a project we started discussing with our Chinese colleagues in 2008. Vladimir Putin: A heavy helicopter? Andrei Boginsky: Yes, a helicopter. An intergovernmental agreement was signed during your visit to Beijing in 2016. Intensive talks had been underway since 2008, and on June 25, 2021, we signed the contract. In accordance with the contract, we will create part of the equipment, namely, the transmission system, the tail rotor, and the ice protection system, plus we will be working on the service life of this helicopter. It is a rather big project that will take approximately 13 years. It will involve hard work, which is why it is a serious project for us, and especially for young people, a project on which we will be working for a long time, also accumulating additional skills and competencies. The third project is a single-engine helicopter. We began designing it ourselves. Its coaxial configuration allows us to make it smaller but still functional. We can offer the biggest cabin in this category, and it can be equipped for seven uses: passenger, corporate, air taxi, cargo, police, medical and training. This is a domestic design that we are developing in line with the European requirements. We started this project in 2016 and are now developing the first flying prototype and creating a stand for ground and air-based tests. We are working on it at our subsidiary in Europe, in Italy, in order to have it certified in markets that require EASA(European Aviation Safety Agency) and FAA(US Federal Aviation Administration) certification. Unfortunately, for the time being they have bigger preferences than we do. We realise that we should not stop at that and predict growth in the number of city agglomerations in the world where urban air mobility will become an urgent issue. Experts believe we will need over 15,000 helicopters in cities. Naturally, this project must conform to the growing requirements on reducing noise and harmful emissions. All major companies in this industry use electric engines. A battery with the required capacity-weight ratio that would allow it to last for a long time does not yet exist for aircraft. Today, our limit is 20 minutes. This is certainly not enough to make this project commercially viable. Therefore, we are developing a new area– first, we are working on a hybrid power unit, installing a battery in addition to the gas turbine engine, which makes this helicopter safer. If its engine fails, it can stay in the air up to five minutes, and the crew can find a place for an emergency landing while still in the air. Electric is the next stage. This is still a model for our future, but we believe after 2030 it will likely become reality. Our next project for India is the Ka-226. We did a lot of work and signed an intergovernmental agreement. We established a joint venture in India in 2017. We worked hard with our Indian colleagues to localise these helicopters in conformity with the requirements of the intergovernmental agreement. If you remember, you showed this to the Prime Minister at the Eastern Economic Forum in 2019. Vladimir Putin: I remember. Andrei Boginsky: We have changed many things in this helicopter and made it lighter to meet their requirements. It is now 400 kg lighter than before. Vladimir Putin: For use in the mountains. Andrei Boginsky: Yes, for use in the mountains. <…>"

The Governor recalled another landmark date marked just recently. Eighty years ago, on October 30, 1941, the heroic Defence of Sevastopol began a defensive effort against Nazi invaders that lasted 250 days. Mr Razvozhayev mentioned that recently another remarkable date was celebrated – the 80th anniversary of the beginning of the Siege of Leningrad. By the decision of the President, 50,000 rubles' worth of additional financial support was provided to residents of the besieged Leningrad and to those who had been awarded the medal For the Defence of Leningrad. The Governor requested that a similar measure be approved to provide assistance to residents of the besieged Sevastopol and to those who had been awarded the medal For the Defence of Sevastopol. The President supported the request. Another topic discussed during the meeting was a cultural cluster that is to be established on Cape Khrustalny, in accord with the instructions of the President. Mr Razvozhayev reported that a Museum of the Heroic Defence of Sevastopol in 1941–1942, with a Hall of Glory, will be constructed at the location, also in accordance with the President's instructions. A competition for the architectural concept has already been announced; funding for the building works has already been included in the targeted federal programme. The Governor added that he agreed with the President's remark that no residential buildings should be constructed in Cape Khrustalny's park area, as had been previously planned. He confirmed that every effort would be made to use the territory for the creation of a public space."

We have just had a telephone conversation with the President of Russia, and we have already exchanged greetings. I would like to welcome all members of the Supreme State Council to our meeting. Today, Russia is celebrating a wonderful holiday, National Unity Day, and I would like on behalf of all Belarusian people to congratulate you, Mr President, in connection with the events you are holding in Crimea, and also to extend my greetings to all members of the Supreme State Council and all Russians on this wonderful holiday. I would also like to make a request to my good friend and colleague: Mr Putin, if you have the opportunity, at least via Crimea's leadership, would you please pass on the most sincere greetings from Belarusians to Crimea's residents and wish them good health and courage amidst these difficult times. They must understand that they are not alone, we stand next to each other and will support and help each other during this challenging period. Friends, Dmitry Mezentsev and his colleagues have made high-quality preparations for this Meeting of the Supreme State Council. If you do not mind, we could start and complete the meeting quite quickly. It is not only well prepared, there are the meeting materials, documents and issues that have been repeatedly handled by the two presidents over the past three years. I remember that Mr Putin proposed many issues for consideration back in winter, in Sochi. Over the past three years, we have addressed 18 major issues and considered them at meetings of the Council of Ministers of the Union State; today we will sign corresponding documents that are required for the approval and entry into force of Union State laws. Mr President, in line with tradition, I would like to say a few words, then you will make a speech, and we will start working according to plan. Mr President, members of the Supreme State Council, meeting participants, We all are pleased to see each other in good health– which is particularly relevant today. Allow me, as the chairman, to declare this meeting open. Regrettably, various challenges and threats for Belarus and Russia, aggravated by the ongoing global pandemic, have disrupted the schedule of our regular contacts. For Belarus, the Union State is the utmost priority. Jointly, we have established a unique integration model that ensures equal rights for Belarusian and Russian people and increases our economic interaction. We actively cooperate in various areas, aim at further expanding the union integration, and protect our brotherly nations' common historical and ethical values. The unprecedented external pressure has become a serious test of the strength of relations between our countries– and we can definitely say we have withstood this test. Moreover, we have become stronger. This is demonstrated by the economic statistics. In the first nine months of this year, the union's trade increased by over one-third reaching $28 billion in this difficult time. Our foreign policy cooperation is extensive; Belarus and Russia have a common stance on all current issues at various international platforms. I should also note our close cooperation in the defence industry. As the latest events have demonstrated, the Union State's Regional Forces Group serves as a stable security shield for both our countries and for the entire post-Soviet space. Mr Putin and I are open about our intentions to reinforce this group in the future. A particular topic of the union's development is the work to solve social issues and protect citizens' interests. We have achieved the most impressive results in pursuing a coordinated social policy that ensures a dignified life and free development for the people. Citizens of our countries have equal rights in labour, recreation, healthcare, and education. Yet, life is ever-changing, and all of us recognise the necessity to advance further in building our union state and to ensure the protection of Russia's and Belarus' interests in the global space. We persistently and steadily improve our internal public processes. Just recently, the Russian Federation has implemented a constitutional reform and outlined ambitious plans for reform and development. Belarus is going to follow suit and implement constitutional reform. I think we will hold the corresponding referendum and adopt the new Constitution in February. This will serve as a basis for our advancement and stable progress. In 2019, together with President Putin, we set a common task for the two countries' governments to assess the outcome of union integration and define steps for its further progress. Today, we are adopting a report on the practical work done. The documents have been approved by the Council of Ministers of the Union State and require approval by the Supreme State Council, at its meeting today. After that, the two countries' governments will have to take measures on implementing a wide range of conceptual solutions within the next two years. Actually, we are starting the reset of our joint economic space. These efforts include the introduction of advanced technologies, styles and methods of decision-making. This should result in the creation of a new environment for goods and services' turnover, the establishment of joint industry markets, and pursuing common financial, tax, lending, industrial and other policies. We should take the cooperation between our government authorities to the next level and set the task of solving issues related to bilateral relations as a priority, with due account for mutual interests. Yet, I would like to caution the governments from delving into excessive theory; we should see the practical results of our decisions almost right away. I am speaking about the implementation of our major joint projects. We already have positive examples; they have been repeatedly discussed at the level of heads of state– particularly, those in nuclear energy and space exploration. We also have specific agreements on other promising areas of joint work, which we have repeatedly discussed with the President, as I have mentioned. These include a project on manned space exploration, which implies creating a new Earth remote sensing system that produces ultra-high-resolution imaging; and a project in microelectronics where we agreed to do expansive work to develop and build an electronic component database. I would ask the Permanent Committee of the Union State and personally Mr Mezentsev to keep a close watch on all these issues. All the agreements of the presidents on such important and prospective areas must be formalised through a corresponding resolution by the union's authorities. Dear meeting participants, I am confident that the decisions we are adopting today demonstrate once again the immense potential for further development of our unification. We have a lot of work to do– but I am sure we will accomplish all the set tasks in full to the benefit of our countries and peoples, which is in line with the goals and principles of building the union state. Thank you for your attention. Mr President, I would like to ask you to speak on these issues on the agenda. President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Lukashenko, friends, The meeting of the Supreme State Council of the Union State we are holding today is, without exaggeration, truly important. We will be adopting a series of documents for further promoting and enhancing the economic, political and military integration of Russia and Belarus. It is symbolic that this meeting is taking place on a special day for Russia– National Unity Day. Mr Lukashenko, thank you very much for your congratulations. This holiday symbolises the sincere and deep love of our Motherland, as well as the triumphant spirit of unity that has been passed on from one generation to another for many centuries. In this regard, Russia and Belarus have much in common. We share the bond of centuries-old brotherly friendship, a shared past, spiritual and moral values, and quite often, family ties. In all times, our peoples have assisted one another in their hour of need. Together, we have defended freedom and independence, fought shoulder to shoulder against external enemies, and worked hand in hand to ensure the wellbeing and prosperity of our peoples. I have said this on many occasions, but still I would like to reiterate that for Russia, Belarus is not just a good neighbour and our closest ally, with whom we have built a relationship of mutual respect and support, seeking to take into account each other's interests, but also a truly brotherly Republic, a brotherly people. Making sure that it stays this way forever is our unwavering commitment. Since the citizens of our countries want unity, 25 years ago Russia and Belarus embarked on a journey to establish a political and economic integration structure, the Union State. Over the past quarter of a century, we have accomplished a great deal together for our common economic space. Our countries' economies are closely intertwined and deeply interconnected. Russia is the main business partner for Belarus and accounts for almost one half of Belarus' foreign trade. We rank first in terms of direct investment in the Belarusian economy, that's about US$4 billion. Some 2,400 Russian companies operate in Belarus. In turn, Belarus is Russia's number one trading partner within the CIS and ranks fourth among all our foreign trade partners with a share close to 5 percent. Even during the coronavirus pandemic, as the President of Belarus has just mentioned, there has been some positive momentum in our bilateral economic cooperation. In particular, according to the data we have, in the first eight months of 2021 bilateral trade increased by almost 36 percent to US$24 billion, while Mr Lukashenko has data for the first nine months: the numbers could be approaching US$28 billion, which is a very robust result. Multifaceted sectoral ties and industrial cooperation between Russia and Belarus are also picking up steam with new shared value chains and a growing common transport infrastructure. We are carrying out high-tech, research-intensive projects, including the construction of a nuclear power station in Belarus– the first unit was launched this year. I would like to remind you about the proposal put forward by Belarus; the President of Belarus also mentioned this in his remarks. It deals with adding a Belarusian cosmonaut to the International Space Station crew. Yesterday, we discussed this with Roscosmos executives in Sochi. We are ready to support this proposal and to carry it out soon. We need to agree on some aspects, but these are not challenging matters, so I am sure we will resolve them. As for integration, we will not rest on our laurels. The President of Belarus said we would be approving a comprehensive and far-reaching document today: the Guidelines for Implementing the Provisions of the Treaty Establishing the Union State for 2021–2023. This is the fruit of lengthy, intensive, and sometimes challenging talks between our governments and corresponding agencies. Mr Lukashenko and I kept a close eye on the progress of these talks. This document covers 28 sectoral Union programmes designed to promote a coordinated macroeconomic strategy, introduce unified taxation principles, which is extremely important, implement a common policy in the credit and financial and banking sectors, in industry and agriculture, harmonise regulations for the unified oil, gas and electric power markets and for transport services. By the way, I have just mentioned the oil and gas markets. We keep a close eye on these matters since they are very important and often cause controversy and heated debate. Nevertheless, even in this sphere we have achieved serious progress. You are probably aware of what has been going on in the global oil and gas markets. Today, Belarus receives natural gas from Russia at a price that is seven or eight times, and at certain points, nine or ten times lower than the European spot markets. Even if we are talking about gas supplies to our consumers under Gazprom's long-term contracts and make a comparison with them, the price Belarus pays is still three or four times lower. This concerns the people of Belarus and the households there that get energy at the lowest possible price. This also benefits the entire Belarusian economy and its industry, placing it in a favourable competitive environment, which facilitates its development. By carrying out these sectoral integration programmes, Russia and Belarus can create an equal and unified business environment. The two economies will follow common rules and standards, which creates new, truly broad opportunities to promote their progress and will benefit all sectors without exception. Of course, full economic integration would be impossible without progress on establishing a single migration and visa space. It is essential that we fully deliver on the promise of unimpeded labour mobility and guarantee our citizens the freedom of movement while taking into consideration all associated security risks. This is the purpose of the Union State Migration Policy Concept as drafted by our governments. A lot has been done on this front as well. Building the Union State is not just about intertwined economies, but also about coordinating our efforts in other spheres, including political and defence matters. The President of Belarus has mentioned this as well. In this regard, it is essential that we facilitate close ties between Russian and Belarusian ministries and agencies. Of course, the role of the Permanent Committee of the Union State will be growing. Creating an atmosphere of stability and security along our external borders has special importance in this context. We will work together to counter any attempts to interfere in the domestic affairs of sovereign states. Make no mistake, Russia will continue supporting the brotherly people of Belarus. The Union State will make meaningful progress in promoting integration. At the end of the day, this will improve the standard of living and wellbeing of our people. Of course, we will keep up our targeted efforts to give new significance to the Union State and fully unlock its creative potential. Thank you for your attention. <…> Vladimir Putin: Yes, I am indeed in Sevastopol today to mark National Unity Day as well as to attend the unveiling of this monument. It is a great statue I think, and I recommend everyone to see it. And the story itself is quite exciting, I mean the people depicted– the Berens twin brothers as far as I know– looking so valiant and handsome. One of them joined the'red' side and commanded the navy in the Russian Federation, and the other– the White Movement naval forces. Both were admirals, and they never saw each other again after one of them emigrated from Russia. Both died without ever seeing each other again. It is an interesting story, and I hope that this symbolism– the twins, two naval commanders standing side by side on this pedestal– truly reflects a return to the unity of the multiethnic Russian nation. We will always be happy to see you here so you can see it. If I may, Mr President, a few words about today's agenda. Like yourself, I too would like to thank our governments for the work done. It was a complex and multi-vector effort. But there is something else I would like to say in this regard. Colleagues, we are well aware that today, with the recent economic losses and challenges in the social sphere caused by the coronavirus, one of the most effective tools for overcoming this crisis is to combine efforts with countries located close to each other. Countries that are neighbours are opting for cooperation, directing joint efforts towards the economy in general or towards specific industries, and looking for solutions through integration, among other possibilities. This is happening all over the world; I would like to emphasise this. You are well aware that this is happening across the globe– in Southeast Asia, in Africa, South America, Central and North America– everywhere, certainly including Europe. Unfortunately, the post-Soviet countries are lagging behind in many areas of such integration. We are not making full use of the opportunities, the competitive advantages we have inherited from the Soviet Union. I am referring to the common infrastructure, the common energy grid, and the Russian language, which has a unifying power and helps us communicate with each other. However, we have made good progress in developing the Union State, advancing further than on other tracks. Incidentally, such uneven integration is seen in almost all integration associations, to one degree or another. There is nothing unusual here. And the fact that we have made progress, as the President of Belarus said today, is setting a good example to our partners, in the EAEU as well as in other post-Soviet platforms. We certainly hope that the agreements reached by our governments in the previous period, the ones we have formalised today by signing the document we have gathered here to discuss, will be a major step forward, absolutely unrelated to any of our countries' internal political agendas. It simply reflects the need for our economies to function effectively and create competitive advantages in order to improve the efficiency of our work, which ultimately aims to improve our citizens' living standards. Mr President, I would like to thank you for having kept this process under constant review, for your part. And to all our colleagues as well, thank you very much."
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67065,Greetings on National Unity Day,2021-11-04T17:00:00Z,Sevastopol,"On National Unity Day, Vladimir Putin visited a memorial complex dedicated to the end of the Russian Civil War in Sevastopol. The President laid flowers at the eternal flame near the monument and congratulated the people of Crimea and all citizens of Russia on the national holiday.","Built on the instruction of the President, the memorial was unveiled on April 22, 2021, on the banks of the Karantinnaya Bay. The Russian Military Historical Society, with support from the International Council of Russian Compatriots, carried out this project; it was designed by Chairman of the Artists' Union of Russia Andrei Kovalchuk. The monument presents a sculptural composition with two male figures at the centre symbolising the two opposing sides in the Civil War. Above them rises a statue on a pedestal representing Mother Russia that calls on its sons to be reconciled. The bottom of the monument carries the inscription:""We are a single people, and we have only one Russia."" This is where the eternal flame is burning.*** President of Russia Vladimir Putin: People of Sevastopol, Crimea and Russia! Today we mark National Unity Day here in Hero City Sevastopol, in Crimea and all across our vast country. This holiday celebrates the core, essential values that we can all relate to. These include a sincere love for our homeland, respecting our ancestors, and being worthy of their feats in combat and outstanding achievements, as well as our commitment to serve the people of our country, to work hard for the sake of its development and the good of its people. Caring for our Fatherland, and a willingness to stand up for it and defend it has been part of the character of our millions-strong, multi-ethnic people. National Unity Day marks a dramatic, life-changing period in the history of our country. In the early 17th century, Russia found itself on the brink of losing its sovereignty and could have disappeared from the European and world maps forever. However, the people of Russia did not let this happen. They came together in a volunteer army led by Minin and Pozharsky to defend their homeland, chase out the invaders and traitors, restore a strong state, and stop sectarian strife. They took on the task of saving the country and paved the way for Russia's revival and strengthening. More than four centuries have passed since then, but the feat accomplished by the people still strikes us with its powerful outflow of patriotic feelings, and the fact that people came to understand that there was nothing more important than their Motherland's destiny and future. It is thanks to their unity that the people of Russia have achieved remarkable heights in economics, science, technology and culture. Religious leaders representing Russia's traditional religions have invariably played a special role in consolidating our society and reinforcing the values that bind us together. However, there have also been periods when historical challenges undermined the unity of our people. This was the case with the 1917 revolution and the new, terrible time of troubles– the Civil War– that came after it. In 1920, not far from here, steamboats were departing these shores taking with them those who left their Motherland and emigrated. Of course, most of them were Russian patriots and loved Russia in all sincerity, just like those who stayed behind to build a new country and what they hoped would be a better life. Covered in the blood of Russian soldiers, the Crimean soil remembers the pain of these events and will serve as an eternal symbol not only of the tragic fratricidal conflict, but, even more importantly, the reconciliation that followed and the triumph of historical truth and justice. The memorial complex in Sevastopol shows that Russia remembers and loves all its devoted sons and daughters no matter what side of the barricades they once were on, and that our country has recovered its historical unity. It is of course here, in Sevastopol, in Crimea, that one gets the keenest sense of this live, indissociable bond. Sevastopol and Crimea are now with Russia and will stay with it forever, because this was the expression of the sovereign, free and uncompromising will of our entire people. My sincere congratulations to the people of Sevastopol, Crimea and all the citizens of our beloved country, our Russia, on this holiday. Happy National Unity Day! Congratulations!"

Credit for sustaining such positive dynamics goes largely to our countries' regions. Many constituent entities of the Russian Federation, especially those in the Far East and Siberia, are actively engaged in joint work with Korean partners. Big bilateral projects are underway in natural gas extraction, energy, marine transport, automobile industry and shipbuilding, fisheries and agriculture, healthcare and innovative technologies. Interregional partnership clearly contributes to the economic, infrastructure and social progress of our two countries, expanding contacts between business communities and civil societies, as well as government ties.

We are holding today our final meeting in this series on strengthening and improving the Armed Forces. Today we will discuss the progress in equipping our army and navy with systems based on new physical principles. Developing unique laser, hypersonic, kinetic and other types of weapons was a huge breakthrough in military technology for Russia. It has significantly, many-fold boosted the capacity of the Russian Armed Forces ensuring a high level of Russian military security for many years and even decades to come and it helped strengthen our strategic parity. The development and production of these effective and innovative hi-tech weapons is a key development vector for our Armed Forces. Of course, it takes time, extra effort and funding because each particular model is the result of long hard work by thousands of scientists, engineers, programmers and other specialists. I have noted several times that the Russian military-industrial complex, our fundamental and applied science, have done a lot of groundwork in this area. Tests have convincingly confirmed the unique characteristics of the Peresvet laser systems, and the Avangard and Kinzhal hypersonic weapons. I would like to add that tests of the sea-based Tsirkon hypersonic cruise missile are nearing completion. During the tests, these missiles pointedly destroyed both land- and sea-based targets from submarines and surface ships in full conformity with their objectives. The Russian Navy will start receiving these missiles next year. Now it is particularly important to develop and introduce the technology needed for developing new hypersonic weapon systems, and more powerful lasers and robotic systems that will be capable of effectively countering potential military threats. Thus, they will further enhance our national security. I would like to emphasise a very important point. The use of artificial intelligence technology is of primary importance in developing these and other advanced weapons systems. We have talked about this at previous meetings. This technology should ensure a breakthrough in improving combat capabilities of weapons. This technology must be used more comprehensively in troop command and control, communications and data transmission, as well as in precision missile systems. It is no less important to introduce artificial intelligence technology when developing advanced robotics with higher autonomy, and to control drones and deep-water vessels. We need to fully reflect these priorities in the new State Armament Programme through 2033. The Defence Ministry is already drafting documents for an integral system of benchmark data for this. The main, fundamental goal in this respect is to make sure that the advanced weapons and equipment that will be produced and delivered to the troops under this programme will reliably protect Russia from potential threats. In general, we know all this: we will talk about it. Let's start. <…>"

We have learned to repel these attacks, and we are doing this effectively. Today, we have over 2,000 unmanned aircraft. It is necessary to continue working on them in the same intensive manner, just as we have been doing recently, and this involves the use of artificial intelligence and the most advanced achievements of technology and science.

I am convinced that the conservation of forests and other natural ecosystems is a key component of international efforts to address global warming and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. This topic fits organically into the multidimensional agenda of the Glasgow Climate Change Conference. By aiming to build a carbon-neutral economy by no later than 2060, Russia is relying, among other things, on the unique resource of forest ecosystems available to us, and their significant capacity to absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. After all, our country accounts for around 20 per cent of the world's forestland. We take the strongest and most vigorous measures to conserve it. We improve forest management, and fight illegal logging and forest fires. We are expanding reforestation areas. We have been consistently increasing funding for these purposes. Russia supports the draft joint declaration on forests and land-use proposed for approval at today's meeting. We expect its implementation to facilitate closer partnerships between all interested States in forest conservation. This will undoubtedly serve to fulfill the objectives of reducing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere set out in the Paris Agreement. I would like to wish all of us success and all the best. Thank you."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67051,Meeting with Defence Ministry leadership and defence industry heads,2021-11-01T15:20:00Z,Sochi,A new series of the President's meetings with Defence Ministry leaders and the defence industry heads began in Sochi.,"The first meeting centred on the Aerospace Forces and the Navy. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu in a separate report updated the meeting participants on the progress of COVID-19 vaccination in the Armed Forces. The meeting was also attended by Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces and First Deputy Defence Minister Valery Gerasimov, Deputy Defence Minister Alexei Krivoruchko, Commander-in-Chief of the Aerospace Forces Sergei Surovikin, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Nikolai Yevmenov, Commander of the Strategic Missile Forces Sergei Karakayev, Chief of the Main Operations Directorate of the General Staff and Deputy Chief of the General Staff Sergei Rudskoy, Chief of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff and Deputy Chief of the General Staff Igor Kostyukov, First Deputy Chief of the Main Operations Directorate of the General Staff Viktor Poznikhir, and Head of the Interbranch Research Directorate of the Main Operational Directorate of the General Staff Yevgeny Shmyrin. Also invited to attend were Deputy Prime Minister Yury Borisov, First Deputy Chairman of the Board of the Defence Industry Commission Andrei Yelchaninov, Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Oleg Ryazantsev, General Director of Rostec State Corporation Sergei Chemezov, General Director of Tactical Missiles Corporation Boris Obnosov and General Designer of Almaz-Antey Aerospace Defence Concern Pavel Sozinov. * * * Beginning of the meeting with the leadership of the Defence Ministry and defence companies President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues. We are starting another series of meetings dedicated to technological development and Armed Forces equipment. As always, the participants include leaders from the Defence Ministry and top defence companies. As we have stated on many occasions, this format makes it possible to comprehensively analyse on a regular basis the state of Russia's defence capability and, if needed, to promptly adjust and update plans for modernising the army and the navy, and to improve the defence companies' performance. Today, we will primarily consider a range of topics related to strengthening the Aerospace Forces, one of the most powerful, high-tech, and maneuverable branches of the modern Russian military. Russia's reliable protection from an aerospace attack and maintaining strategic parity directly depend on their combat readiness and technical equipment. We are all well aware that some of our foreign colleagues have not abandoned their attempts to undermine this parity, including by deploying elements of their global missile defence systems in the immediate vicinity of our borders. We cannot fail to notice these threats to Russia's security and we will respond appropriately and adequately to the situation. In this regard, I would like to note that in recent years, the Russian Armed Forces' aerospace defence capabilities have noticeably increased. Our missile attack warning system is functioning smoothly and effectively. Both of its components, the constellation of satellites in orbit and ground-based radar systems – guarantee the detection of potential ballistic missile launches. The system will determine their parameters in a timely manner and notify the military command and control centres. Under the state armament programme, over the past four years, 25 S-400 anti-aircraft missile systems and over 70 modern fighter jets have been produced, and more than 20 S-300 systems and 90 aircraft have been modernised. As a result, the country's critical military and industrial infrastructure is protected even more effectively now. We need to further improve aerospace defence. This need has been prompted by the leading countries' developing innovative strike weapons with advanced speed parameters. The general military-political situation also requires further effort, prompted partly by the increasing numbers of NATO flights close to Russia, and NATO ships with guided missiles appearing in the Baltic and Black Seas. Just recently, as you know, a US ship entered the Black Sea – it could be seen through binoculars or through the sight of our defence systems. US plans to deploy medium-range missiles in Europe are also well known, and that also poses a great danger and threat to us. Therefore, in accordance with the earlier adopted decisions, our troops must be supplied, in the next few years, with an additional more than 200 aircraft and 26 S-350 and S-400 anti-aircraft missile systems, as well as the first production prototype or first production models of the latest S-500 antiaircraft missile system. Generally, the current rates of reequipping the air and missile defence forces will make it possible to bring the level of modern hardware to at least 80 percent by 2025–2027. In the process, special attention must be paid to the development of the centralised air and space defence control system, the integration of the sub-systems of intelligence and warning of air or space attack into a single information space, and the deployment of advanced space systems. The updated air and space defence system must detect hypersonic and ballistic targets of all types at long distances and then be able to destroy them along the entire trajectory of their flight. In addition, the military-industrial complex must expedite the development rates of modern weapons for air and space defence, and quickly begin full-scale production using domestic hardware and components. Today, I would like to hear detailed reports on progress in these areas, on existing problems, and proposals on what we should adjust in the near future to guarantee the failsafe implementation of all our plans. One more extremely important goal is to provide the Russian Navy with modern equipment and weapons. In the past four years, the Navy has received 49 new warships and combat craft, nine coastal missile systems and ten aircraft. The programme to upgrade the fleet is making steady headway. In general, by 2027, the number of modern weapons should exceed 70 percent. The formation of shipborne strike groups operating in the near marine area is close to completion. The decisions made during the Sochi consultations and other meetings have made it possible to start increasing the construction of warships for the off-shore maritime and ocean zones. Over 30 of these warships are being built or modernised now. This includes a new class of ship – universal landing ships. The upgrading of the fleet is of crucial, strategic, national importance to us. This is why we are regularly taking part in the keel-laying ceremony of new ships – both surface ships and submarines. And we will continue to do so. I would like to add that Navy warships and vessels continuously take part in long distant patrols. They carry out operational and training missions and display the flag in the ocean and sea zones of importance to Russia. I would like to recall that in the 2000s, in the early 2000s, such patrols were episodic if not sporadic. Let me repeat, we need to continue the course of technically reequipping the fleet. I would like to draw your attention to several important points. First, we need to be more active in introducing advanced technology, equipment and materials; actually, this is obvious, but I will still make the point. This will improve the operational specifications of ships and submarines and create an opportunity to use new types of weapons. The second point. Considering the buildup of foreign navies with modern nuclear-powered submarines, aircraft carrying and strike ships, and unmanned ships, we must expedite the development of our naval aviation, primarily by supplying the Navy with advanced aircraft and air weapons and conducting a large-scale modernization of existing systems. I would like to hear today what is being done to resolve this task. Before we move to the issues on our agenda, I would like to hear a separate – brief, but separate – report on the vaccination of military personnel in the Armed Forces. I spoke recently with the Defence Minister and asked him to prepare this report. It is brief but I want to hear it today anyway. Go ahead, please. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu: Thank you. Mr President, in line with your instructions, we started planned vaccination at priority rates in July of last year. Today, 95 percent of military personnel, 70 percent of civilian workers and relatives of service members have been vaccinated. This has allowed us to have fairly high figures in reducing the coronavirus infection and fatality rates. On July 1, we began our planned revaccination programme. As of today, about 25–27 percent of military personnel have been revaccinated. Again, this is proceeding according to plan. To keep the pandemic under control, we increased the number of laboratories six times in 2020. Because of this, since last year, we have reduced the time for obtaining test results to two hours; we can receive test results in two hours in any place in the country. We have also put telemedicine on an around-the-clock schedule. Of course, all moderate to severe patients in our hospitals are monitored by doctors and receive consultations from leading specialists around the clock. As a result, today the incidence rate among Armed Forces personnel is half the national average. In 2021, the incidence rate is 44.5 percent lower than in 2020. As compared to 2020, we have reduced the demand for beds three-fold, so, this year we need three times fewer beds. Naturally, we are helping 27 regions in the Russian Federation in 136 of our hospitals. We are helping them with oxygen supplies (as you instructed last year and repeatedly said this year). We are providing various assistance, including hospitalization and the use of our laboratories. Compared to last year, vaccination has cut the COVID-19 mortality rate in half in the Armed Forces alone. It is 45 percent below the national average per 10,000 people. We have both military and civilian personnel and their relatives. We continue countering the coronavirus under our plan. Like last year, per your instructions, we are ready to deploy a hospital in any part of the country within three hours, minus, of course, travel time. We have nine hospitals at our disposal, complete with all the required equipment and personnel. Today, we are using our medical facilities from this number in Khakassia, in Moscow and Tula regions, in Abkhazia and a number of other regions in Russia where our medical personnel provide treatment, without equipment. We are ready to instantly fulfil your instructions. Vladimir Putin: I told the Prime Minister about this today, and his deputy, Tatyana Golikova, and the Health Minister. I have just spoken to all of them. We have a very difficult situation in Russia today, more than 40,000 infected [a day], this has never happened before. We definitely need to continue this effort, which is certainly extremely important for all Russians, and even more so for the Armed Forces – two or three times as important – because we absolutely need all of our military members in the service and in good health. The combat readiness of the Armed Forces depends on this. Therefore, I ask you to continue this work, and to continue to support civil medicine. If necessary, perhaps, you might want to use your construction capacity, because there is a need to continue building prefabricated medical facilities. I would also like to address my colleagues from industry. Perhaps, this concerns the Armed Forces to a lesser extent – I will explain in a minute – and the civilian sector, to a greater extent. Here is what I mean. We know that senior citizens have an increased risk of severe illness – this is an obvious fact today, and the mortality rate among that age group is several times higher than the national average, for the entire population. What I am saying, you have employees of different generations working at your enterprises, including the older generation – please keep this under review, including the observance of all the necessary precautions to prevent the spread of the disease. This certainly applies to the entire country, but now I am addressing those who are present at this meeting. On vaccination – vaccines can really protect from severe illness and death. True, new drugs are being developed, and I am sure we will be able to use them soon, I also spoke with my colleagues about this today, with those working on this; but still, the most universal and best way to protect yourself is to get vaccinated. And for the army – in fact, this concerns everyone, including the army – timely revaccination is necessary. I occasionally speak with my colleagues in countries where more than 60 percent of the population has been vaccinated, and they still cannot avoid a new outbreak. I asked them personally, what happened. They failed to start revaccinating on time, missed the moment – we must bear this in mind, too. Even when people get vaccinated, as the minister just said, we need to monitor what happens after that and make appropriate decisions and act on time. Let us get started. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67044,G20 Summit second session,2021-10-31T16:00:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region","Vladimir Putin took part, via videoconference, in the second working session of the heads of delegations from G20 member countries, invited states and international organisations.","The participants in the second session, dedicated to Climate Change and the Environment, discussed, in particular, sustainable development and the transition to a low-carbon economy. Following the summit, the G20 Rome Leaders' Declaration was adopted. The annual G20 Summit was held in Rome on October 30–31 under the auspices of Italy's Presidency in in-person format with the opportunity to connect via videoconference. At the venue, the Russian Federation was represented by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and Representative of the Russian President in the G20(Russia's G20 Sherpa) Svetlana Lukash. The G20 Summit focused on three interconnected priorities proposed by the Italian Presidency: People, Planet, Prosperity. Participants in the top-level meeting paid special attention to the restoration of the global economy, overcoming the coronavirus pandemic, counteracting climate change and the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. They discussed the most pressing issues such as ensuring broad access to vaccination, stabilising the key energy, commodities and financial markets, and improving progress in lowering the anthropogenic load on the climate and ecosystems. Participants in the summit set specific goals on improving international cooperation in digital transformation, transiting to a low-carbon economy, and reducing the social, economic and technological divide. They also reviewed practical efforts to counteract unfavourable trends amid growing poverty, hunger and unemployment.*** The Russian President's speech at the second working session of the G20 summit President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President of the G20 Mario Draghi, Colleagues, Indeed, the matters related to combatting climate change that we are discussing today are of the utmost importance and concern each and every one of us. Russia, like other countries, is experiencing– actually experiencing– the negative bearing of global warming, and here is why: we are faced with desertification and soil erosion, and we are especially worried about the thawing of the permafrost, which accounts for a significant part of Russia's territory. I would like to note that the average annual temperature in Russia is growing faster than around the globe, more than 2.5 times. It has increased by almost half a degree in the past 10 years. In the Arctic, as we all know, the warming is even faster. Naturally, our country is vigorously participating and taking the lead in international climate mitigation and stabilisation efforts. We faithfully comply with all our obligations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. We are consistently implementing a policy to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions and are taking steps to improve energy efficiency in our national economy, to modernise our power generation industry, and reduce associated gas discharge from oil production. The low-carbon power industry is growing at a rapid pace in Russia. The share of energy generated from practically carbon-free sources such as nuclear power plants, hydroelectric dams, wind and solar power plants exceeds 40 percent today, or 86 if we include natural gas, which is the lowest-carbon fuel among hydrocarbons. This is one of the best indicators in the world. According to international experts, Russia is among global decarbonisation leaders. In the past 20 years, Russia's economy's carbon intensity has been declining by an average of 2.7 percent annually, which is better than across the globe and even better than in the G7 countries. Recently, we decided to implement a new programme to improve energy efficiency for the period until 2035. This programme will make an important contribution to our achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 at the latest. We have publicly announced this commitment. Moreover, we do not just intend to achieve carbon neutrality; we are also going to make sure that in the next three decades, the accumulated volume of net greenhouse gas emissions in Russia will be even lower than that of our neighbours and colleagues in the European Union. This is a perfectly achievable objective for Russia. We hope that together with our partners we will make long-term plans and prioritise them in our energy sectors, relying on the principles of technological neutrality, while objectively taking into account the carbon footprint of various types of power generation. In particular, I would like to mention the carbon footprint of solar energy, which, according to research findings, is four times higher than that of nuclear energy. It is important that the international community's efforts be directed toward supporting primarily the most effective environmental projects. It is our suggestion that experts begin ranking such projects according to their results as measured by how much greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is reduced for every dollar invested. It cannot be ruled out that some of the projects included in the ranking, such as projects to preserve, for instance, forests in Russia and Latin America, will turn out to be more effective than investments in renewable energy in other countries. I would also like to underscore that, in our opinion, it is not enough to simply reduce emissions to solve the global warming problem. It is equally important to increase the absorption of greenhouse gases, and here Russia, as well as in a number of other countries, has tremendous potential in terms of the absorbing potential of its forests, the tundra, agricultural lands, seas and swamps. To achieve full use of this amazing potential, we plan to significantly improve the quality of forest management, increase reforestation areas, expand areas of untouched nature, and introduce new agricultural technologies. Climate projects in Russia will also create new opportunities for international cooperation for many decades to come, and of course, they will make a significant contribution to global efforts on the climate track. Overall, we believe that when implementing climate and environmental initiatives, it is important for the G20 to take the lead in drafting uniform,– and I emphasise– fair and, no less importantly, transparent rules for climate regulation. These rules should be based on mutually recognised verification and monitoring methods for greenhouse gas emissions and absorption. And most importantly, climate change should be addressed in a comprehensive manner, closely linked with steps to promote economic growth and, as my colleagues have already noted, people's living standards. Thank you for your attention."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67040,First session of the G20 Summit,2021-10-30T14:10:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow","The President addressed, via videoconference, the first working session of the heads of delegations of the G20 member countries, invited states and international organisations.","The theme of the session is The Global Economy and Global Health. The agenda includes global economic recovery, ensuring digital transformation and the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, overcoming the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic, strengthening healthcare systems, and implementing universal vaccination. The Summit was held on October 30–31 under Italy's chairmanship.*** Speech at the first session of the G20 Summit President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Chairman Draghi, colleagues, I shall speak on the topics that were put forward by Italy for today's discussion: the global economy and global health. I should say straight away that this theme largely concerns what we are all working on, and Russia's position, as I saw from the previous speeches, mainly overlaps with what our colleagues spoke about here. Last year the economic authorities of the G20 member countries and many other countries decided to significantly increase their budget deficits against the backdrop of the deep crisis caused by the pandemic, which allowed for launching global economic recovery. However, such extraordinary measure accompanied by securities buyouts by central banks should be limited in time. In fact, this is what was said here earlier. In Russia, for example, the budget deficit rose to four percent of the GDP in 2020 against the background of large-scale support measures for the population, small and medium-sized businesses, and the healthcare system. This allowed us to achieve a recovery of the labour market. In the current year we have normalised our macroeconomic policy to the point that the budget will be in the surplus. We have not only achieved that, but we have also tightened out monetary policy. Overall, the situation in G20 countries is slightly different. While in 2017–2019, the average budget deficit was around 3.8 percent of GDP, it grew to 11.2 percent in 2020 amidst the pandemic. This year, although slightly lower, the budget deficit remains rather high at 8.7 percent. I would like to note that the United States will account for 40 percent of the G20 countries' budget deficits combined in 2020–2021. I am saying this because we all understand very well that the state of the US economy is what determines the state of the global economy. Excessive stimulation has resulted in the general lack of stability, growing prices of financial assets and goods in certain markets such as energy, food, etc. Once again, significant budget deficits in the developed economies are the main cause of these developments. With these deficits persisting, there is a risk of high global inflation in the medium term, which not only increases the risk of lower business activity but reinforces and exacerbates the inequality that was also mentioned today. That is why it is important to prevent aggravating stagflation and instead do what can be done to normalise the budgetary and monetary policies, improve the quality of demand management in the economy and update economic priorities– and primarily prioritise overcoming inequality and boosting public welfare. We have always welcomed and continue to welcome the efforts of the G20 to support the poorest countries. I agree with those who have already said that sustainable growth of the global economy is, of course, impossible unless this issue is addressed. By the way, the developed countries, including many of the G20 states, have recently been affected by inequality and poverty. It is important to deal with this problem by means of economic and budgetary policy. I would like to point out that, despite the decisions of the G20, vaccines and other vital resources are still not available to all the countries in need. Among other reasons, this is due to competition, which is dishonest, in my opinion, as well as protectionism and the fact that certain countries, including G20 countries, are not ready for mutual recognition of the vaccines and vaccination certificates. There is an urgent need for the World Health Organisation to expedite the pre-qualification of new vaccines and drugs– that is, to evaluate their quality, safety and effectiveness. I am convinced that the sooner this is accomplished, the easier it will be to resume global business activity, including tourism, which has been hit the hardest. I propose instructing healthcare ministries of the G20 to address the matter of mutual recognition of national vaccination certificates within the shortest possible term. Experts believe that COVID-19 will continue to be a threat for a long time. I think WHO representatives will speak about this today as well. Considering that the virus continues mutating, we should develop mechanisms to boost vaccines promptly and consistently. I would like to remind you that Russia was the first country in the world to register a COVID-19 vaccine, Sputnik V. Currently, this vaccine is approved in 70 countries with a total population of over 4 billion people, and it has demonstrated high safety and effectiveness. In addition to the double-dose Sputnik V, we also developed and widely use a single-dose vaccine, Sputnik Light, which can boost the effect of other vaccines. We are working with our colleagues from Europe on having this vaccine available there and offering it to our partners. Large-scale efforts to counter the coronavirus require higher-quality and more affordable medical care in all countries and, therefore, wider international cooperation in healthcare. In view of the current situation, the role of the World Health Organisation is becoming increasingly important and its activities, of course, deserve our full support. It is unacceptable to make attempts to impinge upon the prerogatives of the WHO, which operates under the aegis of the United Nations. In this context, I fully agree with the President of France, Mr Macron. In addition to the pandemic, other crises on the regional energy markets have shown once again how essential it is for the modern world to have a stable and reliable energy sector. I would like to say a few words about this. Supplying affordable energy to consumers is extremely important and our colleagues have just talked about it. I would like to add that the stability of global energy markets directly depends on the responsible conduct of all market participants, both energy producers and energy consumers, with due account for each party's long-term interests. Russia supports having an in-depth pragmatic discussion of this matter, based on purely economic considerations. Colleagues, Creating conditions for an equal and non-discriminatory cooperation for all nations is the main prerequisite for a steady and long-term recovery of the global economy, higher quality of life and better public welfare. As we understand, this is the key goal for the G20 as a forum of the world's leading economies. Thank you very much."

During these years the Service has become a full-fledged financial intelligence service in the direct sense of this word. First, I would like to congratulate you and your staff on this occasion. Head of the Federal Service for Financial Monitoring Yury Chikhanchin Chikhanchin YuryHead of the Federal Service for Financial Monitoring: Thank you very much. Vladimir Putin: And, of course, we will talk about current issues. Yury Chikhanchin: Indeed, Mr President, in the past 20 years the Russian anti-money laundering service has trodden a thorny path. In 2000, the Russian Federation was blacklisted by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering(FATF). This is an intergovernmental organisation that counters money laundering and financing of terrorism. A law, the third version, was signed in 2001. Thank you very much for your support on this. In 2002 we were removed from the FATF blacklist and became a full-fledged FATF member in 2003. In 2019, Russia delivered a report at a FATF plenary session, and Russia's national system against money laundering was recognised as one of the best. I would like to say that we have accomplished a lot during this period. More than 150 laws have been adopted. They tailored Russian law to international standards and requirements, settled the nature of relations between the parties to the anti-laundering system, and determined what transactions and financial instruments the state needed to control today. Naturally, financial institutions, including banks, leasing and insurance companies, and specifically attorneys and notaries etc., are one of the main groups we work with in the anti-laundering system. And our task, in cooperation with the Central Bank, oversight and law enforcement bodies, the General Prosecutor's Office, the Interior Ministry and the Federal Security Service(FSB) was to ensure, first, that all parties to the anti-laundering system follow the laws in a consistent manner; second, to improve their law abidance, and third, to create mechanisms to prevent""dirty"" money from entering the financial system, primarily, banking. I should say that we have managed to resolve many issues. I can say that since the law was passed, the number of financial sectors has increased by 4.5 times while the number of participants grew tenfold: today there are 85,000 entities who submit reports to Rosfinmonitoring, operating in the legal framework. Most importantly, compliance with the law of all financial institutions has doubled. However, there were those who were not getting along with law. Their number has decreased threefold– some of them had their licences revoked, others just closed down whereas some became law-abiding businesses. Countering the shadow sector was one of our priorities. We have indeed managed to lower the shadow sector volumes in cooperation with the Central Bank, the Federal Security Service, the Interior Ministry, the Prosecutor's Office, the Taxation Service and the Customs Service. The volume of suspicious transactions went down by five times while the number of shadow scheme participants decreased fourfold. Work is underway in the regions. These slides show how the regions are being cleaned up and transgress from the red zone into the yellow and green ones. We undertook a lot of efforts to lower the attractiveness of shadow services. Initially the shadow services– cashing out, withdrawal of monetary funds– cost 1–1.5 percent whereas today the market price rose to 20 percent, with 40 percent on crypto currencies, so these are the costs. Earlier the shadow venues amounted to about 100–150 billion whereas now they went down to 2–2.5. The lifespan of shadow venues was 5–6 years, while today such venues exist one year at the most and then close down. I have already mentioned that increasing the level of law abidance was one of the priorities. In this regard, to relieve pressure on business, we switched over to a distance monitoring mechanism, that is we have practically given up on-site inspections, cutting them by 15 times. Meanwhile, distance monitoring went up by 27 times. It means we are working online through the system of client accounts. Here are some other areas we have managed to improve. I reported to you earlier that there were high risks at the Russian Post and mobile operators as there were a great number of shadow schemes there. As of today, there are only some isolated cases there. But I have to say that money laundering schemes have become more sophisticated. Previously only one bank was operating on the venue, nowadays a group of banks and several other companies of a different kind can be operating such as leasing companies, microfinance organisations and notaries. It means the criminals are trying to spread their activities across several sectors to hinder their identification. However, we have also learned to look for them with the help of digital technology together with the Central Bank, the FSB and the Interior Ministry. Vladimir Putin: Is the work within the EAEU becoming easier, too? Yury Chikhanchin: Yes, we are also active here: we have a council of heads of financial intelligence where all these matters are being discussed. Regarding the shadow sector, we think that the key thing we managed to achieve is basically pushing them out of the Russian territory. Most shadow venues have just moved to other jurisdictions, that is, they operate outside of Russia. Large-scale work has been done on searching and returning stolen money, primarily legalised funds. I must say that the arrests of such funds increased threefold whereas the amount of funds returned grew by six times. But crucially, the number of economic entities involved in the shadow economy has decreased: the number of rogue companies by around 4.5 times, withdrawal of money abroad by six times, while the""transit"" with the use of an intermediary company by five times. I would like to mention another area: the criminal world began looking for new sectors to be used– those that are improperly regulated or, let's say, lack an appropriate monitoring system. In this respect we have problems with notaries, labour disputes commission and courts. We have more or less rectified, together with the Supreme Court, the Prosecutor General's Office, the FSB and the Interior Ministry, the situation with courts, and the curve is coming down. However, work is ongoing with notaries and the labour disputes commission. Vladimir Putin: How is the commission involved in this? Yury Chikhanchin: What is the labour disputes commissions' guideline? The staff of an organisation applies to them with a claim that some organisation allegedly owes them money. Prior to that, money is pumped up into that organisation. Following the decision of the labour disputes commission, the bank writes off the funds in favour of concrete individuals. The organisation is a fake one but it has to be proved, it requires a resolution. We are looking for a way out of this situation together with law enforcement and legislative bodies. Meanwhile, this method is being actively employed. Which areas need improving in this respect? First, we lack limitations on using cash. The problem is that practically nobody checks the legality of the money. The second problem is insufficient regulation of the area of cryptocurrency circulation. As of today, there are over 10,000 kinds of cryptocurrencies in the world, including those used by Russians. And there is a really big problem– that of confiscating assets that are located abroad. We have learnt to track those assets but, unfortunately, we are unable to retrieve them. Large efforts have been made with the Presidential Executive Office and anti-corruption commissions of the ministries and agencies, first of all in the law enforcement agencies, the FSB, the Interior Ministry and the Prosecutor General's Office so as to cut the involvement of officials in corruption activities. I can say that the number of suspicious transactions involving such persons decreased by three times while the use of rogue companies by such persons– by six times. Improvement has been achieved in such areas as the housing and utilities, fuel and energy sector, agro-industrial complex, where risks have decreased by 1.5–2 times. I would like to say a few words about countering the laundering of drug proceeds. A great deal of work has been done here under the State Anti-Drug Committee jointly with the Interior Ministry, the FSB, the Prosecutor's Office and the Customs Service. We can say that we have squeezed most transactions involving drug payment clearance out of the banking sector. They are gone, but they moved to new technologies when rapid payment systems and cryptocurrencies appeared. The number of cases investigated by us and law enforcement agencies is growing significantly. But we continue working and we managed to achieve some progress. For example, we managed to decriminalise, to a certain degree, the operations of online stores that have been distributing drugs in the country, primarily in the Moscow Region as well as in the Sverdlovsk, Voronezh and Tula regions. The number of criminal cases grows in the areas where we are trying to find the financial component related to drugs. Crucially, we stopped the activities of 10 transnational criminal groups who were importing and selling drugs here in our country or in European countries. Those are big international investigations. Vladimir Putin: You spoke about housing and utilities, the fuel and energy sector, and agriculture. What about the fishing industry? Yury Chikhanchin: There is still a problem in the fishing and timber industries. This problem persists but we are working on it. I should note that we have many potential solutions that can help us remove this problem from the system. As I reported to you earlier, we have been dealing with this in the Far East. Vladimir Putin: You mean getting rid of criminals? Yury Chikhanchin: Yes, this problem exists and it is our biggest problem. I highlighted it here. Next time I will make sure to report to you on the outcome. Vladimir Putin: Timber and fishing industries. Yury Chikhanchin: Yes, these are currently the two most crime-ridden industries. Specialised working groups and competent agencies are working on this problem to fix the situation. Vladimir Putin: Good. Yury Chikhanchin: I would like to say a few words about monitoring and overseeing budget spending. As for the instruction you gave us jointly with the Defence Ministry and the Central Bank, we tested the monitoring system on a state defence order. And now, in cooperation with the Central Bank, the Federal Security Service, the Interior Ministry and the Prosecutor's Office, we have launched a monitoring mechanism for contracts, customers and vendors, and for evaluating the regions. This project has made contract performance more transparent as dishonest vendors have been removed. Most importantly, we have ensured that budget funds are spent as planned. If you are interested in statistics, I can say that questionable cashing-out operations involving budget funds have reduced sixfold, and transactions involving shell companies– also sixfold. But most importantly, economic entities dealing with public funds have become four times more law-abiding compared to economic entities operating in other spheres. So, we are trying to keep the public sector in check. Vladimir Putin: What about siphoning money off abroad, does this continue? Yury Chikhanchin: The siphoning off continues but on a much smaller scale. We have taken the budget money under strict control. The treasury and the banking sector are working hard. We are working with Promsvyazbank– here we are trying to… I would like to say a few words about national projects. Last time, I reported to you that a number of national projects, including Education, Safe and Quality Roads, and Healthcare, had been facing serious risks. Now the situation has started to change. You can see the downward trend on the chart. Speaking about Healthcare in particular, I can add that shell companies and the scope of their involvement has reduced four times, with a definite effect on the medication and medical services pricing policy. A positive process is underway in some regions as they move from the grey to the green area, which you can see on the chart. According to the data from the Office of the Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoy to the Northwestern Federal District, thanks to the system for combatting money laundering, around 30 socially significant facilities have been put into operation recently, including schools, kindergartens and other facilities. We are actively working with Promsvyazbank and helping it to set up a risk assessment centre similar to ours. That will allow them to better understand the financial stability of their customers and, most importantly, make sure that financial transactions are transparent. What problems do we currently have? There are two major problems: one is determining the procedure for price structure disclosure because sometimes, contracts are identical but prices differ, and we are working on this. The other problem is the limit of profitability for specific contracts. We are working with government agencies and Promsvyazbank to find a solution because price is the key. Vladimir Putin: This is an extremely important question. Yury Chikhanchin: We are constantly looking for a solution. Vladimir Putin: We will have meetings in Sochi and will again discuss this particular issue– the cost of medical goods. Yury Chikhanchin: It is a problem. There are identical contracts but differing prices. I would like to say a few words about action against financing terrorism. We are taking very serious measures together with the National Anti-Terrorism Committee, the Federal Security Service, the Interior Ministry and the Investigative Committee. It should be noted that recently, we have stopped the financial activity of over 15,000 terrorists, including 850 foreign nationals. Currently, almost 100 percent of assets of all individuals with connections to terrorism get blocked. The number of criminal cases involving both terrorism and financial charges is growing. We continue to take measures to ban foreign nationals directly involved in terrorism, from entering our country. We are taking measures to prevent the funding the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Our database currently includes over 250 foreign individuals and legal entities that are involved in trading such weapons. Vladimir Putin: As concerns terrorist organisations, I know that video games can be used for transferring money. Yury Chikhanchin: Yes, there is a method using in-game currencies. Let's say there is an online shooter and players pay for weapons or for a player's assets, etc., when in fact, the money goes to terrorists. It is a serious problem and right now, we are working with the Federal Security Service to model these terrorists' behaviour with respect to the money they receive. There are two problems here: one is terrorists acting alone, who are very important to us because they are using new funding systems(self-funding or else), and the other is youth movements because they have new tools and ways to conduct new kinds of financial transactions. The international community is, of course, paying utmost attention to Afghanistan. We are also monitoring the developments there along with our colleagues from the Federal Security Service and financial intelligence. We are monitoring migration traffic to expose funds made from drug trading and organised criminal activity. I should thank you for your support for establishing an inter-agency commission to counter terrorism funding. This commission has the authority to freeze assets in an extra-judicial procedure. And in the past five years, we have frozen the assets of more than 2,000 people. Other CIS countries are taking similar measures. We continue to improve the operation of our risk assessment centre. You have visited the centre yourself. There are several divisions. One division focuses on developing a single methodology for assessing the risk of crime and, specifically, money laundering. By now, we have brought together almost 25 ministries and agencies to cooperate, and we are pooling resources– we have over 100 sources to investigate this type of activity. Most importantly, we have determined the zones of highest risk, which are the budget, drugs, credit and finance, and several others. For communication, we use'user accounts' which helps us to quickly share information on risks and make decisions. I would like to tell you about cooperation between agencies. There is a good cooperation mechanism in the form of an inter-agency working group on preventing illegal financial transactions. The working group was established as per your instruction and it is headed by the Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office. The working group comprises 15 ministries and agencies. Some 150 laws have been adopted thanks to its efforts, and not only to counter money laundering. The working group deals with many issues such as eliminating risks for high-risk sectors(for example, precious metals and stones, gambling), developing a common strategy for dealing with sham platforms, for controlling budget spending, etc. We are working on creating an international risk assessment centre. You supported this decision and the Government provided funds. Next year, we are finishing this project. As of today, we have developed common information resources for the CIS countries, communication channels are operating with specific countries. This is the general approach we are taking with this. I would like to say a few words about the International Financial Security Olympiad. Allow me to give you a brochure. This year, as you instructed, we organised the first International Financial Security Olympiad for school and university students. The participants included Russian school students from the eighth to tenth grades and university students from Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. They competed in several areas of knowledge, including economy and finance, law, international law and cybersecurity. The Government set up an organising committee headed by Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko. The organising committee included representatives of all relevant ministries and agencies. The competitions were created in cooperation with the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, the Ministry of Education, the Bank of Russia, our international training centre, the International Network Institute as well as several universities, including the Peoples' Friendship University of Russia and National Research Nuclear University MEPhI. We also got our partners involved, including Sberbank, VTB, Rosselkhozbank, Promsvyazbank, Gazprombank, Rostec, Rosatom and Almaz-Antey. The Olympiad consisted of several stages. During the first stage, we held a nationwide lesson for school students, and almost 1.5 million took part with teachers giving them lessons, using a special teaching methodology, about financial security of an individual, of a state, of society, and about international financial. The second stage was about shortlisting: we received 31,000 applications for participation from school and university students representing seven countries, and we selected 500 individuals who then took part in a qualification round at Sirius. Here, I would like to thank you for supporting Sirius. Sirius not only provided space for this competition but was largely involved in organising it. Unfortunately, only 400 out of 500 participants were able to attend in person because of the pandemic. They represented eight countries, including one student from India, who won one of the prizes. I will quote some interesting statistics. Two hundred of the participants visited Sochi for the first time. For some of them, it was the first flight in their lives. For practically all school students, it was the first trip to a different city without their parents. Vladimir Putin: Did everything go well? No problems? Yury Chikhanchin: I would like to say a huge thank you to those who helped us, especially the Federal Service for the Oversight of Consumer Protection and Welfare, because the total number of people present was around 700, and we managed to keep everybody healthy. Only two schoolchildren got sick, both with mild symptoms. I would like to thank my colleagues from other agencies, the Interior Ministry, the National Guard, the Federal Security Service, the Administration of the Krasnodar Territory and the Sochi Mayor's Office. The Olympiad programme also included panel discussions, workshops and meetings with representatives of government bodies, educational institutions and industrial partners. Rosfinmonitoring and our international training centre created games specifically for this event. A specialised UN committee, FATF(Financial Action Task Force) Executive Secretary and a specialised committee of the Council of Europe sent their greetings to the participants. All heads of financial intelligence agencies from the CIS attended. We held a meeting together. We also held a board meeting of the International Network Institute that comprises over 40 universities in Russia and abroad. The Olympiad received high praise and everybody supported Russia's initiative to hold this competition on an annual basis. The programme also included cultural, sports events and concerts by the St Petersburg House of Music and the Astrakhan Philharmonic. It was a very eventful week for children. This is what we have done so far and what we plan to do. We are ready to continue as long as we have your support. Vladimir Putin: Thank you."

Thank you for accepting our invitation to visit Russia, despite the difficult epidemiological situation. Finland is our reliable partner and a close neighbour. Next year, we will mark 30 years of the fundamental treaty that serves as the basis of current relations between Russia and Finland. Of course, we will discuss the entire scope of our relations today. But first, I would like to note that, despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, this year we can overcome, to a large extent, the economic damage that our relations have sustained due to COVID-19. Russia-Finland trade has grown by 21 percent year on year. Both exports and imports have seen balanced growth. We continue to work on large projects. The intergovernmental commission has resumed its work. Unfortunately, the tourist industry has suffered heavy losses. However, we have already resumed flights between Russia and Finland. I hope that by the end of the year, we will be able to resume railway service as well. We continue our contacts in humanitarian sphere– unfortunately, still online. Nevertheless, this work continues. I am pleased to note that Russia remains among the top trade and economic partners of Finland. Mr President, welcome. President of Finland Sauli Niinistö Niinistö SauliPresident of Finland(retranslated): Thank you. I am very pleased to have this opportunity after a two-year break. We have all gone through something completely unexpected and I hope we are moving into the future. Indeed, we are neighbours and have much in common but we have been kept apart by the pandemic. It is a good thing we have held this session of the intergovernmental commission and had a constructive discussion. Indeed, it is a pity our citizens travel less across the border. I hope we will return to the previous scale as soon as possible. It is good we have an opportunity to discuss various issues. We have a wide range of items on the global agenda, including climate change. It is very useful for us, residents of small nations, to hear what people from larger countries think. I would like to thank you once again for this opportunity. Vladimir Putin: Thank you for mentioning the issues linked with environmental protection. The fact that we are neighbours matters a great deal because the implementation of the requirements that the international community is drafting now to counter climate change will largely depend on our concerted efforts. As Russian experts are telling me, our positions are very close to the views of our Finnish colleagues. In this context, I would also like to say that Russia will hold the Presidency in the Arctic Council through to 2023. I know that Finland has always paid much attention to cooperation in the Arctic. I hope that today we will be able to talk about this as well. Sauli Niinistö: We have one more issue in common. In the context of climate change, forests are becoming an increasingly important resource and today we have an opportunity to discuss forest-related problems. I wish you every success during your Presidency in the Arctic Council. Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much. <…>"

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67016,Meeting on developing Yamal Peninsula resource potential,2021-10-27T18:40:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region","Vladimir Putin held a meeting, via videoconference, on developing the resource potential of the Yamal Peninsula.","Taking part in the meeting were Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, Presidential Aide Maxim Oreshkin, Chairman of the Gazprom Board Alexei Miller, and Chairman of the NOVATEK Board Leonid Mikhelson. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues. Today, we will review a number of advanced projects for the development of the Russian fuel-and-energy sector and the gas segment. We regularly hold these discussions and this is very important, especially against the backdrop of the current developments in the world energy market. As you know, the situation remains very unstable. Primarily, I am referring to the European natural gas market where prices on so-called spot, short-term contracts exceed a thousand dollars per thousand cubic metres, while the gas reserves in European underground storage are significantly below average for the past five years. We have discussed the reasons for this situation, and I have spoken about it too. It is due to a reduction in Europe's own gas production, and cuts in LNG supplies to European markets, primarily from the United States. They have removed a substantial amount of gas from European markets. Incidentally, Gazprom made up for this and even supplied more gas. It is important to maintain sustainable, reliable energy cooperation. Gazprom is carrying out its long-term agreements with the European countries in full. Mr Miller, when do you plan to complete filling up the Russian underground gas storage facilities? Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller: Mr President, we plan to finish pumping gas into the underground storage facilities by November 1. The target is 72.6 billion cubic metres of gas. However, given that you have made a decision on days off, during which there will definitely be a decrease in consumption on the domestic market, we believe that it is advisable to continue to pump this weekend. This will allow us to reliably increase gas distribution to our consumers in the winter. Our pumping this year was carried out in a very intensive manner. The previous winter was cold and the spring was also fairly cool for a long time, and Gazprom set an all-time high in the volume of natural gas extracted from its underground storage facilities: we took out 10 billion cubic metres more, 60 billion cubic metres, in all. So, we pumped gas into our underground storage facilities this summer, and then in September and October in a very intensive manner. But Europe also set a record in withdrawing gas from its underground storage facilities at 66 billion cubic metres of gas. Unlike us today, Mr President, as you noted, they are significantly behind the level they have had over the past five years. Vladimir Putin: When do you plan to finish pumping to our underground storage facilities? Alexei Miller: Mr President, on November 8. We will achieve the target indicator of 72.6 billion cubic metres by November 1, and will fully complete the pumping on November 8. Vladimir Putin: To my knowledge, Gazprom also owns underground gas storage facilities in Europe. Alexei Miller: Yes, Mr President, we have underground storage facilities in Europe, including Austria and Germany. Vladimir Putin: What is the state of pumping into these UGS facilities? Alexei Miller: At present, the volume of gas in these underground storage facilities is insignificant, literally very, very low, a little under 190,000 cubic metres of gas. Vladimir Putin: Mr Miller, all right, after you complete the pumping of gas into Russia's underground storage facilities by or on November 8, I would like you to start consistent and planned work on increasing the amount of gas in your underground depots in Europe – in Austria and Germany. As we both understand, this will make it possible to fulfil our contractual commitments in a reliable, stable and consistent manner and to supply our European partners with gas in the autumn and winter. In addition, this will create a favourable situation, at any rate, a better situation in the European energy market in general. Alexei Miller: Mr President, this is what we will do. As soon as we complete pumping gas into the underground storage tanks in the Russian Federation, we will start pumping Gazprom gas into the underground storage facilities in Europe. There is no doubt that, as you said, this will make gas supplies more reliable and stable in the autumn and winter. Vladimir Putin Fine, do this, and keep me informed on your progress. The main goal for us is to fully supply gas at stable prices to our domestic customers – to individuals, the housing and utilities sector, industry and other sectors. These supplies must be planned for the long-term perspective, with due account of our ambitious plans to provide the regions with gas – this is also important, this is also one of our priorities. To ensure stable gas supplies both inside the country and to our foreign partners, the Russian fuel-and-energy complex is carrying out long-term development plans, putting into operation new fields and creating gas provinces, and we are doing all this in a timely manner. As I said in the beginning, today we will review these projects, including those on further developing the resources on the Yamal Peninsula. Importantly, the Yamal gas production centre is playing a key role in developing Russia's gas industry in the 21st century. Gas reserves, Gazprom's gas reserves alone exceed 20 trillion cubic metres. The total gas reserves in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Area are over 50 trillion cubic metres. Large-scale projects are being successfully implemented on the Yamal Peninsula; the largest field, Bovanenkovskoye, is being developed. Gas will be produced here for many decades, for 100 years, perhaps even longer. Unique technical solutions are being tested in the harsh Arctic conditions – unique for Russia and the international gas industry alike. The efficiency of the technologies has been proven by the commissioning of new wells and the Bovanenkovo-Ukhta-2 gas pipeline. In addition, with the participation of our foreign partners, projects for LNG production have been launched in Yamal. The Yamal LNG plant with a capacity of 19 million tonnes per year is operational; the Arctic LNG-2, which will annually produce almost 20 million tonnes of LNG, is under construction. The Arctic port of Sabetta has been built from scratch to service these centres. These and other projects to develop the Russian Arctic will make it possible to meet demand on the domestic and international markets for the long run, and will make a large contribution to ensuring Eurasian energy security. Here I want to emphasise one very important thing. Prices on global energy markets are high, and it is necessary to take advantage of this fact as much as possible not only for expanding the industry, but also for developing the production regions and creating new jobs and high-tech companies. So, along with investment in developing the fields, it is necessary to concentrate on building centres for deep processing of raw materials in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Area. It is important to invest in infrastructure, including transport, including such large and significant projects as the Northern Latitudinal Railway, railway accesses to the port of Sabetta, and further development of the Northern Sea Route. I am now addressing not only the management of Gazprom and NOVATEK who are present here, but other production companies as well: you must get more involved in this work and invest in infrastructure in the common interests of developing Yamal. To reiterate, this will create the foundation for the confident, high-quality, and long-term development of this strategically important region of Russia. Let us begin our discussion. Mr Novak, you have the floor. <…>"

The President signed an executive order on her appointment as Presidential Commissioner for Children's Rights.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Ms Lvova-Belova. Maria Lvova-Belova Lvova-Belova MariaPresidential Commissioner for Children's Rights : Good afternoon, Mr President. Vladimir Putin: Ms Lvova-Belova, when did you become a member of the Federation Council? Maria Lvova-Belova: I became a member of the Federation Council from Penza Region a year ago. Vladimir Putin: Ms Lvova-Belova, you have such a big family. How many children do you have? Maria Lvova-Belova: Nine children – I gave birth to four and adopted five. Thirteen young people with disabilities are under foster care but they do not live with me. They are part of my assisted living projects. Vladimir Putin: How do you cope with all this? I am referring to your community tasks as well. Maria Lvova-Belova: Mothers with many children are used to multitasking. Vladimir Putin: What among all the things you do and have done do you like most? Maria Lvova-Belova: Mr President, this is, of course, work with families in hardship, orphans, and young people with disabilities. I like this work and consider it important. I understand that if I have an opportunity to take part in their lives, I am very happy to do this. Vladimir Putin: Ms Lvova-Belova, you also have broad experience of large-scale public work and, of course, the family upbringing of your own children. Naturally, the position of a commissioner on children's rights provides its holder with an opportunity to use all their knowledge, skills and experience to achieve serious, meaningful results for a large number of families and children. As I understand it, you are ready for this work. Maria Lvova-Belova: Mr President, I appreciate your trust. It is truly a great honour for me. I have been involved in protecting children's rights for 15 years now, which has given me a lot of experience, and it is a personal story for me as well. I understand there will be areas that are new to me, and I will need to get familiar with them, but I am convinced that my track record of working on the ground with socially vulnerable groups, large families and orphans and, of course, my experience in working at the Federation Council under the leadership of Valentina Matviyenko will help me succeed. Plus, I have a good working relationship with Anna Kuznetsova. I think it is crucial to preserve the best practices that have been developed during this time and keep moving forward. It is also important to focus on protecting children's rights to family, education and health, and to create an equal playing field for all children regardless of their social status, place of residence or health, and to support large families. So, Mr President, if you allow me, if you trust me with it, I will, of course, take up this job with great pleasure. I cannot help but share my personal story with you. When I was 15, I was at a hospital with my younger brother. It was the first time I had seen an abandoned baby, it was in the ward next to ours. It was so little, so defenceless lying there on this bare plastic cover. Back then, as I stood next to this box, I vowed that when I grew up, I would do everything I could to make sure that every child in Russia has proper care, support and the attention of the adults. And I believe that this is the mission of the Commissioner for Children's Rights. Vladimir Putin: There is much to do here, and this is a noble cause, so I wish you every success from the bottom of my heart. Maria Lvova-Belova: Thank you, Mr President. I would like to ask for a meeting with you two months from now. I would like to delve into this work now, and in two months I will be able to discuss my vision and my goals for the near future in more detail. Vladimir Putin: All right, this is what we will do. Good luck. Maria Lvova-Belova: Thank you very much."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67010,East Asia Summit,2021-10-27T15:00:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region","The President addressed, via videoconference, the 16th East Asia Summit.","The 2021 East Asia Summit was held under the chairmanship of Brunei Darussalam. The participants discussed the economic recovery of the Asia-Pacific Region and overcoming the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. At the end of the session, the participants approved a package of documents. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Majesty, colleagues, I would like to begin by expressing my gratitude to His Majesty Sultan of Brunei Darussalam for organising this event. The East Asia Summits provide a good opportunity to discuss the situation in the Asia-Pacific Region, map out possible solutions to the most challenging problems and coordinate measures to maintain peace and stability and to strengthen mutually beneficial multilateral cooperation. Our common region has indeed become one of the most dynamic global centres of political, business and investment activity. At the same time, it is facing serious challenges and threats in terms of security, and economic and social development, which have been augmented by the coronavirus during the past two years. Therefore, it is quite logical that this summit is focusing on the struggle against the pandemic and efforts to overcome its consequences, as well as the implementation of the joint Statement on Strengthening Collective Capacity in Epidemics Prevention and Response, which was adopted at Russia's initiative. In this context, we are certainly ready to exchange experience with interested countries on the practical aspects of combatting infectious diseases. We could also expand the training programme for epidemiologists from ASEAN states at the Vladivostok Research Centre of Biosecurity in the Asia-Pacific region. In November and December, we will hold a new series of relevant advanced training courses on that platform, which representatives of the regional countries are welcome to attend. I would like to note that Russia is seeking to make a real contribution to efforts aimed at ensuring free and non-discriminatory access to vaccines against COVID-19 for citizens of all states. We are in favour of developing a procedure involving reciprocal recognition of vaccination certificates, without which it is practically impossible to support the unrestricted movement of citizens of our countries across the region. The use of Russian vaccines, primarily Sputnik V, has been approved by 70 countries, and they are supplied to more than 50. We are grateful to many partners in the Asia-Pacific Region for our joint work to localise the production of vaccines. We will continue to provide Russian test kits and reagents needed for diagnosing COVID-19, including free of charge. Protecting mental health and rendering psychological support is of particular importance against the background of the pandemic and related tough restrictions, including the need to stay at home or go into self-isolation. For this reason, we certainly support the initiative of the Brunei chairmanship to approve a separate thematic statement following today's meeting. In general, we suggest that a regional mechanism for anti-pandemic collaboration be established under the aegis of the East Asia Summits, and we will shortly submit specific considerations on this score via the expert channels. Colleagues, We believe it is quite important for the states in this region to engage in the further strengthening of trade and economic ties, the more so that business activity is gradually recovering. Russia, for one, has managed to reach the pre-crisis level, with GDP growth amounting to 3.7 percent on August 2020. During the first eight months of 2021, Russia's trade with countries participating in the East Asia Summits grew by more than 34 percent to $162 billion. The states present here account for $18.5 billion in direct accumulated investment into the Russian economy, which is more than a twofold increase over five years. We should support the incipient economic recovery by taking additional measures to stimulate the backbone industries of our economies and by seeking further coordination of efforts in this area. We believe that tourism deserves special attention. It is one of the sectors that have been hardest hit by COVID-19. Meanwhile, for some countries that are taking part in this summit, tourism is the main provider of jobs: before the pandemic, it generated about 10 or more percent of their incomes. In view of this, Russia has suggested adopting a joint statement in support of the tourist industry, following today's discussion. There is also a specific initiative – to organise a meeting of the heads of relevant departments as early as next January, on the sidelines of the ASEAN Tourist Forum in Cambodia, and then to make such contacts regular. No less urgent are the tasks of stepping up growth in other branches of the economy, including industry, power engineering and finances. With these goals in view, we would consider it useful to prepare and submit for approval by the leaders next year a roadmap of cooperation between the participants in East Asia Summits on the entire range of economic issues. We also support a proposal on adopting a statement on sustainable recovery, based on the outcome of our summit. The priorities mentioned in it, such as efforts to counter climate change, encourage innovation in decarbonisation and develop technology and sectors with low emission levels, require smooth, concerted cooperation from all of us. And, of course, we are interested in the closest cooperation on digitisation with the participants in the East Asia Summits. Digital technology is very helpful in resolving the comprehensive goal of strengthening coherence in the region, developing its infrastructure and trade, and creating transport-and-logistics corridors. We hope for positive results from the project on innovation for the smart and sustainable cities of Russia and ASEAN. We are launching it as part of our partnership dialogue with the association. Our capital, Moscow, which is among the world's top seven smart cities, will play a most active role in this project. Finally, I would be remiss not to mention that along with the need to overcome all of the above pressing challenges in healthcare as well as on the social track and in the economy in general, it is important not to relax our joint efforts to maintain regional stability and security. This is all the more relevant given the fact that the number of challenges and threats in the Asia-Pacific region is not decreasing, but growing with old conflicts being exacerbated and new ones emerging. In particular, we have repeatedly noted that with the termination of the INF Treaty, the region is facing the possibility of assault weapons being deployed in its vast territory, and accordingly, the prospect for a new round of the arms race. Realising the danger of such a turn of events, Russia, as you are aware, has announced a unilateral moratorium on the deployment of intermediate and short-range missiles in the APR and other regions and called for a serious discussion on this subject with all stakeholders. Russia's proposal remains in force and has even become more relevant. To reiterate, Russia has consistently advocated forming a system of equal and indivisible security in the APR and strengthening the atmosphere of constructive cooperation based on international law, including respect for the sovereignty, equality and consideration of each other's interests. We believe this is the only way to cut short existing and emerging threats and to address pressing issues facing our region and the international community, as well as to effectively interact in the interests of sustainable development and improving people's well-being. Russia will continue to contribute to this joint work. Thank you."

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67002,Meeting with Sberbank CEO German Gref,2021-10-26T14:05:00Z,"The Kremlin, Moscow",Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with CEO and Chairman of the Management Board of Sberbank German Gref.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: I know everything is going well, and the bank is actively developing. A record profit, is that right? Chairman of the Management Board of Sberbank German Gref: Yes, Mr President. This year we will probably make a profit in excess of a trillion rubles. In this sense, this year has probably been one of the most successful. First, we have seen an economic recovery compared to the previous pandemic year; we have seen a revival in industry, a recovery in demand for credit resources. Our initial projections for lending growth were far less optimistic. What we can see now is that lending to legal entities has already increased by about 3 percent. At the same time, SME lending is up 28 percent, which means a very rapid recovery from the pandemic. Lending to individuals is also doing fine. We had thought mortgage lending would fall drastically after the end of the government programme for a number of categories, but nevertheless, this year, we expect an increase compared to last year, when the preferential mortgage programme was in effect. Surprisingly, demand is very high; developers, along with banks, are beginning to stimulate the market, trying to compensate for the scrapping of the state programme for some people, lowering prices and offering special discounts. In general, we are very close to the level we had with government subsidies. True, mortgage issuance fell sharply at a certain point; but now the segment is gradually recovering. There is good growth in demand for mortgages among families with children, who are still entitled to join the state programme. Overall, we can see rapid economic recovery. This year, according to our estimates, economic growth will be around 4.5 percent, at least 4.5 percent, and expectations for next year are generally quite good. Vladimir Putin: Were you expecting about 3 percent? German Gref: Yes. The growth is 1.5 times higher than expected. And next year – it will depend on the market situation, of course, but expectations are quite good, also around 3 percent next year. Growth is higher than originally expected. Vladimir Putin: What is the structure of the portfolio in general? Has it changed this year? German Gref: Yes. Lending to individuals in our bank is growing five times faster than lending to legal entities. So, over the past six years or so we have had a general trend towards alignment between the portfolios of legal entities and those of individuals. It was about 70 to 30 and now it is already around 60 to 40. We are very undercredited, and our mortgage is on a very low level relative to the GDP. We believe our mortgage lending is growing 2.5 times relative to the GDP, as is normal for countries with comparable demand. So we are likely to have demand in the construction and construction materials markets in the next few years, which is good. If the wave of inflation does not affect us as much and does not continue at its current pace (unfortunately, metals and other things have become much more expensive and housing prices have soared, of course) we would consider mortgage and construction as one of the drivers of economic growth. As for the technological transformation, we are moving forward in accordance with our plans. We will most certainly transfer about 80 percent of all our systems to our new platform, which we have created entirely by ourselves, before the end of next year and we will not depend on imported software. We will still depend on hardware, of course, but software… Vladimir Putin: But this is a key issue. German Gref: Yes. Under the plan, we will practically complete the transition before the end of 2023. In 2021–2022, we should complete 80 percent, according to our plan. Right now we are on track with our plan and are even a bit ahead of it, so I think these two years are critical for the bank's transformation. The first problem is, of course, technological independence regarding software. The second matter is certainly the speed of transactions and labour intensity. In 2021 alone, we increased the efficiency of our systems by 50 percent, which is a big leap. This is a result of the introduction of new, cloud instruments. It makes our work reliable – we have far fewer failures and it allows us to develop at the same time. This year, we will make 80 percent more changes in our system than in the previous year, using the same personnel. Of course, this becomes possible owing to the introduction of the new platform, new systemic and cloud solutions. This year, we made additional payments, which was a big burden. We worked very closely with the Government. I also want to thank the Ministry of Communications, the Pension Fund and the Ministry of Labour. All of them worked very well and we did not have a single setback. We were very worried about the September payments, because we had to make three payments in one go, and this was the heaviest burden ever on our employees and our system. But by good fortune, everything went without a hitch. For two days, we asked our employees to work until the last customer was dealt with and our offices were working as long as people visited them. Considering that these were elderly people, we certainly tried to make their visits as comfortable as possible. We tried to eliminate queues. The average waiting time did not exceed five minutes. This happened inconspicuously but there was a lot of work behind it, of course. Now the Government is working very hard on creating the social treasury. In principle, it will be a prototype of potential targeted payments to the people that need them for various reasons. I believe that in the near future we will be able to do much more to overcome poverty with the help of digital technology. Vladimir Putin: Good. <…>"

It is important that the comprehensive and balanced action programme developed by Saudi specialists provides for the widespread use of advanced technologies, including for ensuring the rational use of natural resources and planting greenery in large desert areas. The implementation of such an ambitious project will certainly promote major environmental improvements in the Middle East and will become a significant contribution to global efforts on the environmental track. I would like to wish our Saudi and other Middle Eastern partners success in advancing this green initiative and reaffirm that Russia, in turn, is ready to build up comprehensive international cooperation in protecting the environment."""
http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/66993,Meeting with Head of the Federal Customs Service Vladimir Bulavin,2021-10-25T13:50:00Z,"Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region",Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with Head of the Federal Customs Service Vladimir Bulavin.,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: I know that you wanted to start our today's meeting by discussing transformations and how the reform of our Customs Service is proceeding. Please, let us begin. Head of the Federal Customs Service Vladimir Bulavin: Mr President, a year ago, I already reported to you that, in 2020, we had implemented sweeping transformations and a large-scale reform of the customs administration system. The reform was conducted under your decision and was accompanied by a substantial restructuring of customs agencies and an in-depth digital transformation of the customs process. We established online customs declaration centres, a chain of distributed centres– a total of 16 facilities, online customs offices, and the customs offices have been converted into customs facilities and monitoring posts. As it happens, 2021, on the one hand, marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the Federal Customs Service, and on the other hand, this is the first year that the Federal Customs Service has virtually worked within a system of new coordinates. Although the year is not over yet, it is possible to sum up certain results. In our opinion, the main principles of the reform that have been implemented have proved their worth. Most importantly, we have managed to accomplish two main tasks: Customs clearance has become faster, more transparent and more convenient for foreign economic operators, and the administrative burden on businesses has been reduced considerably. On the other hand, customs clearance has become more cost-effective for the state in the context of fulfilling customs agencies' fiscal function. In the long run, we believe that all this has helped expand nationwide trade volumes. I would like to dwell briefly on all these matters. We managed to digitise almost all customs procedures during the reform. For example, our information systems process 860 million entries daily. It takes five seconds to write off customs payments from a single personal account, four seconds for the risk management system to check for customs risks, one second to send a request for data to the digital archive, and about 30 seconds to send request to another federal executive body for information that we need for customs clearance. This made it possible to automate individual customs clearance procedures. This year, we have issued four million declarations in nine months, of which 3.2 million declarations were automatically entered into the system and slightly over one million were automatically issued. One electronic declaration is automatically issued in four minutes without any human input, which means quickly, efficiently and objectively. In general, for risk-free supplies, it takes on average one hour and ten minutes that is, 70 minutes, to issue an electronic import declaration, and 36 minutes to issue an export declaration. Almost 80 percent of all declarations are issued within four hours, which is what the EAEU Customs Code specifies. We believe this has had a significant impact on our relations with business entities. Almost 100 percent of the declarations are submitted online. All other contacts with the participants in foreign economic activity are maintained using the Personal Account of a Participant in Foreign Economic Activity service which can be used to submit a declaration online, make the necessary customs payments, check the status of current accounts, and submit the necessary documents, if requested. To reiterate, we have achieved our goal of making the customs clearance process faster, more efficient and user friendly. And second, of course, it must be said that the customs procedure has become more effective for the state. This year we have transferred 4.8 trillion rubles to the federal budget over nine months. The forecast task has been exceeded by 133 percent: we have transferred 1.2 trillion more to the budget than the forecast task that we had. It is generally accepted that customs payments are mainly export payments. The results of nine months of our work show that two-thirds are payments for imports and one-third for exports, that is, we have transferred 3.2 trillion in import and 1.6 trillion in export payments. It should be noted that overall, this year the Russian Federation's trade grew 35 percent compared with the first nine months of last year and amounted to US$540 billion. Our exports amount to US$310 billion and imports to US$230 billion, which means we have a generally positive balance. Of course, these volumes have different elements: the growth in value of both imports and exports or payments introduced for the supply of grain and timber; but at the same time, we believe that there is also such an element as the efficiency of customs clearance at the electronic declaration centres. We are handling the increasing bulk of trade quite well. I would like to note our cooperation with the railway. This year we have moved our joint work online, which means that now we have ensured that electronic documents are provided once and the zero VAT for exporters is confirmed online, which has had a significant impact on the movement of goods along the railway. In general, their volumes have grown almost 1.5 times. Transit on our railways has also grown significantly. The railway has a profit of about 50 billion rubles from transit alone. This year, the container traffic will amount to more than one million containers, and this will also entail a total effect of about 60 billion rubles according to the data the railway has. This means we believe that the reforms we have carried have reached their goal: we have largely facilitated and sped up the customs procedures and made the customs process more business-friendly, without losing control over customs. The customs procedure is quite effective for protecting the interests of the state. Vladimir Putin: How much are you going to contribute to the budget this year? Vladimir Bulavin: For nine months, we exceeded our targets by 1.2 trillion. If the estimates are not revised upwards in the near future, I think we might exceed this figure. It is hard to make predictions right now. Vladimir Putin: The Government will hear you and make adjustments. You have an extensive programme for upgrading checkpoints. How is it progressing, besides the electronic platforms? Vladimir Bulavin: Mr President, we are actively working with the Ministry of Transport on this, and the creation of an intelligent checkpoint is one of our joint projects– this project is included in the Customs Service Development Strategy to 2030. That is, we are developing a conceptual scheme for an intelligent checkpoint and creating a digital platform that will be used by the oversight bodies working at the checkpoints. According to our plan, this will ensure non-stop movement of goods for risk-free deliveries of consignments. I would also like to note that we are now working on creating a project for digital analysis of the images made by customs inspection complexes. We are using artificial intelligence in the customs service, since our product range includes 12,500 items, and the computer must first be taught to identify each particular consignment so that it commits them to memory so as to be able to analyse images it receives from customs inspection complexes without supervision. In addition, our joint plan with the Ministry of Transport includes equipping the checkpoint with streaming customs inspection complexes, which will scan incoming vehicles without their drivers needing to leave them. At present, it takes about six minutes to scan a vehicle. Currently, a vehicle must first stop and the driver, in order to avoid radiation, must get out, and then the vehicle gets scanned(there are two options: either the frame goes around it, or a vehicle gets pulled through the frame), and this takes about six minutes, or 10 vehicles per hour. If we continue to work like this, clearly, we will not be able to scan more than 240 vehicles[per day]. During the summer, when the workload is heavy, 500 or even more vehicles pass through our checkpoints. Vladimir Putin: I see. What areas require special attention? Vladimir Bulavin: We are aware of these checkpoints. Currently, they include Burachki, European direction, and the Pskov Region where the checkpoint is being renovated. Upper Lars in Georgia is always a problem. This year, this checkpoint was closed for about 90 days due to bad weather with snow drifts and avalanches. Lower Zaramag in Azerbaijan is also being renovated. All three checkpoints are under renovation. Vladimir Putin: Good. Thank you. <…>"

You are making a major personal contribution to strengthening relations of strategic partnership and allied interaction between our countries. I am confident that we will continue to expand practical cooperation in various spheres through joint efforts and interact constructively in addressing topical matters of the regional and global agenda.

http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/66987,Greetings to current staff and veterans of Russia's customs agencies,2021-10-25T09:00:00Z,NA,"The President congratulated current staff and veterans of the Russian Federation's customs agencies on their professional holiday, Customs Officer Day.","President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, I would like to offer my sincere greetings to all current and retired officers of the Federal Customs Service on their professional holiday and the 30th anniversary of establishing customs agencies in Russia. Their officers have continued the best traditions of many generations of their predecessors as the history of the national Customs Service goes back by many centuries. The Customs Service has changed considerably over the years. An efficient and powerful agency was established following various transformations. Today, it serves as a solid pillar of the state and reliably ensures the country's national interests. The Federal Customs Service of Russia plays a significant role in replenishing the federal budget, helps expand foreign trade ties and improve the business environment. It addresses these and many other tasks in a responsible manner and with good results. Your large and close-knit team deserves credit for this. Thank you for your work and for your dedication to your professional duty. I am confident that every person who has decided to serve the Motherland should abide by the same high requirements. It is also important that you keep up with the times and improve the forms and methods of your work. For this purpose, you master advanced processes, including digital technologies, and strive to turn the Customs Service into a truly up-to-date and dynamic state agency. I would like to note that the wide-scale introduction of interactive electronic services made it possible to radically reduce the time required for customs clearance. These procedures have become faster, more convenient and more understandable for the public, representatives of small and medium-sized businesses and major companies. This certainly makes the Russian economy more competitive and, what is very important, this makes people's life more comfortable. At the same time, various matters still have to be resolved as fast as possible. There are ample reserves for more transparent and simpler customs clearance procedures and for improving your Service's overall performance. It is necessary to set the highest standards here, and to be guided by national interests and people's needs. I expect the Federal Customs Service to continue expanding open dialogue with the business community and strengthening society's trust. Your unconditional priorities include active assistance to deepening integration processes in the Eurasian region and expanding cooperation with your colleagues from the Eurasian Economic Union and other countries. In conclusion, I would like to once again congratulate you on your professional holiday and the anniversary of the Customs Service. I wish you every success for the benefit of Russia, happiness, health and all the best to you and your families and loved ones."

You can be rightly proud of the school's rich history and its tremendous contribution to the development of musical art and Russia's culture in general, as well as several generations of outstanding tutors and mentors. It is largely thanks to their selfless and sincere love for their students that the names and the brilliant performing art of the Gnessin School's talented graduates are famous throughout the world."""
